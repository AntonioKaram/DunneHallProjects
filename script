[<div class="full-script">Man:
Kids, I'm gonna tell you
<br/>An incredible story;
<br/>The story of how
<br/>I met your mother.
<br/>Are we being punished
for something?
<br/>No.
<br/>Yeah, is this gonna
take a while?
<br/>Yes. 25 years ago,
before I was dad,
<br/>I had this whole other life.
<br/>It was way back in 2005.
<br/>I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect
<br/>And living in new york
with marshall,
<br/>My best friend from college.
<br/>My life was good.
<br/>And then uncle marshall went
and screwed the whole thing up.
<br/>Will you marry me?
<br/>Yes.
<br/>Perfect!
And then you're engaged.
<br/>You pop the champagne.
You drink a toast.
<br/>You have sex
on the kitchen floor.
<br/>Don't have sex
on our kitchen floor.
<br/>Got it.
<br/>Thanks for helping me
plan this out, ted.
<br/>Dude, are you kidding?
<br/>I've been there
for all the big moments
of you and lilly:
<br/>Night you met,
<br/>Your first date,
other first things.
<br/>Yeah, sorry.
<br/>We thought you were asleep.
<br/>It's physics, marshall.
<br/>If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.
<br/>My god.
<br/>You're getting engaged tonight.
<br/>Yeah.
<br/>What are you doin' tonight?
<br/>What was I doing?
<br/>Here uncle marshall was taking
the biggest step of his life.
<br/>I'm calling up
your uncle barney.
<br/>Hey, so you know
how I've always had a thing
<br/>For half-asian girls?
<br/>Well, now I've got
a new favorite-- lebanese girls.
<br/>Lebanese girls
are the new half-asians.
<br/>Hey, you want
to do somethin' tonight?
<br/>Okay, meet me at the bar
in 15 minutes. And suit up!
<br/>Hey.
<br/>Where's your suit?
Just once,
<br/>When I say suit up,
I wish you'd put on a suit.
<br/>I did that one time.
<br/>It was a blazer!
<br/>You know,
<br/>Ever since college
it's been, marshall
and lilly and me.
<br/>Now, it's gonna be
marshall and lilly...
<br/>And me.
<br/>They'll get married,
start a family.
<br/>Before long,
I'm that weird,
middle-aged bachelor
<br/>Their kids call
uncle ted.
<br/>I see what this is about.
<br/>Have you forgotten
what I said to you
the night we met?
<br/>Ted, I'm gonna teach
you how to live.
<br/>Barney.
We met at the urinal.
<br/>Oh, right. Right.
<br/>Lesson one:
Lose the goatee.
<br/>It doesn't go
with your suit.
<br/>I'm not wearing a suit.
<br/>Lesson two: Get a suit.
<br/>Suits are cool.
Exhibit "a."
<br/>Lesson three:
Don't even think
<br/>About getting married
till you're 30.
<br/>30. Right.
You're right.
<br/>I guess it's just,
your best friend
gets engaged,
<br/>You start thinking
about that stuff.
<br/>I thought I was
your best friend.
<br/>Ted, say
I'm your best friend.
<br/>You're my best
friend, barney.
<br/>Good. Then,
as your best friend,
<br/>I suggest we play
a little game
<br/>I like to call
"have you met ted?"
<br/>Wait. No, no, no.
We're not playing
"have you met ted?"
<br/>Hi, have you met ted?
<br/>Hi,
<br/>I'm ted.
<br/>Yasmine.
<br/>That's a very pretty name.
<br/>Thanks. It's lebanese.
<br/>Hey.
<br/>( sighs)
<br/>I'm exhausted.
<br/>It was finger-painting day
at school,
<br/>And a five year-old boy got
to second base with me.
<br/>Wow! You're cooking?
<br/>Yes, I am.
<br/>Aw...
<br/>Are you sure
that's a good idea?
<br/>After last time, you looked
really creepy without eyebrows.
<br/>I think you'll
find I'm full of
surprises tonight.
<br/>So, there's more surprises?
Likewhat?
<br/>Marshall was in his second year
of law school,
<br/>So he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.
<br/>Boogedyboo!
<br/>And that's all of 'em.
<br/>I'm gonna go... Cook.
<br/>I'm so happy for marshall,
I really am.
<br/>I just couldn't imagine
settling down right now.
<br/>So, do you think
you'll ever get married?
<br/>Well, maybe eventually...
Some fall day,
<br/>Possibly in central park.
<br/>Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.
<br/>Band, no dj.
People will dance!
<br/>I'm not gonna worry
about it!
<br/>Damn it, why did marshall
have to get engaged?
<br/>Yeah, nothing hotter
<br/>Than a guy planning out
his own imaginary wedding, huh?
<br/>Actually,
I think it's cute.
<br/>Well, you're clearly drunk.
<br/>One more for the lady!
<br/>Oh, hey,
look what I got.
<br/>Oh, honey! Champagne.
<br/>No. You are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.
<br/>I'm not scared.
<br/>Then open it.
<br/>Fine.
<br/>Please open it?
<br/>You are unbelievable,
marshall.
<br/>There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.
<br/>One, you plan out for months.
<br/>The other just slips out when
you're half drunk at some bar.
<br/>Will you marry me?
<br/>You wanna go out
sometime?
<br/>Of course, you idiot!
<br/>I'm sorry,
carl's my boyfriend.
<br/>'sup, carl?
<br/>( both sigh )
<br/>I promised ted
we wouldn't do that.
<br/>Did you know
there's a pop tart
under your fridge?
<br/>No, but dibs.
<br/>Where's that champagne?
<br/>I wanna drink a toast
with my fiancée.
<br/>Oh!
<br/>I don't know why
I was so scared of this.
<br/>It's pretty easy, right?
<br/>Oh!
( lilly shrieks)
<br/>Why am I freaking out
all of a sudden?
<br/>This is crazy.
I'm not ready
to settle down.
<br/>How does carl land
a lebanese girl?
<br/>The plan has always been
<br/>Don't even think about it
until you're 30.
<br/>Exactly. The guy doesn't
even own a suit.
<br/>Plus, marshall's found
the love of his life.
<br/>Even if I was ready,
which I'm not...
<br/>But if I was,
it's, like,
<br/>"okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"
<br/>( romantic music plays)
<br/>And there she was.
<br/>It was like something
from an old movie,
<br/>Where the sailor sees the girl
<br/>Across the crowded dance floor,
<br/>Turns to his buddy and says,
"see that girl?
<br/>I'm gonna marry her someday."
<br/>Hey, barney,
see that girl?
<br/>Oh, yeah. You just know
she likes it dirty.
<br/>Go say hi.
<br/>I can't just go say hi.
<br/>I need a plan.
<br/>I'm gonna wait
until she goes
to the bathroom,
<br/>Then I'll strategically place
myself by the jukebox...
<br/>Hi, have you met ted?
<br/>Hi.
<br/>Let me guess...
<br/>Ted.
<br/>Sorry, lilly.
I'm so sorry.
<br/>Take us to the hospital.
<br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<br/>Did you hit her?
<br/>( both laugh )
<br/>This guy can barely
even spank me in
bed for fun.
<br/>He's all like, "oh, honey.
Did that hurt?"
<br/>And, I'm like,
"come on!
<br/>Let me have it,
you pansy!"
<br/>Wow, a complete stranger.
<br/>No, no, no, no! It's okay.
Go on.
<br/>So, these,
uh, spankings...
<br/>You in pajamas
or au naturel?
<br/>So, what do you do?
<br/>I'm a reporter
for metro news one.
<br/>Oh.
<br/>Well, kind of a reporter.
<br/>I do those dumb
little fluff pieces
<br/>At the end of the news.
<br/>You know, like, um...
Monkey who can play
the ukulele.
<br/>I'm hoping to get
some bigger stories soon.
<br/>Bigger, like, uh...
Gorilla with an upright bass?
<br/>Sorry.
You're really pretty.
<br/>( laughs)
<br/>Oh, your friends
don't seem to happy.
<br/>Yeah, see, the one
in the middle just
got dumped
<br/>By her boyfriend.
<br/>So, tonight, every guy
is "the enemy."
<br/>You know if it'll make
your friend feel better,
<br/>You could throw a drink
in my face. I don't mind.
<br/>She would love that!
<br/>And it does look
fun in the movies.
<br/>Hey, you wanna have dinner
with me Saturday night?
<br/>Oh, I can't.
I'm going to orlando
for a week on Friday.
<br/>Some guy's attempting to make
the world's biggest pancake.
<br/>Guess who's covering it?
<br/>That's gonna take a week?
<br/>Yeah, he's gonna
eat it, too.
<br/>It's another record.
<br/>Hey! What's takin' so long?
<br/>Uh, I know this
is a long shot,
<br/>But how 'bout tomorrow night?
<br/>Yeah. What the hell?
<br/>Jerk!
<br/>That was fun.
<br/>De... Wait for it...
<br/>Nied!
<br/>Denied!
<br/>We're goin' out
tomorrow night.
<br/>I thought we were playin'
laser tag tomorrow night.
<br/>Yeah, I was never gonna
go play laser tag.
<br/>The next night,
I took her out
<br/>To this little bistro
in brooklyn.
<br/>Wow!
<br/>That is one badass
blue french horn.
<br/>Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
<br/>Sort of looks
like a smurf penis.
<br/>Son, a piece of advice:
When you go on a first date,
<br/>You really don't wanna say
"smurf penis."
<br/>Girls don't
ordinarily like that.
<br/>But this was no ordinary girl.
<br/>( laughing )
<br/>Lilly?
<br/>( table clatters)
<br/>How long have
you been sitting there?
<br/>Stupid eye patch.
<br/>Mom, dad,
<br/>I have found
the future mrs. Ted mosby.
<br/>Marshall, how have I always
<br/>Described my perfect woman?
<br/>Now, let's see...
<br/>She likes dogs?
<br/>I've got five dogs.
<br/>She drinks scotch?
<br/>I love a scotch that's old
<br/>Enough to order its own scotch.
<br/>Can quote obscure lines
from ghostbusters?
<br/>Ray! When someone asks you
if you're a god, you say "yes!"
<br/>And I'm saving
the best for last.
<br/>Do you want these?
I hate olives.
<br/>She hates olives! Awesome!
<br/>The olive theory.
<br/>The olive theory
is based on my friends
marshall and lilly.
<br/>He hates olives,
she loves them.
<br/>In a weird way,
that's what makes
them such a great couple.
<br/>Perfect balance.
<br/>You know, I've had
a jar of olives
<br/>Just sitting
in my fridge forever.
<br/>I could take 'em
off your hands.
<br/>They're all yours.
<br/>Oh, it is on!
<br/>It is on
<br/>( singing):
Till the break of dawn.
<br/>But wait.
<br/>It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?
<br/>I gotta get one
of those blue
french horns
<br/>For over my fireplace.
<br/>It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be french.
<br/>No green clarinet?
<br/>Nope.
Come on.
No purple tuba?
<br/>It's a smurf penis
or no dice.
<br/>( laughs)
<br/>Woman:
There you are!
<br/>We got a jumper.
<br/>Some crazy guy
on the manhattan bridge.
<br/>Come on. You're coverin' it!
<br/>Um... All right.
I'll be right there.
<br/>I'm sorry.
<br/>I had a really
great time tonight.
<br/>Yeah.
<br/>So?!
<br/>Did you kiss her?
<br/>No. The moment wasn't right.
<br/>Look, this woman
could actually be
my future wife.
<br/>I want our first kiss
to be amazing.
<br/>Aw, ted, that is so sweet.
<br/>So you chickened out
like a little bitch.
<br/>What? I did not chicken out.
<br/>You know what?
<br/>I don't need to take
first kiss advice
<br/>From some pirate
who hasn't been single
<br/>Since the first week of college.
<br/>Anyone who's single
would tell you
the same thing,
<br/>Even the dumbest
single person alive.
<br/>And if you don't believe me,
call him.
<br/>( rock music playing)
<br/>Hey, loser.
<br/>How's not playing laser tag?
<br/>Because playing
laser tag is awesome!
<br/>Oh, I killed you,
conner!
<br/>Don't make me
get your mom!
<br/>Hey, listen.
I need your opinion
on something.
<br/>Okay, meet me
at the bar in
15 minutes.
<br/>And suit up!
<br/>So, these guys
think I chickened out.
<br/>What do you think?
<br/>I can't believe you're
still not wearing a suit.
<br/>She didn't even
give me the signal.
<br/>What, is she gonna, she gonna
<br/>Bat her eyes at you
in morse code?
<br/>"ted...
<br/>Kiss me."
<br/>No! You just kiss her!
<br/>Not if you don't
get the signal.
<br/>Did marshall
give me the signal?
<br/>No!
<br/>I didn't. I swear.
<br/>But, see,
at least tonight,
<br/>I get to sleep knowing
marshall and me,
<br/>Never gonna happen.
<br/>You should have
kissed her.
<br/>Oh, I should have kissed her.
<br/>Well, maybe in a week when
she gets back from orlando.
<br/>A week? That's like
a year in hot girl time.
<br/>She'll forget all about you.
<br/>Mark my words-- you will
never see that one again.
<br/>There she is.
<br/>Ooh! She's cute.
<br/>Hey, carl,
turn it up.
<br/>...Persuaded him to reconsider.
<br/>At which point, the man
came down off the ledge,
<br/>Giving this bizarre story
a happy ending.
<br/>Reporting from metro one news...
Huh.
<br/>Guy didn't jump.
<br/>I'm gonna go kiss her.
<br/>Right now.
<br/>Look, dude.
It's midnight.
<br/>As your future lawyer,
<br/>I'm gonna advise you
that's freakin' crazy.
<br/>I never do anything crazy.
<br/>I'm always
waiting for the moment,
<br/>Planning the moment.
<br/>Well, she's leaving tomorrow.
<br/>This may be
the only moment I'm gonna get.
<br/>I gotta do what
that guy couldn't.
<br/>I gotta take the leap!
<br/>Okay, not a perfect metaphor,
<br/>'cause for me it's fall
in love and get married,
<br/>And for him it's... Death.
<br/>Actually, that
is a perfect metaphor.
<br/>By the way, did I
congratulate you two?
<br/>I'm doing this.
<br/>Let's go.
<br/>Word up.
<br/>We're coming
with you.
<br/>Barney?
<br/>All right,
<br/>But under one condition.
<br/>Look at you, you
beautiful bastard.
<br/>You suited up!
<br/>This is totally
going in my blog!
<br/>Stop the car.
<br/>Uh, pull over
right here.
<br/>I gotta do something.
<br/>Excuse me. Pardon me.
<br/>Just a sec'.
Enjoy your coffee.
<br/>Hey!
<br/>Hey!
<br/>Go! Go! Go!
<br/>Everybody
brings flowers.
<br/>( exhales)
<br/>Okay.
Moment of truth.
<br/>Wish me luck.
<br/>Ted's gonna get it on
with a tv reporter.
<br/>"this just in." okay.
<br/>Kiss her, ted!
<br/>Kiss her good!
<br/>Kiss the crap
outta that girl!
<br/>Marshall, remember this night.
<br/>When you're the best man
at our wedding
<br/>And you give a speech,
you're gonna tell this story.
<br/>Why does he get
to be the best man?
<br/>I'm your
best friend!
<br/>As I walked up to that door,
<br/>A million thoughts
raced through my mind.
<br/>Unfortunately, one particular
thought did not.
<br/>I've got five dogs.
<br/>( doorbell buzzes, barking )
<br/>Not good. Not good.
Not good. Not good. Not good.
<br/>No!
<br/>Get back in there!
<br/>You're wearing
a suit!
<br/>( barking continues )
<br/>Ted?
<br/>Hi.
<br/>I was just, uh...
<br/>Come on up.
<br/>Marshall:
He's in.
<br/>So...
<br/>Ranjit, you must have done
it with a lebanese girl?
<br/>Okay, that's
my barney limit.
<br/>I'm gonna see if that bodega
has a bathroom.
<br/>Actually,
I'm from bangladesh.
<br/>The women hot there?
<br/>Here's a picture
of my wife.
<br/>A simple "no" would
have sufficed.
<br/>She's lovely.
<br/>So, ted,
<br/>What brings you back
to brooklyn
<br/>At 1:00 in the morning
in a suit?
<br/>I was just hoping to...
<br/>Get those olives...
That you said I could have.
<br/>Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?
<br/>Are you trying to get me drunk?
<br/>For starters.
<br/>( romantic music plays)
<br/>So, marshall,
this olive theory,
<br/>Based on you and lilly?
<br/>Yeah.
<br/>You hate olives.
<br/>Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.
<br/>Yeah. Hate olives.
<br/>Two weeks ago, spanish bar
on 79th street,
<br/>Dish of olives, you had some--
what up?
<br/>You have to swear that this
does not leave this cab.
<br/>I swear.
<br/>I swear.
<br/>On our first date,
<br/>I ordered a greek salad.
<br/>Lilly asked if she
could have my olives.
<br/>I said, "sure. I hate olives."
<br/>But, you like olives.
<br/>Well, I was 18, okay?
I was a virgin.
<br/>Been waitin' my whole life for
a pretty girl to want my olives.
<br/>Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.
<br/>Don't get married.
<br/>♪ baby, since I met you, oh...
<br/>I think I like
your olive theory.
<br/>I think I like
your new french horn.
<br/>I think I like your nose.
<br/>I think I'm
in love with you.
<br/>What?!
What?!
What?!
<br/>What?
What?
<br/>What?
<br/>Come on, man,
you said
<br/>Your stomach's been
hurting, right?
<br/>You know what that is.
<br/>Hunger.
<br/>You're hungry for experience.
<br/>Hungry for something new.
<br/>Hungry for olives.
<br/>But you're too scared
to do anything about it.
<br/>Yeah, I'm scared,
okay?
<br/>But, when I think
of spending
<br/>The rest of my life
with lilly--
<br/>Committing, forever,
no other women--
<br/>Doesn't scare me at all.
<br/>I'm marrying that girl.
<br/>Lilly.
<br/>Lilly, I like olives.
<br/>We'll make it work.
<br/>Aw...
<br/>So, orlando.
<br/>You gonna
hit disneyworld?
<br/>You love me?!
<br/>I-I-I can't believe
I said that.
<br/>Why did I say that?
<br/>Who says that?
<br/>I should just go.
<br/>Hold on.
<br/>Wait a minute.
<br/>Promised you these.
<br/>Olives.
Yeah.
<br/>Thanks. I love you.
<br/>What is wrong
with me?
<br/>Why are we still
sitting here?
<br/>Let's go. We can still
make last call.
<br/>What do you say, lil?
<br/>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum?
<br/>'cause you're a pirate.
<br/>Okay, eye patch, gone.
<br/>And we can't just
abandon ted.
<br/>If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.
<br/>It's been,
like, 20 minutes.
<br/>You think they're doin' it?
<br/>You think they're doin' it
in front of the dogs?
<br/>Doggy style.
( laughing )
<br/>Hey, there was
a girl in college,
<br/>She had this golden
retriever...
<br/>Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.
<br/>Hit it, ranjit.
<br/>So, when you tell
this story to your friends,
<br/>Could you avoid
the word "psycho?"
<br/>I'd prefer... "eccentric."
<br/>Good night... Psycho.
<br/>Great.
<br/>Um, how do I get to the f train?
<br/>Oh, um, two blocks
<br/>That way and take a right.
<br/>You know what?
<br/>I'm done being single.
<br/>I'm not good at it.
<br/>Look, obviously,
<br/>You can't tell a woman
you just met you love her.
<br/>But...
It sucks that you can't.
<br/>I'll tell you something, though.
<br/>If a woman-- not you, just some
hypothetical woman--
<br/>Were to bear with me
through all this,
<br/>I think I'd make
a damn good husband.
<br/>Because, that's
the stuff I'd be good at,
<br/>Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father.
<br/>And walking her five
hypothetical dogs.
<br/>Being a good kisser.
<br/>Everyone thinks
they're a good kisser.
<br/>Oh, I've got references.
<br/>Good night, ted.
<br/>And I'm a good handshaker.
<br/>That's a pretty
great handshake.
<br/>And that was it.
<br/>I'll probably
never see her again.
<br/>What?
<br/>That was the signal.
<br/>That long,
lingering handshake?
<br/>You should have kissed her.
<br/>There's no such thing
as "the signal."
<br/>But, yeah,
that was the signal.
<br/>Signal.
<br/>Ah, carl,
thank you.
<br/>Something
I gotta do.
<br/>By the way,
<br/>You should have kissed her.
<br/>Carl!
You guys weren't there.
<br/>( cork pops )
<br/>I am so turned
on right now.
<br/>Ted:
Guys, trust me.
<br/>I've seen the signal.
<br/>That was not the signal.
<br/>Yeah, ted, we're
not on you anymore.
<br/>To my fiancée.
<br/>To the future.
<br/>To one hell
of a night!
<br/>That was not the signal.
<br/>I asked her
about it years later.
<br/>And, yeah, that was the signal.
<br/>I could have kissed her.
<br/>But that's the funny
thing about destiny.
<br/>It happens
whether you plan it or not.
<br/>I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again,
<br/>But it turns out I was just
too close to the puzzle
<br/>To see the picture
that was forming.
<br/>Because, that, kids,
<br/>Is the true story of how
I met your aunt robin.
<br/>Aunt robin?
<br/>I thought this was
how you met mom!
<br/>Will you relax?
<br/>I'm getting to it.
<br/>Like I said, it's a long story. </div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Okay, where was I?
You were telling us<br/>how you met mom.
In excruciating detail.
Right.
So, back in 2005,
When I was 27,
My two best friends got engaged,
And it got me thinking,<br/>maybe I should get married.
And then I saw robin.
She was incredible.
I just knew I had to meet her.
That's where<br/>your uncle barney came in.
I suggest we play<br/>a little game I like to call
Wait, no, no, no.<br/>We're not playing<br/>"have you met ted?"
Hi. Have you met ted?
So I asked her out.
But after just one date,<br/>I was in love with her
Which made me say<br/>something stupid.
I think I'm in love with you.
What?!
Oh, dad.
So then what happened?
Nothing.
I mean, I'd made<br/>a complete fool of myself.
So, a week went by,<br/>and I decided not to call her.
So you're not gonna call her?
You went from,<br/>"I think I'm<br/>in love with you"
To "I'm not gonna call her"?
I wasn't in love with her, okay?
I was briefly in love<br/>with the abstract concept
Of getting married.
It had absolutely<br/>nothing to do with robin.
Robin.
Hi.
Look who I ran into.
Since when do you guys<br/>know each other?
Oh, since about... Here.
Lily recognized me
From the news and...
Hello, sailor!
They just got engaged.
Well, I should get<br/>back to the station.
See you, guys.
Nice seeing you, ted.
Yeah, you, too.<br/>Thanks.
What? Damn it!
I'm in love with her.
As your sponsor,<br/>I will not let you relapse.
You blew it, it's over, move on.
I don't know, I just<br/>have this feeling
She's the future<br/>mrs. Ted mosby.
( Lily squeaks)
Lily, you squeaked?
She said something<br/>about me, didn't she?
Come on, spill it, red!
Fine.
So, what do we think of ted?
( Iaughs)
Ted's something else.
Huh.
I'm gonna spin that as good.
Lots of guys are something,<br/>I'm something else.
Comes on a little strong.
But, that's part of my charm.
But, that's part of his charm.
Oh, totally. I mean,<br/>he's sweet, he's charming,
He's just looking for something
A little bit more serious<br/>than I am.
I mean, the most I can handle<br/>right now is something casual.
This just stays<br/>between us, right?
Are you kidding?
This flapper?<br/>Fort knox.
Oops.
She wants casual.
Okay, I'll be casual.
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud<br/>of casual.
Cause it's a game...<br/>I want her to skip
To the end and do the whole<br/>happily-ever-after thing.
But you don't get there<br/>unless you play the game.
So, are you going<br/>to ask her out?
Yeah... No!
I can't ask her out,
Because if I ask her<br/>out, I'm asking her out.
So, how do I
Ask her out without<br/>asking her out?
Did you guys get high?
I got it.
I don't ask her out.
I invite her
To our party next Friday.
We're having<br/>a party next Friday?
We are now. Casual.
Like inviting a hundred people<br/>over just to mack on one girl.
Oh, and lily, that's my leg.
You waited five minutes<br/>to tell me that?
All right, so call her up.
No, calling's not casual.
I just got to bump<br/>into her somewhere.
Now, if only I<br/>knew her schedule,
I could arrange<br/>a chance encounter.
That's great, ted... you'll be<br/>the most casual stalker ever.
Put that ring on her finger,<br/>lily had been,
Well, extra affectionate.
( chuckling ):<br/>Baby, no.
I have a 25-page paper on<br/>constitutional law due Monday.
Hey, I'm just sitting<br/>here, wearing my ring,
My beautiful ring.
( Typing)
Kind of makes wearing<br/>other stuff seem wrong.
Like my shirt.
Kind of don't want to<br/>wear my shirt anymore.
Or...
My underwear.
That's right, I'm<br/>not wearing any.
( Sighs )
No underwear?
Not even slightly.
Ted:<br/>Guys.
Boundaries.
Robin ( on tv ):<br/>Thanks, bill.
I'm reporting from<br/>the razzle dazzle supermarket
On 75th and columbus...
75th and columbus.
Game on!
Where four-year-old<br/>leroy ellenberg has climbed
Inside a grab-a-prize machine<br/>and gotten stuck.
( Panting )
And, all in the pursuit<br/>of a stuffed, purple giraffe.
For metro news 1,<br/>I'm robin trubotsky.
Engineer:<br/>We're clear.
Robin:<br/>Thanks, don.<br/>Whew.
Ted.
Robin, wow!
What are the odds?
Oh, you know, just, uh,<br/>shopping for, uh, dip.
I love dip.
I mean, I don't love<br/>dip, I like dip...
( chuckles )<br/>so, uh, hey,<br/>you, uh,
Reporting a news<br/>story or something?
Yeah, kid stuck<br/>in a crane machine.
How sweet of you<br/>to call it news.<br/>Wow.
Kid in a crane machine.<br/>Mm-hmm.
You just had to have<br/>that toy, didn't you?
Couldn't play the game<br/>like everyone else.
You're all sweaty!
Cute kid.
Um, you know,
It's so funny<br/>I should run into you.
We're, uh, we're having a party<br/>next Friday,
If you feel like swinging by.
But, you know, whatever.
Oh, I'm going back<br/>home next weekend.
It's too bad it's not tonight.
It is... It's tonight.
This Friday.<br/>Did I say next Friday?
Sorry, I guess
I've been saying<br/>next Friday all week.
But, yeah, it's tonight,<br/>the, uh, the party's tonight.
But, you know, whatever.
( Phone rings)
Hello?
Hey, am I interrupting anything?
No, no, I'm just<br/>writing my paper.
Hitting the books.
Yeah, well, you and lily
Might want to put<br/>some clothes on.
We're throwing<br/>a party in two hours.
Okay, bye.
What are you gonna<br/>do when robin shows up?
Okay, I got it all planned out.
She steps through the door...<br/>and where's ted?
Not eagerly waiting by the door.
No, I'm across the room<br/>at my drafting table,
Showing some foxy young thing<br/>all my cool architect stuff.
So, robin strolls over, and I<br/>casually give her one of these:
"hey, what's up?"
She says, "hey, nice place,<br/>et cetera, et cetera."
And then, I say,<br/>"well, make yourself at home."
And, I casually return<br/>to my conversation.
Then, an hour later...
"oh, you're still here?"
I say, like I don't really care,
But it's a nice surprise.
And then, very casually:
Both:<br/>The roof!<br/>Get her up to the roof,
And the roof<br/>takes care of the rest.
What's so special<br/>about the roof?
Oh, the moon, the stars,<br/>the shimmering skyline.
You can't not fall in love<br/>on that roof.
We do it up there, sometimes.
Solid plan, my little friend.
But, may I suggest one<br/>little modification.
Barney:<br/>That foxy young thing<br/>you were chatting up,
Take her up to the roof<br/>and have sex with her.
Crazy monkey style...<br/>That's not the plan.
Barney:<br/>Well, it should be the plan.
I mean, look at her.
Ted, look at her.<br/>She's smoking!
Thank you!<br/>Yeah...
But, she's not robin!
Exactly!
Ted, let's rap.
Statistic: At every<br/>new york party,
There's always a girl<br/>who has no idea
Whose party she's at.
She knows no one you know,
And you will never<br/>see her again.
Do you see where I'm<br/>going with this?
Barney, I don't think so.<br/>( groans )
Scoping.
( Imitates sonar beeping )
Scoping.
Man, you're a dork.
( Accelerates beeping sound )
Target acquired!
Now it's time we<br/>play a little game
I like to call<br/>"have you met ted?"<br/>oh, come on, not this.
Hi. Have you met ted?<br/>No.
Hi. Hi.
Do you know marshall? Lily?
Woman:<br/>No.
Hmm. Do you know<br/>anyone at this party?
I work with carlos.
Excuse me.
Anyone know a carlos?
No.<br/>No.
On a silver platter.
Bon appétit.
I don't think so.
Your loss, her gain.
Excuse me.
Can I show you the roof?
It's magical up there.
Sure.<br/>Ted:<br/>Wait, wait.
Hey, hey, I got<br/>that roof reserved.
Dude, robin's not coming.
Hey, she's going to show up!
She'll show up.
Ted:<br/>She didn't show up.
At least it was a great party.
I ate, like, four<br/>whole cans of dip.
You always know what to say,<br/>old friend.
( Phone ringing )
It's robin.
No, no, not right away...<br/>got to seem casual.
( Ringing continues )
Hello?
I'm so sorry<br/>I missed your party.
Who is this? Meredith?
Robin.
Oh, robin!
Hey! Yeah, I, uh, guess<br/>you never showed up, did you?
No, I got stuck at work.
But, they finally got that kid<br/>out of the crane machine.
Did he get to keep<br/>the purple giraffe?
Yeah, they let him keep<br/>all the toys.
He was in there a long time,
And little kids<br/>have small bladders.
( Chuckles )<br/>robin:<br/>I wish your party
Was tonight.
It is... the party's tonight.
Yeah, uh...
It's a two-day party,<br/>'cause that's just how we roll.
Uh, so, if you want to swing by,<br/>you know, it's casual.
See ya.
So, that was robin.<br/>What are you
Doing to me, man?!
I got a paper to write!<br/>I know! Sorry!
It's terrible!
I'll buy more dip!<br/>Ted! Ted, wait!
Get french onion!
Can you believe this guy?
I got a paper to write.
Okay, fine.
But, it's got to be,<br/>like, super-quick,
And no cuddling after.
I'm the luckiest girl alive.
You were so right<br/>about the roof!
The roof!
The roof is on fire, ted!
That girl from last night...
I took her back to my place,
Spun her around a<br/>couple times and<br/>sent her walking.
She will never find her way<br/>back, and there she is.
How did she get here?<br/>Did you invite her?
I have no idea who that is.
She said she works<br/>with carlos.<br/>Who's carlos?
I don't know any carlos.
( Frustrated groan)
Hi, you!
You're back!
I sure am.
Mmm.
Come on, sweetie,<br/>I need a drink.
"Sweetie"? Really?
( Barely audible ):<br/>Help.
Whoa! Whoa, rabbits!
Come on,
I got that roof reserved.
All right.
So, it's over between me<br/>and works-with-carlos girl.
Whoa! That was fast.
Yeah. I was<br/>trying to think,
What's the quickest<br/>way to get rid of a<br/>girl you just met?
I think I'm in love with you.
What?!
Thanks, bro.<br/>Glad I could help.
What the...<br/>No, no, no. Come on.
Sorry, ted.
Great. What am I going to<br/>do when robin shows up?
She'll show up.
She didn't show up.
All right.
We threw two parties.
Everybody had fun.
Everybody wanged,<br/>everybody chunged.
Now, the kid has<br/>got to get to work,
And the kid is not<br/>to be disturbed.
Repeat after me.
I will not have sex<br/>with marshall.
Both:<br/>I will not have sex<br/>with marshall.
( Phone ringing )
It's robin.
Hello?
Hi, ted.<br/>Amanda?
Oh, denise!
Sorry, you totally sounded<br/>like amanda.
It's robin.
Oh, robin.
Hi.
I totally wanted to come.
I got stuck at work again.
I feel like I live there.
I'm sorry I missed your party,<br/>again.
Hey, ain't no thing<br/>but a chicken wing, mamacita.
Who am I?
I guess there's no chance<br/>your two-dayer
Turned into a three-dayer?
It did, indeed.
The party continues tonight.
Yeah.
Uh, last night,<br/>people were like,<br/>"keep it going, bro.
Party trifecta."
Wow!
Okay, well, I'll be there.
Great!
See you tonight.
So, that was robin.
So, I threw a third party<br/>for robin...
On a Sunday night.
Well, this is lame.
Lame... Or casual?
Lame.
Or casual?
Hey, law books.
Ready for a little<br/>15 minute recess?
Sorry, baby, I got to work.
I need all my blood up here.
Has anybody seen an<br/>introduction to contract tort
And restitution statutes<br/>from 1865-1923?
Anybody seen a big-ass book?
All ( muttering ):<br/>No.
Woman:<br/>Hello, barney.
Of course.
You look well.
Is it weird they invited<br/>both of us?
Who?
Who invited you?
No one even knows who you are!
I understand you're hurt,<br/>but you don't have to be cruel.
Carlos was right about you.
Who is carlos?!
Hey, where the hell is my...?
Oh...!
Okay...
An introduction to contract tort
And restitution statutes<br/>from 1865-1923
Is not a coaster!
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law<br/>career so you can throw not one,
Not two, but three parties<br/>for some girl that you just met
Who's probably not even going<br/>to show up!
I mean, where is she, ted, huh?
Where's robin?
Hi.
Hi, robin.
Wow.
So, you threw all these parties<br/>for me?
No.
Oh, you thought that...<br/>No!
I... Okay, yes.
You got me.
One of the reasons<br/>I threw these parties
Was so that<br/>I could introduce you
To, um, this guy.
Uh, I figured, you know,
Since it didn't work out<br/>between us
And now we can<br/>just laugh about it...
( laughs weakly)
Anyway, robin, this is...
Carlos.
Oh!<br/>Oh!
She's still talking to carlos.
I can still win this.
I-it's not over.
Okay, buddy.
Time for the tough talk.
Robin seems great,<br/>but let's look at the facts.
You want to get married.
And right now,
There's a million women<br/>in new york
Looking for exactly you.
But robin ain't one of them.
She's not just one of them.
She's the one.
Yeah, well, the one<br/>is heading up to the roof.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
It's a game.
I got to just keep playing it.
( Rock music playing )
Ted...
Hey, carlos, can you<br/>give us a minute?
Hey, no sweat, hombre.
See ya.
Robin...
Look, I didn't throw this party
To set you up with carlos,
Or the one before that,<br/>or the one before that.
I threw these parties<br/>because I wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.
There's something here,<br/>look, unless I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I don't know, ted.
I mean, we barely<br/>know each other
And you're looking at me<br/>with that look.
And, it's like...
Like, "let's fall in love<br/>and get married
And have kids and drive them<br/>to soccer practice."
I'm not going<br/>to force sports on them
Unless they're interested.
( Iaughing )
It's a great look.
But you're looking<br/>at the wrong girl.
No, I'm not.
I don't want to get married<br/>right now, maybe ever.
I'd feel like I'd either have<br/>to marry you
Or break your heart, and...
I just couldn't do<br/>either of those things.
Just like you can't turn off<br/>the way you feel.
Click.
Off. Let's make out.
What?
What? That was<br/>the off switch.
And I turned it off.
I mean, look, sure, yes,
I want to fall in love, get<br/>married, blah, blah, blah.
But, on the other hand...
You, me, the roof.
There's no off switch.
There is an off switch.
And it's off.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Yes... It is.
No, it's not.
You're right.
There's no off switch.
God, I wish there<br/>was an off switch!
Me, too.
( Both laughing )
( both muttering nervously )
What do we do now?
We could be friends.
Oh...
I know it sounds insincere<br/>when people say that,
But... We could.
I don't know, robin.
I've made such a jackass<br/>of myself here.
We start hanging out,<br/>every time I see you
It'll be like,<br/>"oh, that's right.
I'm a jackass."
You're not a jackass.
Look, I'm sorry.
I only moved here in April<br/>and I'm always working
And I just haven't met<br/>a lot of good people so far.
But I understand.
Well, uh, maybe in a few months,
After it's not so fresh,
We could all, uh,<br/>you know, get a beer.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
I'll see you, ted.
Or, you know, now.
We could all get a beer now.
I'd like that.
My friends are going<br/>to love you...
Like you, you know, as a friend.
Jackass.
Unbelievable.
That's just a recipe
For disaster.<br/>They work together!
Are you jealous?
Oh, please.
What does carlos have<br/>that I don't?
A date tonight.
All:<br/>Oh!
Stop the tape.<br/>Rewind.
( Imitates tape rewinding )<br/>a date tonight.
All:<br/>Oh!
I'm not sure I like her.
Hey, don't you have a paper<br/>to write?
Dude, you're talking to the kid.
I'm going to knock back<br/>this beer.
I'm going to knock back<br/>one more beer.
I'm going to write<br/>a 25-page paper.
I'm going to hand it in<br/>and I'm going to get an "a."
My name is rufus<br/>and that's the trufus.
( Iaughter )
Ted:<br/>He got a b-minus.
But still,<br/>25 pages in one night, b-minus?
The kid was good.
At least let me buy you a beer.
Come on,
I'll buy everyone a beer.
I'll help carry.
You know something,<br/>ted?<br/>What?
You are a catch.
You're going to make<br/>some girl very happy.
And I am going<br/>to help you find her.
Well, good luck.
I mean, maybe new york's<br/>just too big a town.
I mean, there's millions<br/>of people in this city.
How, in all this mess,
Is a guy supposed to find<br/>the love of his life?
I mean, where do you even begin?
Hi.
Have you met ted?
( Music rises over dialogue )
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>So there was this one night<br/>before I met your mother,
When I really wanted<br/>to go to the bar.
The bar...<br/>Big surprise.
You sure spent<br/>a lot of time in bars.
Ted:<br/>Well, that's just<br/>we did back then.
Me, marshall and lily,
Barney,
We all used to hang out<br/>at this one bar
Called mcclaren's.
But then, one night...
Why don't we go to mcclaren's?
Let's go to mcclaren's.
You guys talking to each other?
Nobody's listening?
What's wrong with mcclaren's?
Mcclaren's is bore-snore.
Ted, tonight<br/>we're going to go out.
We're going to meet some ladies.
It's going to be legendary.
Phone five.
Ted:<br/>I had no idea why I hung out<br/>with barney.
You didn't phone five, did you?
I know when you don't<br/>phone five, ted.
Come on. We always<br/>to go to mcclaren's.
Yeah, 'cause mcclaren's is fun.
Mcclaren's is this much fun.
What I'm offering is the chance<br/>to have... This much fun.
See, you say that.
You say it's going to be<br/>this much fun,
But most of the time it ends up<br/>being this much fun.
This much fun is good.
It's safe. It's guaranteed.
This hand gesture thing
Doesn't really<br/>work on the phone, does it?
No, it doesn't.
( Tires squealing )
Get in the cab.
Marshall, you, too.
I think lily and I<br/>are just going to...
I understand.<br/>Get in the cab.
Why can marshall say no?
Uh, because he's getting laid.
Consistently.
Ted, ted, ted...
You keep going to the same bar.
You're in a rut.
And I am a rut-buster.
I'm going to bust your rut.
It's not a rut, okay?
It's a routine, and I like it.
Ted, what's the first syllable<br/>in "rut-tine"?
Peace out, suckers.
All right, so what's<br/>this legendary plan?
First we've got to pick<br/>someone up at the airport.
Okay, I'm out of here.<br/>Estaban, doors.
( Doors locking )
Okay, we just do<br/>this one little thing,
And the rest<br/>of the night is ours.
Why do you have those suitcases,
And who are we picking up?
I don't know.<br/>Maybe her.
Or her.
( Chuckles )
Wait, so when you said<br/>you were going
To pick someone up<br/>at the airport,
You meant you were going<br/>to "pick someone up"
At the airport?
Scenario:
A couple of girls fly into town
Looking for a fun<br/>weekend in nyc,
When the meet
Two handsome<br/>international<br/>businessmen
Just back from<br/>a lucrative trip<br/>to japan.
Sample dialogue:
"you have a wheelie bag?
Well, I have<br/>a wheelie bag."
You've got to be kidding me.
False.
Sidebar... Tuck in your shirt.
You look sketchy.
I'm sketchy?
Trust me, it's going<br/>to be legendary.
Don't say "legendary," okay?
You're too liberal<br/>with the word "legendary."
We're building an igloo<br/>in central park.
It's going to be legendary.
Snowsuit up!
Ted, ted, ted...<br/>Right here.
This is happening.
Now you can either put the<br/>bags on the carousel now,
Or you can listen to me give you
A really long speech
Convincing you to put<br/>the bags on the carousel.
Your move.
Ted, since the dawn of time...
Mankind has struggled...
That night, marshall had<br/>a ton of studying to do.
So lily went out with robin...
Who was new to new york<br/>and looking for a friend.
I'm so glad we finally get<br/>to hang out, just the two of us.<br/>Yeah.
You sure you're okay giving up<br/>your Friday night
To hang with an old,<br/>almost married lady?
Oh, please.
I'm so sick of the<br/>meat market scene.
Guys are like the subway.
You miss one, another one<br/>comes along in five minutes.
Unless it's the end of the night<br/>and then you get on anything.
Hey-oh!
Compliments of that guy.
Really?
Sweet.
Oh, for you it's $6.
Oh, yes, that's one drawback<br/>to being engaged.
I'm sure that's why he didn't...
Hey.
Oh, hello.
So, uh... Did you just<br/>get in from detroit?
Japan.
Okay, carousel 4 is tapped out.
Ready? Because I'm about<br/>to drop some knowledge.
Cute girls are not from buffalo.
Time-out, 10:00.
You ready to rock this, tedder?
All right, I think we need
To refine our<br/>back story first.<br/>How did we...?
Ted, you klutzy great guy you.
Hey, I'm barney.
Hi.<br/>My god, are you okay?
I am so sorry.
It's fine. No, you were<br/>shaky on your landing.
I give you a 9.2.
Ooh.
Hi. I'm ted.
Look, I'm really sorry<br/>that we have to hit and run,
But we've got a plane to catch.
Where you headed?<br/>Philadelphia.
Philly? That's where<br/>we're headed.
You are?
Well, then we'll<br/>see you on the plane.
Yes, you will.
Follow them.<br/>Ticket's on me.
No. Barney!
Don't you get on that escalator!
And don't you dare get<br/>on that subsequent escalator!

So what brings<br/>you guys to philly?
We're visiting our boyfriends.
I think hers is going<br/>to propose this weekend.
Isn't that great?
So great.
So there we were:
Stuck on an airplane<br/>to philadelphia
With two very un-single girls,
All thanks to your uncle barney.
Aren't they cute?
They're both linebackers<br/>for the eagles.
( Coughs) both?
Both of their boyfriends
Are linebackers.
You're going to philly?<br/>Why?
( Clearing throat )
I didn't ask.
Well, it's sounds like you're<br/>having a lot more fun than I am.
I'm just talking to guys backs
While they hit on robin.
Yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.
Don't you bet I get that a lot?
Not with a ring on your finger.
I mean, you know,<br/>guys see the ring,
It's like ka-chong,<br/>marshall parking only.
Oh, of course.
That's it, the ring.
I guess I'm not used to it yet.
Oh, it's totally the ring.
If you took that ring<br/>off your finger,
You'd have a ton of guys<br/>crowding your junk.
I'm not gonna take off my ring.
Wouldn't you be jealous
Of guys swarming<br/>all over my beeswax?
Oh, yeah, you know me...
I'm the jealous type.

But we're on an adventure.
We're on a tarmac<br/>in philadelphia.
Crazy...<br/>Adventure.
Fine.
No! No!
The night has just started.
Look, airport bar.
Flight attendants.
They'll get your tray table<br/>in its full upright position.
Say what?!
Passengers mosby and stenson,<br/>please come with us, gentlemen.
Keep your hands<br/>where I can see them.
Barney, I am going to kill you.
Don't say<br/>you're gonna kill someone
In front of airport security.
Not cool, not cool.
This is an outrage!
We are international businessmen
On very important<br/>international<br/>business trip.
I demand you release<br/>us immediately!
You demand?!<br/>No, no, no, no, no.
He does not demand.
We-we-we-we have no demands.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you<br/>to remain calm.
Okay. Yeah, I'm calm.
I'm totally calm.
We've got footage of you<br/>placing two bags
On jfk carousel 3,
And abandoning them
To purchase a last-minute flight<br/>with cash.
Those bags were your<br/>responsibility.
They were your bags!
Sir, please.
We're assessing
The bag situation.
( Crackling whirring )
Look, this is all just...
It's a misunderstanding.
Please.
We are international<br/>businessmen.
My colleague accidentally<br/>left the bags there.
Now, please let us go
Before we miss<br/>our international<br/>business meeting.
Can't remember the last time
I saw an international<br/>businessman
With an untucked shirt.
In addition, we received
This footage<br/>taken over the<br/>last few months.
Believe it or not, that<br/>duffel bag thing worked.
The truth is, my friend...
He does this thing<br/>where he goes to airports
With fake luggage<br/>to pick up girls,
And we followed some here<br/>to philadelphia.
That-that-that's it.<br/>That's all this is.
Nobody's that lame.
Yes, he's that lame.
Tell him you're that lame.
We are international<br/>businessmen.
Oh, come on!
Sir, lower your voice, or I will
Restrain you.
Dude, seriously, relax.
We at least get<br/>to call our lawyer.
Exactly!
We have a lawyer?
Listen to me...<br/>you're both american citizens.
Don't let him pull<br/>any patriot act voodoo.
You both retain the right
To refuse<br/>to answer any questions
So don't say anything<br/>until I get there, all right?
Okay. Good-bye.
♪ Philly!
♪ The adventure continues
♪ destroy!
It's ridiculous in here.
Why don't we go somewhere else?
No, this place is great.
What are you doing?
What?
With your lips and everything?
My lips are always like this.
You had to play the race card.
Oh, relax, ted.
We didn't do anything wrong.
And, b.T.W., we'd be<br/>out of here by now
If you had tucked in your shirt.
Go ahead, jfk.
What is the baggage status?
They're clean.
It's just a whole bunch<br/>of condoms.
And a powerbar.
You're free to go.
Ted:<br/>Don't come to philly.
Man, I'm almost halfway there.
Yeah, we just got released
And we're heading back<br/>on the next flight.
Uh, meet us at mcclaren's.
Maybe we can still make<br/>last call.
Can't we just, just...
No, we can't just.<br/>We're going home.
We're going to sasha's.
Who the hell is sasha?
Sasha.
She's having friends over<br/>for drinks at her house.
It's gonna be legen...<br/>Wait for it...
And I hope you're not<br/>lactose-intolerant
'cause the second half<br/>of that word is... Dary!
No.
Legendary.
Legendary. That sounds awesome.
No, marshall, we're going back.
Fine.<br/>Hold on. I have another call.
( Beep)
Hello?
Marshall, we're<br/>going to sasha's.
No, we're not.
Ted, ted, ted.<br/>Right here.
Yes, we are.
( Beep)
Sorry, buddy...<br/>two against one.
Ooh, look, a booth opened up.
Really?
Yeah, I thought we could
Finally go talk...<br/>And you're not
Listening to me, so I'm<br/>going to walk away.
Yeah, yeah, booth.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm engaged.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I took my ring off.
It's very, very sweet of you
To come over and talk to me,<br/>but I just...
Yeah, I'm gay.
I just came over to let you know
That you sat on a grape.
Oh, damn it.
Ted:<br/>So barney and I hit the town.
Philadelphia, pa.
Our first and only stop:<br/>Sasha's party.
( tv blaring )
So, uh...
You're sasha's friends, huh?
You know it.
( Whispering):<br/>You guys, keep<br/>the volume down.
You're gonna wake my grandpa.
Who wants hard lemonade?
Philly!
Shh!<br/>( softly):<br/>Philly.
Back at the bar,<br/>girls' night out
Wasn't going as robin had hoped.
( cell phone ringing )
Lily's phone.
Robin, uh, where's lily?
She's, uh...
Is she talking to some hot guy?
Oh, you can tell me.
It's totally cool.<br/>It was my idea.
Hell, I told her<br/>she could take the ring off.
Really?
Well, I thought<br/>it was kind of weird,
But if you're cool with it,<br/>yeah, uh, it's off,
And she's talking to some guy.
Do you want me to go over and...
No, don't interrupt.
It's awesome.
So, the ring's really off, huh?
It's awesome.
Well, just tell her I called.
And tell her that<br/>she is... Awesome.
♪ Really, really awesome
( weakly ):<br/>♪ our relationship<br/>is built on mutual trust ♪
I can't breathe.
( Iaughing )
You hear that, ted?
Dana works security<br/>at the liberty bell.
I do okay.
Wow, it must be really well<br/>cordoned off over there.
Do you ever go behind<br/>the rope and touch it?
Only all the time.
You ever, like, stick<br/>your head inside it?
Yeah.
You ever lick it?
Nope.
I have never licked it.
Hmm.
I bet nobody in history has<br/>ever licked the liberty bell.
If someone were<br/>to pull that off,
I dare say it would be...<br/>What's the word?
Well, this is my stop.
Legendary.
Ted, legendary.
Barney, I'm going<br/>to the airport.
Sasha, thank you, and, uh,
Tell your grandpa I'm sorry
I walked in on him<br/>in the bathroom.
I'll get some club soda<br/>for that stain.
Lily, I thought tonight<br/>was about us hanging out.
Just fending off the advances<br/>of that totally hot guy.
Dude, I think that guy is gay.
Oh, I know that guy is gay.
It's just, marshall and I have<br/>been together for nine years.
I haven't been single<br/>since high school.
You want to be single?
You want to fight off<br/>loser guys all night?
Does that seem like fun to you?
I guess I just wanted to throw<br/>this net back into the ocean
And see how many fish<br/>I could catch.
So far, one.
One gay dolphin.
And marshall.
Lily, all these<br/>girls here tonight
Are all hoping to catch<br/>what you've already got.
You're right. I know.
Hey, do you want<br/>to go get coffee
And have an actual conversation?
If by "coffee"<br/>you mean "cheesecake," then yes.
Hey, I got that club soda.
Let's see that booty.
Oh, thank you so much.
You want to mess, pal?
That's my fiancée's hot backside<br/>that you're dabbing.
Marshall, no.
Baby, please, don't ever<br/>take that ring off again,
No matter how awesome<br/>I say that it is.
It's okay, man...<br/>Back off, hombre!
I'm not that afraid<br/>to fight you.
You want to test
This guy, be my guest, come on.
Marshall, he's gay.
Oh, thank god. I've never<br/>been in a fight before.
You don't say.
Ted:<br/>So, it turned out
Uncle marshall<br/>really was the jealous type.
Unfortunately,<br/>that guy's boyfriend...
Also the jealous type.
Hey!
Could have licked<br/>the liberty bell.
We're going to the airport.
Bong...
Bong... Bo...
Why do I hang out<br/>with you? Why?
All I wanted was<br/>to have a regular beer
At my regular bar<br/>with my regular friends
In my regular city.
Ted, ted, ted.
You're not even looking.
No, I'm not.
Look, our forefathers died for<br/>the pursuit of happiness, okay?
Not for the sit around<br/>and wait of happiness.
Now, if you want,
You can go to the same bar,<br/>drink the same beer,
Talk to the same people<br/>every day,
Or you can lick<br/>the liberty bell.
You can grab life by the crack<br/>and lick the crap out of it.
That was beautiful, man.
Thanks, leonard.
Ted, you're missing out<br/>on a valuable life lesson here.
Look, I don't need you<br/>to teach me how to live, okay?
I know how to live.
If you want to go<br/>lick the liberty bell,
Just go lick it yourself.
No, it has to be the two of us.
Why? Why do you<br/>need me?
Because you're<br/>my best friend, all right?
You don't have<br/>to tell me I'm yours,
But the way I see it,<br/>we're a team.
Without you, I'm...
I'm just the dynamic uno.
So, fine, if you<br/>want to go home,
Then we'll go home.
( Sighs )
Fine.
We'll go lick the liberty bell.
Good 'cause we're here.
I had no idea how barney
Redirected the cab<br/>without me knowing,
And by god,<br/>we licked the liberty bell.
You know what it tastes like?
What?
Freedom.
No, actually, it tastes<br/>like pennies.
Oh, my god.
Did you guys really do that?
We really did.
And that was when I realized<br/>why I hung out with barney.
I never got where I thought<br/>I wanted to go,
So, that girl<br/>you were talking to...
That was mom?
Kids, every story<br/>in a man's life
Is like a dot<br/>in an impressionist painting...
So that's a no?
Yeah, that's a no.
( Kids sighing)<br/>what?! Come on...!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Kids, when you're single
All you're looking for<br/>is happily ever after.
But only one of your stories<br/>can end that way.
The rest end<br/>with someone getting hurt.
This is one of those stories,<br/>and it starts with a shirt.
A shirt?
Ted:<br/>Just listen,
Because none<br/>of this would have happened
If it hadn't been<br/>for that shirt.
Whoa.
Nice shirt.
Right? Right?
Look at those colors.
Green and brown,<br/>together at last.
Hot top, bro!<br/>Is it new?
That's the crazy part.
I've had this shirt<br/>for, like, six years.
Until this morning,<br/>I wasn't into it at all,
But now, it's like<br/>my tastes have changed.
Booger.
Yes, hello, barney.
Robin:<br/>Barney's offered me
50 bucks to say some stupid word<br/>on a live news report.
Not some stupid word. "booger."
But I'm not doing it.
I am a journalist.
What?! Journalist?!
You do the little fluff pieces<br/>at the end of the news.
Old people. Babies. Monkeys.
That's not journalism.
That's just...<br/>Things in a diaper.
For your information, my boss<br/>is about to bump me up to...
The city hall beat.
City hall? Miss thing.
So I'm not going<br/>to jeopardize my promotion
By saying "booger" for 50 bucks.
Of course not.
'Cause now<br/>you're saying "nipple,"
And it's a hundred.
Step into my web.
Mmm!
Whose bourbon is this?
Ooh, I don't know.<br/>It was here when we sat down.
Gahhh...
The point is...
I seem to like bourbon now.
I could've sworn<br/>I hated bourbon.
First the shirt, now bourbon.
I spent 27 years making up<br/>my mind about things, right?
The movie I saw once and hated;
The city I'll never go back to
'cause it was raining<br/>the day I visited.
Maybe it's time to start<br/>forming some second impressions.
You're finally gonna<br/>watch goonies again?
"Sloth love chunk."
Not goonies. Girls.
What if there's<br/>someone from my past
Who I thought was wrong<br/>for me at the time,
When in fact she,<br/>like this shirt,
Is actually a perfect fit?
Hold up.<br/>There are only two reasons
To ever date a girl<br/>you've already dated:
Breast... Implants.
You know, this isn't a bad idea.
Let's think...
Ted's greatest hits.
What about that girl steph?
Steph...
Okay, this is difficult to say:
Back when I lived
In I.A., I was pretty broke,
So I spent a month<br/>making adult films.
Wow. Okay...
How... How many did you make?
175.
Say what you will<br/>about the porn industry,
They're hard workers.
What about that<br/>chick, um... Jackie?
And my bathing suit
Had fallen completely off.
( Both laughing )
I know the feeling.<br/>Once,
When I was 16, I was driving,
And I hit this hitchhiker.
Don't know what
Happened to him...<br/>just kept driving.
( Iaughing )
Uh... No.
What about natalie?
All:<br/>Natalie...
Who's natalie?
Natalie.
I had so many<br/>fond memories of her:
The tea candles on her dresser,
The sock monkey collection<br/>on her bed,
That one belle &amp; sebastian<br/>song she always listened to,
Her smile...
Man, I haven't seen her<br/>in, like, three years.
Well, why'd you guys break up?
I just wasn't looking for<br/>a big commitment at the time.
Of course, now a big commitment<br/>doesn't seem so bad.
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?
You dumped a porn star?
Friendship over.
Friendship over!
( Knocking at door )
Come in!<br/>All right,
Get back to me, then.
You wanted to see me, mr. Adams.
Yes, I did.
I need you to cover a story.
It's down at city hall.
City hall?
Oh, my god.
( Exhilarated sigh )
So, next time you're<br/>passing city hall,
Make sure and stop by new<br/>york's oldest hot dog cart.
Today, a delicious hot<br/>dog will cost you $2.50.
But, back when the stand<br/>first opened, in 1955,
You could get one<br/>for only a nipple.
Reporting live, robin trubotsky,
Metro news 1.
I said "nipple" on the news.
That was so unprofessional!
I said "nipple" on the news!
At least it's<br/>better than "booger."
( laughs )
Booger.
( Knocking) there she is.
Hey, is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kinda see<br/>robin's nickels.
( Chuckling )
Now, for your next challenge...
There is not going<br/>to be another challenge.
I don't care how much<br/>you offer me.
Oh, search your soul, robin.
You and I both know<br/>this wasn't about the money.
Sure, metro news 1<br/>pays you jack,
And, hey, a little<br/>green salad on the side
Is good for you, me,<br/>and mr. Mcgee.
Seriously, who talks like that?
What baby really likes
Is the thrill<br/>of pulling one over
On those bean counters<br/>who underappreciate you,
And still haven't promoted you,
And so, for two<br/>more hundie sticks,
Baby's going to look in<br/>the camera and say this.
Eww!
I'm just assuming.
I gotta go back to work.
See ya.<br/>Bye.
Baby's gonna think about it.
( Clicks tongue )
Found it!
I found natalie's number.
Hey, ted! Nice shirt!
Is it yesterday already?
I am calling her.
This is crazy.
I haven't talked to her<br/>in, like, three years.
Wonder if she even remembers me.
( Phone ringing )
Hello.
Natalie.
It's ted mosby.
Go to hell.
She remembers me.
Why would natalie
Hang up on you?<br/>I don't know.
Did you sleep with her sister?
No.
Did you sleep with her mom?
No.
I'm losing interest<br/>in your story.
Well, you must<br/>have done something.
Why did you guys break up?
He wasn't ready<br/>for a commitment.
Uh-huh.
And her birthday<br/>might've been coming up.
( Suspiciously ):<br/>Uh-huh...
Okay, so I didn't want to get<br/>a boyfriend-level gift
For a girl I was just about<br/>to break up with.
So you dumped her<br/>right before her birthday?
No, I didn't dump her<br/>right before her birthday.
Uh-oh.
Natalie! Hey.
Happy birthday.
Listen...
( in rhythm):<br/>Never break up with a girl
On her birthday!
Lily, please! The shirt!
I know!
It was a mistake!
Well, did she cry her eyes out?
I don't know.
How do you not...?!
Oh, you didn't.
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday.
Listen...
You're awesome.
You really are.
Awesome.
I'm just like super-busy<br/>right now, so...
Maybe we should just...<br/>Call it a day.
But you're awesome.
On her answering machine!?
Lily, come on.<br/>And on her birthday?!
Oh, who breaks up with somebody
On their answering machine<br/>on their birthday?!
Yeah, dude. E-mail.
Not exactly the point<br/>I was trying to make, marshall.
That is a terrible way<br/>to break up with someone.
Okay, in my client's defense,
Is there an unterrible
Way to break up<br/>with somebody? No.
Personally, I'd rather hear the<br/>bad news on an answering machine
Than face<br/>the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful<br/>way you can do it.
Who are you calling?
Hi, marshall. It's lily.
We're not gonna have sex<br/>for at least a month,
But you're awesome.
Okay, bye-bye.
No, that was
A big mistake, ted.
You should've done it in person.
Thank you.
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me<br/>sex is amazing.
Okay, it was childish<br/>and stupid.
I just... I didn't want<br/>to see her cry.
Well, guess what? She cried.
You just didn't have the sack<br/>to face those tears.
That was me then, okay?
This is the new, old-shirt-<br/>wearing, sack-having ted.
I'm gonna make this right.
You know what else?<br/>"my younger sister
Just got married,<br/>and I'm about to turn 30" sex.
Fantastic.
An occasion that<br/>was supposed to be joyous
Suddenly turned tragic<br/>when ethel and sadie margolis,
New york's oldest twins,
Suddenly passed away on this,
The eve of their 100th birthday.
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.
( Flatly ):<br/>Ow.
Reporting live,<br/>robin trubotsky, metro news 1.
Clear.
Joel adams wants<br/>to see you in his office.
Before you say anything,
I just want to say I really like<br/>working here at metro news 1.
That's great.<br/>So, my dog keeps going
( throaty, high-pitched<br/>growling )
What's...?<br/>What?
You have dogs, right?
What do you think that means?
Take him to the vet?
( Sputters)
Genius.
That's one I owe you.
Was that all?
Yeah.
And nothing<br/>about the twins story?
Oh, yeah, great job on that one.<br/>New york loves you.
You're a superstar. Bye-bye.
That's when robin realized
No one, not even her boss,<br/>watched metro news 1.
( doorbell ringing )
Hi.
( Knocking )
Natalie! Come on!
I just want to say I'm sorry.
I only came down here 'cause<br/>you wouldn't take my call.
Hey, here's an idea...
Why don't you leave a message?
( Forced laugh)
Good one.
Okay, fine, I'm just going<br/>to leave this sock monkey here.
Good-bye.
( Shrieks)<br/>natalie... Okay! Okay!
Look, look, look.<br/>I know you're mad, but...
Happy birthday.
Three years ago.
Oh, yeah?<br/>Up yours three years ago.
Look, look, I was an idiot<br/>leaving that message.
I realize how much that sucked.
No, you don't.
Maybe we should<br/>just call it a day.
But you're awesome.
Okay, bye.
( Weakly ):<br/>Surprise.
There was a surprise party<br/>that night?
How come nobody told me?
People think I can't keep<br/>a secret, but I totally can.
Sorry, not the issue.
Look, natalie, I was just<br/>a stupid kid back then,
Terrified of commitment.
And I suppose<br/>you're suddenly ready
To get married and settle down.
Well, yeah, actually.
I'm a different guy now.
Give me another chance, huh?
You must think I have<br/>absolutely no self-respect.
Come on, just a cup of coffee.
( High-pitched voice):<br/>Please, natalie.
Give the guy a chance.
Self-respect is overrated.
( Acoustic pop song plays )
( sighs)
Wow.
Maybe it was the caffeine,<br/>but you really
Brought your game up<br/>to a whole new level.
Thanks.
I did just start<br/>subscribing to esquire.
They have some helpful columns.
The following is from<br/>the October issue.
So natalie and I<br/>started dating again.
And just like that,<br/>it all came back.
The tea candles...
The sock monkeys...
Belle and sebastian, all of it.
It seemed like happily ever<br/>after wasn't far off.
Well, I better run.
I have my krav maga class<br/>in half an hour.
Krav maga. How cool is it<br/>that she does krav maga?
Thanks, honey.
Mmm!
Bye, guys.
Bye.<br/>Bye.<br/>Take it easy.
Dude, what's krav maga?
I have no idea.<br/>Some kind of yoga?
You know, that natalie,<br/>she's good times.
Yeah, she's, like, the best<br/>girl you've dated in years.
Yeah, ted, hold on to that one.
Yeah.<br/>I have to break up with her.
I don't get it, man.<br/>Natalie's awesome.
I know, she's terrific,<br/>but I have to break up with her.
( In rhythm):<br/>Why couldn't you leave<br/>that poor girl alone?
I know. I hate this.
These past three weeks<br/>have been great.
I should be in love with her,<br/>but I'm not feeling that thing.
It's ineffable.
Ineffable.
Good word.
So when are you going to do it?
She's probably on<br/>the subway by now.
You could call her voice mail:
Beep! "dumped."<br/>click. Done.
No, I have to do this<br/>face-to-face.
I just, I don't know<br/>what I'm going to say.
"I'm not ready<br/>for a commitment."
Oh, that's such a cliché.
It's not a cliché,<br/>it's a classic.
It's the "stairway to heaven"<br/>of breakup lines.
Well, I think natalie<br/>deserves better.
Better. There's no "better"<br/>in breaking up.
There's only "less awful."
A cliché is a cliché<br/>for a reason.
It's comforting.
I already told her I am ready<br/>for a commitment, so...
Oh, my god.<br/>There's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.
No, no, we're gonna<br/>get you out of this.
Okay, how about...<br/>"it's not you, it's me"?
Mm, mm, six words...
"you look fat<br/>in those jeans."
You're free to go.
Ted, have you considered<br/>telling her the truth?
( Iaughing )
Seriously, honey,<br/>men are working here.
Ted, what is the truth?
Why do you want<br/>to break up with her?
The truth?<br/>She's not the one.
So tell her that.
Oh, you can't tell her that.<br/>That's horrible.
Why? What is so<br/>horrible about that?
Yeah, what is so<br/>horrible about that?
She's not the one.
Why is that such<br/>a heartbreaking thing to hear?
The chances of one person being<br/>another person's "the one"
Are like six billion to one.
Yeah, you have better chances<br/>of winning the lottery.
Exactly!<br/>You wouldn't take it personally
If you lost the lottery.
All right, man,<br/>tell her the truth.
She's gonna cry.
Yeah, and he's gonna sit there
And he's gonna<br/>take it like a man.
I have to do the mature thing.
Want to talk mature?
I just wrapped up<br/>a live newscast
By honking my own boobs.
And great tv was had by all.
All right, trubotsky,<br/>new challenge,
And this one's big.
But so is the cash reward.
For $1,000...
You heard me...<br/>all you have to do
Is get up there on the news
And do one of these.
What the hell is that?
Ted, lily, marshall:<br/>The ickey shuffle.
And as you do it, you say this:
"elbert ickey woods,
"the bengals were fools<br/>to cut you in '91.
"Your 1,525 rushing yards
"and your 27 touchdowns<br/>will not be forgotten.
So coach dave shula, screw you<br/>and your crappy steakhouse."
Just write it down for me.
What do I care?<br/>It's not like
Anyone's watching,<br/>anyway, right?
Man, she's gonna cry.
It's the law of love, chunk.
Thanks, lil.
So, the next night, I took<br/>natalie out to dinner...
Look, uh, natalie, there's<br/>something I have to say.
Oh, wait, wait.
There's something<br/>I have to say first.
Today, at work,<br/>I had not one, not two,
But three birthday cakes.
So tonight, can we<br/>just skip the cake?
Today's your birthday?
Yeah. No, it's okay, I wasn't<br/>telling anyone about it.
Today's your birthday!
I...
I didn't get you anything.
Oh, it's okay.
You know, you've already given<br/>me the best present of all.
I can trust again.
You're welcome.
Oh, sir, much more wine.
Henry, as new york's<br/>oldest hansom cab driver,
You've seen quite a lot.
In your past<br/>60 years on the job,
What is your most<br/>exciting memory?
Well...
Ah, this is it.
Oh, boy, here we go.
Everyone, everyone,
If I may direct your attention<br/>to the television.
You are about to see<br/>something amazing.
And then, in '72,
Mickey mantle rode my cab
For the fourth time.
Come on, baby.<br/>Bring it home.
But the most exciting moment...
That would have to be<br/>this one, right now.
What?
Look at me.<br/>I'm on tv.
I never thought I'd<br/>have my story told.
Thank you, miss robin trubotsky.
Thank you.
And right then,<br/>aunt robin realized
How important her job truly was.
It's an honor<br/>to tell your<br/>story, henry.
You know, metro news one
May not be number<br/>one in viewership,
But this reporter<br/>takes pride in...
Whoa! Oh...!
Oh, my god, I'm covered<br/>in horse crap!
Oh, my... It's in my hair.
You planned that?
Ow, my knee! Ow!<br/>No, marshall.
That was beyond<br/>my wildest dreams.
So, if you ever come to alabama,
My mom throws<br/>these huge crawfish boils,
And she's just dying<br/>to meet you, by the way.
Look, natalie, there's<br/>something I have to say,
And, uh, there's<br/>no good way to say it.
I want to break up.
I don't think<br/>you're the one for me.
I don't want to waste your time,
Because I really like you.
I want to do right by you,
And I think the best way for me<br/>to do that is just to be honest.
I'm sorry.
Oh, god, just let it out.
They're only tears.
Aah!
I'm not the one for you?!
I'm sorry, I just...
I-I-I thought the mature<br/>thing to do...
It's my birthday!
Yes, I know.<br/>I didn't realize...
It's my birthday,
And you're telling me<br/>I'm not the one for you?!
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, the odds...<br/>it's like you lost the lottery.
Oh, so dating you is like<br/>winning the lottery?!
No, no, no, no,<br/>I didn't mean that.
Okay, so what's the problem?!
I... I... I can't explain it.
Try!
It's... Ineffable.
I'm not eff able?
No, no, no, no. "ineffable."
"ineffable" means<br/>it can't be explained.
Oh, so I'm stupid?
Oh, god, what's going on?
Okay, what's going on<br/>is you broke my heart
Over my answering machine
On my birthday,
Waited three years<br/>for me to get over you,
Tracked me down, begged me<br/>to go out with you again,
Only so you could dump me
Three weeks later,<br/>again, on my birthday!
No, it's-it's-it's not<br/>like that.
I'm just... It's-it's-it's...
What?!
I'm just, like,<br/>super busy right now.
Remember when natalie said...
I have my krav maga class<br/>in half an hour.
Turns out krav maga<br/>is not a kind of yoga.
It's a form<br/>of guerrilla street fighting
Developed by the israeli army.
( grunts )
This is compliments
Of those two gentlemen<br/>at the bar.
( Mockingly ):<br/>My knee!
It's in my hair!
But isn't it nice to know<br/>people are watching?
Marshall:<br/>Oh, my god.
Are you all right?
Lily:<br/>What happened<br/>to you?
I told the truth.
Turns out the truth has<br/>a mean roundhouse kick.
Oh, man.
Oh, well, you did<br/>the right thing.
I'm proud of you.
I'm bleeding internally.
Hey, ted, you know what always<br/>picks me up when I'm down?
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.
Please,<br/>can we just have one person
In this whole bar<br/>who didn't see it?
( Sighs):<br/>Fine.
Are you okay?
I really thought I was doing it
The good way this time.
I guess there is no good way.
Sometimes,
No matter how hard you<br/>try to do the right thing,
You just end up<br/>flat on your back,
Flailing around in<br/>a big pile of horse crap.
You saw it?
My phone gets the internet now.
( Chuckling)
It's okay...
And that's how<br/>it ended with natalie.
No happily ever after,<br/>just a whole lot of hurt.
And just like that,
All those wonderful memories<br/>were replaced... By this one.
But, you know,<br/>bad as that night was,
Within a year,<br/>natalie was married.
And now she has<br/>three beautiful children.
So that's the upside of hurt.
Sometimes it happens<br/>for a reason.
Wow.
So you got beat up by a girl?
Is that all you're taking away<br/>from this story?
You got beat up by a girl.
Hey, she knew krav maga.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>So, kids, would you like<br/>to hear the story
Of the time I went deaf?
Why does he even ask?
I know, he's just going<br/>to tell us anyway.
I sure am.
Robin strolled into the bar<br/>and said...
Say you're my bitch.
I'm your bitch.
Because tonight I'm getting us<br/>all into okay.
"Okay," awesome!
What's going on?<br/>Did I just have a stroke?
Okay is the name of a club.
Incredibly exclusive.<br/>This friend of mine
Once waited outside<br/>for two hours,
Couldn't get in.
A friend of yours named you?
No, a friend of mine<br/>named shut up.
Yeah, well, the owner goes<br/>to my gym.
It turns out that he is a fan of<br/>my reporting for metro news one.
So now I'm on the list<br/>for tonight.
Nice going, scherbatsky.
You're becoming a long<br/>and difficult-to-spell<br/>household name.
He's even getting me<br/>into the v.I.P. Room.
Yeah, he just wants to show you<br/>his own v.I.P.,
If you know what I mean.
All right, what does v.I.P.<br/>Stand for
In your little universe?
Well, I know that "p" is penis.
Great, so you guys are in.
Should I invite marshal<br/>and lily?
Why was this funny?<br/>I'll explain.
You see, lily was<br/>a kindergarten teacher,
And so one fateful nap time...
Austin and I spent<br/>Saturday night
At the most charming little<br/>bed and breakfast.
It was so nice.
What did you do this weekend?
Go, come on, chug, chug, chug!
Ten seconds!
Suck it, losers!
( Belches )
You know, quiet time<br/>with the fiancé.
Lily:<br/>I don't know,
I just felt embarrassed.
Claire is my age and<br/>she and her husband
Do all this classy<br/>grownup stuff.
Maybe we should start doing<br/>some grownup stuff.
That's some pretty grownup stuff<br/>we did this morning.
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.
Maybe we should have<br/>a wine-tasting party.
I like wine.
I like tasting.
You know I can party.
Let's do it.<br/>Let's rock it.
Maturity style.
And ever since then<br/>she's been signing him up
For book clubs,<br/>cooking classes...
All the things you do<br/>when you know
Where your next thousand lays<br/>are coming from.
So, no, lily and marshall<br/>will not be joining us.
Got it.
Anyway, ted, part two<br/>of my story:
My friend kelly's<br/>going to be there.
Kelly, who supposedly<br/>I'm going to love.
Oh, you are going to love kelly.
She's fun, she's smart,<br/>she lives in the moment...
Translation: She's ugly,
She's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.
Oh, and she's totally hot.
Okay, I guess I could take her<br/>off your hands for an evening.
So do you have any other
Hot, single friends?
No.
Kelly...
( voice trails off)
Oh, no, ted, your blazer!
Somebody spilled gorgeous<br/>all over it.
Love it.
Thank you.
And his hair was perfect.
We're wearing the same shirt.
Oh, wait, no, that's just my<br/>shirt reflected in yours.
One of the 24 similarities<br/>between girls and fish
Is that they're both attracted<br/>to shiny objects.
You really never read<br/>my blog, do you?
All right, tin man,<br/>let's hit it.
All right, well, have fun at<br/>your little disco, guys.
What the hell happened<br/>to these two?
Marshall and I are<br/>just growing up.
Yeah, it's going<br/>to be sweet, too.
Like tonight, we're tasting<br/>all these different wines,
Pairing them up with these<br/>cool gourmet cheeses.
Wow, who knew being in
A committed heterosexual<br/>relationship
Could make a guy so gay?
Ted:<br/>All right, cool kids
Are leaving now.
Grandma, grandpa, don't wait up.
( Techno-pop playing )
My, oh, my.
There are some<br/>ferocious-looking<br/>cutlets here tonight.
All right, hookup strategy.
Colon, find a cutlet,
Lock her in early,
Grind with her all<br/>night till she's mine.
Do these strategies<br/>ever work for you?
The question is:<br/>Do these strategies<br/>ever not work for me?
Either way, the answer is<br/>about half the time.
My bitches!
Check this out.
Um, they're with me.
Um, we're her bitches, too.
We'll wait here.
And with today's<br/>interest rate climate,
You've got to go for
The 30-year fixed mortgage.<br/>Oh, totally.
Yeah.
So, marshall, what about you?
You guys thinking house, baby?
No, I think we're going to wait<br/>on the baby thing.
I mean, I love babies.
Babies rule.
Pudgy arms and stuff...
But, uh, they make you old.
Kind of like this anchor
Weighing you down to one spot...<br/>Forever.
I'm three months pregnant.
Not awkward, guys.
Not awkward unless<br/>we let it be awkward.
This place seems great.
Is kelly here?
Uh, let's go find her.<br/>I'll introduce you guys.
Then I should probably
Duck into the v.I.P. Room.
It's so stupid and arbitrary,<br/>isn't it?
Who gets to be a v.I.P.<br/>And who doesn't?
It's not that arbitrary.
Whoa, this place is loud.
You think?
( Techno-pop playing loudly )
Think it was kind of weird
That ted didn't invite me<br/>out with him?
Why? You'd rather be<br/>out at some dance club,
All noisy and sweaty,<br/>with the...
( imitating drum machine )
Is that what you want?
( Imitating drum machine )
Is this what you want?
"30-year fixed mortgage...
I'm three months pregnant."
That was awkward.
Let's start drinking!
Not so fast.
In order for the tannins<br/>to mellow,
We should let it breathe<br/>for about 30 minutes.
Freaking tannins.
( Techno-pop playing )
Do you know what they're<br/>doing in there right now?
They're watching claire's<br/>ultrasound video.
And I swear to god,<br/>even the baby looks bored.
Come on, it's not that bad.
We're really starting<br/>to click with these guys.
Claire and austin just invited<br/>us to their fondue fest
Next Saturday night.
Are you honestly trying<br/>to get me excited about fondue?
It's dipping stuff in hot<br/>cheese. What's not to love?
Okay, that does sound good.
But it's dipping stuff in hot<br/>cheese with boring people.
Marshall, it's time<br/>for us to grow up.
Marshall knew she was right.
He had to stop<br/>acting like a kid.
But not tonight.
Now, our apartment was<br/>on the third floor,
So I'm not sure if this part<br/>is actually true,
But uncle marshall<br/>swears it happened.
Taxi!
( Techno-pop playing )
The new album is great.
It's all smooth and polished,
Not dark and heavy<br/>like the early stuff.
Oh, yeah, nora jones just gets<br/>better and better.
Please, tell me we can drink<br/>the wine now.
Five more minutes.
We don't want to rush<br/>those tannins.
Freaking tannins.
( Techno-pop playing )
( music stops)<br/>I'm wetting my pants!
( Music resumes )
I think that's when I realized,<br/>clubs weren't awesome.
Clubs weren't even okay.
Clubs sucked.
I had to get out of there.
Hey, robin.
Why aren't you inside?<br/>I'm calling the owner.
There's a guy in there<br/>who won't let me in
To the stupid v.I.P. Room.
Oh, I had this move,<br/>so I came here to bust it.
Can you get me in?
Great. Voice mail.
Thanks, I'll see you!<br/>Bye!
Oh, come on, he just got here.
He's probably famous.
Oh, yeah. Isn't there<br/>a third affleck brother?
Keith affleck or brian<br/>affleck or something?
Holy crap, we just<br/>saw brian affleck.
It's not like I care so much
About getting into<br/>the v.I.P. Room,
I have been in tons<br/>of v.I.P. Rooms.
I'm not exactly a v.I.P.<br/>Room virgin.
But seriously, call me back.
Oh, um, I was just<br/>in there, robin scherbatsky.
I'm on the list.
Name's already crossed off.
Sorry.
But I'm robin scherbatsky.
I'm a reporter for channel one.
There's a channel one?
Back of the line.
Should have snuck in<br/>with brian affleck.
Aah! Coat wench,
Do not uncheck<br/>that man's jacket!
Sorry, just being dramatic.<br/>You're not a coat wench.
No, no, no, coat wench,<br/>I like it.
I should get a sign made up.
What are you doing here?
Lily let you go?
Lily? Who cares, right?
You are so dead.<br/>Oh, I am so dead.
Wow, I'm going home.
No, uh-uh.<br/>I put my ass
And probably other parts<br/>of my body on the line
To come down here<br/>and party with my bro.
Now, damn it,<br/>we're going to party.
All right, one beer.
Yes!
Finally, I don't have to wait<br/>a half an hour for a drink.
Oh, man, I can't believe<br/>I forgot to tell you this.
Earlier that day,<br/>marshall went to the dentist
And got a temporary crown<br/>put in.
Okay, so anyway...
Marshall, are you okay?
Again, I wasn't there, so I'm<br/>a little foggy on the details.
Taxi!
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Marshall just ditched<br/>out on our own party.
Can you get me in there?
I kind of need to kill him.
Actually, I can't<br/>even get myself in.
I was such a dork.
I get recognized one time,
And I start thinking<br/>I'm julia roberts.
I'm no v.I.P.
I'm not even an I.P.
I'm just a lowly little pea,<br/>sitting out here in the gutter.
You know something?
I'd take a pea in the gutter<br/>over julia roberts any day.
Hmm...
( giggling )
( dance music playing)
I broke my tooth!
( In time with music):<br/>Do you have...
( in time with music ):<br/>Maybe there's...
A machine in...
The restroom.
Ted:<br/>Now to this day,
I don't know what<br/>happened in there,
But when marshall came out<br/>a few minutes later...
Rough night?
Yeah.
These clubs are supposed<br/>to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?
Because all of the stuff
You're supposed to like<br/>usually sucks.
Like these clubs... Or cruises.
Or new year's eve.
Or the super bowl.
Or parades.
The rockettes.
Or parades.
You said that already.
I really hate parades.
( Iaughing):<br/>Okay.
He just left in the middle<br/>of our own party!
You don't do that.
Unless, of course, you're<br/>chasing after somebody
Who's already done it,
And then... Then<br/>I think it's okay.
Well, I hate to take his side,<br/>but come on, a wine tasting?
What's the big plan for next<br/>Saturday, scrabble night?
Don't check your e-mail.
Why are you becoming<br/>this person?
I heard that in college
You flashed a campus<br/>tour group on a dare.
Once on a dare.
The other times<br/>were just for fun.
I'm not in college anymore.
I'd love to go back<br/>and be that person again,
But you can't move backwards.
You can only go forword.
Um, false.
You can go wherever you want.
I guess the question is,<br/>where do you want to go?
I want to go into this club<br/>and find my fiancé.
Well, that you can't do.
Want to bet?
Follow my lead.
Hey, big guy.
I said follow my lead.
Please, please.<br/>Follow her lead.
Come on.<br/>Do it, please.
Follow her, please.<br/>Yes, please.
( Gasping)
Those were the four greatest<br/>and only breasts I've ever seen.
Yeah, see, if everyone<br/>keeps telling you
Something is supposed to be fun,<br/>it's usually not.
Right!<br/>Right.
So, by that logic,
If you and I were to say,<br/>go out on a date...
Well, then we<br/>couldn't go anywhere
That's supposed to be fun.
Right. The dmv it is.
Then we'll get<br/>our teeth cleaned.
Sounds awful. It's a date.
Okay!
But there's still<br/>one big question
That needs to be answered.
How many of these coats<br/>do you think
I can put on all at once?
( Iaughing)
( upbeat music blasting )
( no audio)
Okay, for the wedge...
( music pulsating )
Ted:<br/>Barney?
Ted.
Get your coat.<br/>We're leaving.
What... What happened<br/>to that, um...
Cutlet you were grinding with?
That was my cousin leslie.
What?!
No, no, no.
We're not laughing<br/>about this, ted.
This is not gonna<br/>be some funny story
That we'll be telling<br/>in a couple months.
It's not gonna be like,<br/>"hey, ha, remember that time
When you were<br/>grinding with..." no.
And you know why?
Because... italics...<br/>this night did not happen.
You promise me you<br/>will never, ever, ever
Tell another living soul
What transpired here tonight.
You promise.
All right.
Promise.
All right, I promise.
Get marshall and go, okay?
All right.
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll talk to you soon?
Yeah.
Um, hey, tip her, barney.
And even if I did,<br/>on principle, tip<br/>jars have become so...
Funny story: Barney was grinding<br/>with this girl all night...
Fine!
That's a handy new trick.
( Loud disco music playing )
Ted:<br/>So, marshall and lily<br/>rediscovered their youth.
It was nice.
And then it got... Icky.
♪ It isn't so hard to see
♪ we're in heav...
( shouting ):<br/>I'm really glad you<br/>guys came out tonight.
( Shouting ):<br/>You know, dude,<br/>can I just say something?
It kind of hurt that you guys<br/>didn't invite me out.
I mean, I know things have<br/>changed since I got engaged,
But it would have<br/>been nice to be asked!
I'm sorry! I just assumed...
They played some<br/>good songs tonight!
I mean, lately...
I know, I know. It just<br/>seems like suddenly
We're living<br/>in two different worlds.
Maybe you've got more<br/>in common with barney.
What?
Are you crazy?
You think I like<br/>going to those clubs?
I'd so much rather go to your<br/>fruity little wine tasting.
Oh, my god, I'm gonna barf.
Where's my purse?<br/>Where's my purse?
I'm okay.
The problem is, you can't<br/>do any of that couple stuff
Unless you have someone<br/>to do it with,
And the only way I'm gonna<br/>find that someone
Is by going out and doing stupid<br/>single stuff with barney.
What?
But, man, when I find her,
We're gonna have<br/>some bad-ass wine tastings.
It's a plan.
Hey, maybe it'll be<br/>that cute coat check girl.
Yeah!
Maybe it will be.
It wasn't.
You know, ted, I don't say this<br/>nearly enough, but I really...
That place has great salads!
( Techno music fades in )

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Now, as you know, aunt robin<br/>is a big fan of Halloween...
Always dressing up<br/>in crazy costumes...
But she wasn't always that way.
Back in 2005, she thought<br/>she was too cool for<br/>Halloween,
Unlike aunt lily.
Guess what came<br/>in the mail today?
Our costumes?<br/>Do they rule?
They rule.
And yours is 100% wool,
So you won't get hypothermia
Like last year.
Tarzan nipples blue.
You know what I love<br/>about Halloween?
It's the one night of the year
Chicks use to unleash<br/>their inner ho-bag.
If a girl dresses up as a witch,
She's a slutty witch.
If she's a cat,<br/>she's a slutty cat.
If she's a nurse...
Wow, we get it.
She's a slutty nurse.
Robin, what are you doing<br/>for Halloween?
Oh, I don't know.
Probably hanging out with mike,
This guy I've been seeing.
Mike? There's a mike?
You have a boyfriend<br/>and you haven't told us?
No, I mean, he's<br/>not my boyfriend.
He's just this guy<br/>I've been seeing
For a couple of weeks.
( Sing-songy ):<br/>Boyfriend!
So why haven't we met him?
We're not really ready<br/>to go public yet.
( Sing-songy):<br/>Married.
How about we go on a<br/>Halloween double date?
I don't know, we<br/>were kind of thinking
About staying at<br/>home and dressing up
As naked people.
Come on, robin, trot<br/>out your new fella.
Let us judge and evaluate<br/>him behind your back.
It'll be fun.
Hey, ted, you'll never guess<br/>what happened.
Your costumes came?
Our cost... Yes.
That is why we're best friends.
Hey, ted, what are you<br/>doing for Halloween?
Well...
( groaning ) what?
Every Halloween, ted waits
For the slutty pumpkin.
What's the "slutty pumpkin"?
You mean who is<br/>the slutty pumpkin.
It was four years ago...
I was at this Halloween party<br/>up on the roof of our<br/>building.
I'm about to call it<br/>an early night
When out of nowhere<br/>appeared this girl
In the sexiest pumpkin costume.
Wait, how can a pumpkin<br/>costume be sexy?
It was carved<br/>in strategic places.
So, uh, we're at the bar,
And I see her mix kahlua...
Kahlua and root beer.
A cocktail she invented herself.
And she called it...
"the tootsie roll..."
All:<br/>Because it tastes
Like an alcoholic tootsie roll.<br/>Hey!
Can I please tell the story?
So we had<br/>this instant connection.
She gave me her number,<br/>but then...
All:<br/>Something went terribly wrong.
Guys!
Then something went<br/>terribly wrong.
Happy Halloween.
Sonny, where's cher?
Cher?<br/>Right here, babe.
I just met the perfect woman.
She's funny, she's beautiful,
She loves star wars.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>what's her take on ewoks?
Loves 'em.
I don't know why people<br/>are so cynical about ewoks.
The rebellion would have failed<br/>without the ewoks.
And get this:<br/>She's a marine biologist.
She spent a year in antarctica<br/>studying penguins.
Oh, penguins are cool.
Kind of like<br/>black and white ewoks.
I approve.
Hey, where's my,<br/>uh, kit-kat?
I put it right<br/>here on this table.<br/>I don't know,
But we've plenty<br/>of chocolate here.
No, no, you don't understand.
I need that kit-kat...<br/>she wrote her number
On that wrapper. Where is it?
Uh-oh.
Hey, dracula!
Come on, give me the...<br/>Give me it!
Where's the kit-kat?
Where's the kit-kat?!
Never found her number,<br/>never saw her again.
But every year, they have
A Halloween party<br/>up on the roof,
So that's where I'll be.
You know, ted,<br/>it's been four years.
She could be engaged or married,
Or, god forbid, fat.
I don't know,
I got a feeling...<br/>this could be the year.
Halloween is a night<br/>of wonder and magic.
( All groan )
All right, bring the mockery,
Fine, I can take it.
But come on, wouldn't it be<br/>the coolest story ever
If the slutty pumpkin<br/>turned out to be my future wife?
Oh, on the off-chance<br/>that that could happen,
Maybe we should stop calling her<br/>the slutty pumpkin.
That's a really good point.
That's a good idea.
Ted, is your world ready
To be rocked, rocked, rocked?
Can't wait.
So...
What do you think?
So, what do you think?
( Squawks )
Wow.
Marshall, are you wearing<br/>eyeliner?
Oh, yeah.
Weirdly hot, right?
We are so going to win the<br/>costume contest this year.
First prize: $50 gift<br/>certificate at the bar.
And how much did you pay<br/>for your costumes?
$100.
Each.
Well, I think<br/>you guys look great.
What are you going as?<br/>Oh, like I even need to ask.
Hey, I want the slutty pumpkin<br/>to recognize me,
And she knows me as...<br/>A hanging chad.
What? She thought<br/>it was hilarious.
Yeah, four years ago,
But nobody remembers<br/>what the hell a hanging chad is.
What a sad commentary
On our national<br/>attention span...
That we could forget<br/>such a turbulent time
In our political history.
Sad commentary.
( Squawks)
All right,
Polly got to pee.
Again?
Where you going?
It's an elaborate costume.

No, no, not again,<br/>not this year.
You're going as my wingman.
Flight suit up.
No thanks.
I'm sticking with<br/>the hanging chad.
Oh, you're dangerous, maverick.
Your ego's writing checks<br/>your body can't cash.
Okay.
Here's the plan,<br/>and I crap you not.
I'm getting us
Into the victoria's secret<br/>Halloween party.
Trust me, by the end<br/>of the night,
Your chad will not be hanging.
We can get rejected<br/>by supermodels
Any night of the year.
Tonight I'm going<br/>up to the roof,
I'm going to have a few beers,
I'm going to wait for<br/>the slutty pumpkin.
It's just what I do.
Hmm. Victoria's secret models
Prancing around in bras<br/>and panties...
Or yale preppies reuniting<br/>their stupid a capella group.

Heading up to the roof.
Well, boys, looks like<br/>it's just the three of us.
What's that? "self five"?
Nice. We out.
Hey, chad, how's it hanging?
Hey, word play, funny.
Whoo, nice outfit.
I'm a parrot.
You sure are.
Where's mike?
He's meeting me here.
I ran late covering<br/>the Halloween parade
In the village.
There are, like,<br/>a zillion gay pirates this year.
Seriously,<br/>does my eyeliner look okay?
Yes, it's weirdly hot.
So, where's your costume?
( Knocking )<br/>uh, you know,<br/>mike and I joked
About doing something together,
But we decided not to dress up.
Oh, geez.
Hi.
Uh, everyone,
This is michael.
That is not his real hair.
Um, where's your<br/>costume, gretel?
You thought I was...
Oh, I was just kidding.
I've got to stop<br/>making jokes in e-mails.
It's so hard to convey tone.
I think we got them beat.
I can't believe you<br/>talked me into this.
I didn't.<br/>You followed me up here.
This party sucks.
There's seven chicks here.
There's six chicks here.
Relax. The night is young.
It's going to get better.
Ladies and gentlemen,
As on pitch as they were<br/>at spring fling '95,
It's my pleasure to welcome back<br/>the shaggarats.
Crowd ( cheering ):<br/>Whoo!
Whoo!
♪ My bonnie lies<br/>over the ocean ♪
♪ My bonnie lies over the sea ♪
♪ My bonnie lies<br/>over the ocean ♪
♪ Oh, bring back<br/>my bonnie to me ♪
( All giggling)
( mimicking pirate ):<br/>What be a pirate's
Favorite kind of sweater?
Arr-gyle.
Marshall:<br/>And what be
A pirate's favorite<br/>fast food restaurant?
Arr-by's.
'Twould think it<br/>would be arby's.
( Regular voice ):<br/>But, actually, it's<br/>long john silver's.
( All chuckling )
Actually, I kind of<br/>need this hand to eat.
Oh..
( Chuckles)
Oh, yeah.
( Both growl like pirates)
Oh, thank you.
I'm starrr... Ving!
Thank you.
It's so nice to meet you, mike.
You guys are<br/>really cute together.
Yeah, we've been spending<br/>a lot of time together.
We're even getting to that point<br/>where we finish each other's...
This cheeseburger is so...
Good. See?
( Chuckles)
I think you won<br/>the dish-off tonight, baby.
This steak totally<br/>bitch-slapped my pork chops.
Marshall:<br/>That may be true,
But your rice pilaf kicked<br/>my spinach in the crotch
So hard it threw up<br/>a little bit.
( Iaughs)
Marshall:<br/>Mmm... Mmm.
Mmm.
Robin, you have to try<br/>this chicken.
Oh, that's good,<br/>I'm okay, thanks.
It's really tasty.
I'm just really feeling<br/>this cheeseburger.
Mike:<br/>Come on,
Just try a little bite.
Dude, I'm kind of<br/>in the zone here.
Oh, for god's sakes.
Really tasty.
( Sustaining notes in harmony )
( applause and cheering )
Hey.
Hey.
So what does a fella have to do
To get lei'd around here?
Yeah.
Right. 'cause I'm<br/>wearing a lei.
It isn't funny<br/>if you explain the joke.
Let's bail.
No, barney, come on.<br/>I'm having fun.
Plus, it's really great to<br/>see all these guys again.
Name one person you<br/>know at this party.
Well, there's ninja,
Back of horse.
Hey, where's front of horse?
That guy's a riot...<br/>where is he?
Okay, I'm leaving.
But just know,<br/>that this victoria secret party
Is on a yacht.
And what will be sticking<br/>to that yacht?
The "barnacle."
Really?
That's your nickname now?
Yeah, the barnacle.<br/>The barnacle?
That's it.
Barnacle, out.
Have fun, barnacle.
So... Do you like mike?
Do you like mike?
Of course I do. Why?
It just doesn't seem like it.
You won't share your food,<br/>you won't wear a costume.
Oh, lily, you know me.
I'm just not into<br/>all that coupley stuff.
Okay, I know that stuff<br/>looks dumb from the outside,
But it's kind of the<br/>greatest thing in the world
When you're a part of it.
If you just gave it
A chance, you might like it.
Are you trying to get me<br/>to join a cult?
Robin, mike likes you.
If you don't start<br/>meeting him halfway,
You're gonna lose him.
What?
Look, it's Halloween.
Just put on the girlfriend<br/>costume for a night.
Okay, well, what am I<br/>supposed to do,
Buy him a giant teddy bear<br/>or something?
How about you start<br/>by sharing dessert?
I can share dessert.
Good.
He better want<br/>the brownie sundae,
But yeah, yeah,<br/>I can totally share.
Barney?
What, you're back?
That's right.
In a totally new costume.
Every Halloween<br/>I bring a spare costume,
In case I strike out with<br/>the hottest girl at the party.
That way I have a second chance<br/>to make a first impression.
What's with the face?
It's half you're pathetic,<br/>half I have to pee.
So go to the bathroom.<br/>No, there's a huge line.
I don't want to miss<br/>the "slutty pumpkin."
So pee off the roof.
Ooh, ted, pee off the roof.
Whoa, I wouldn't do<br/>that if I were you,
There's people<br/>walking down there.
Come on, ted,<br/>who you gonna listen to?
Me, or mr. Goody-goody<br/>over there?
Yeah, whatever, you<br/>guys got some weed?
A little to the left, marshall.
Robin:<br/>Lily, squat down.
This is gonna be a slaughter.
None of these other costumes<br/>even come close to ourrr... S!
Take the damn<br/>picture. ( squawks )
I still think we should have won<br/>as sonny and cher.
Maybe if I'd worn<br/>the red dress. Huh.
If I could turn back time.
( Gasps )
Oh, wow, this sundae<br/>looks so good.
I could eat the whole thing.
But, um, I would<br/>much rather share
This small, one-scoop<br/>sundae with you, mike.
Apple tart? Excellent<br/>choice, lily-pad.
Thanks, marshmallow.
Well, let's dig in, mi... Mi...<br/>Microwave oven.
Let me guess.
Every guy's used the lei'd line<br/>on you tonight, huh?
You wouldn't believe.
I apologize for my gender.
Let me make it up to you...<br/>make you a drink?
Oh.
You certainly are<br/>a charming devil.
I'm also a "horny" devil.
Yeah.
( Chuckles)
No.
Oh, go to hell.
You know,
If you guys like tiramisu,
We found this little<br/>italian place...
No, you found it.<br/>I came with you.
Go on.
I'm just saying,<br/>we love tiramisu.
I cannot get enough of it.
We're crazy for the stuff.
I'm crazy, and you're crazy...
For tiramisu.
Mike:<br/>Right.
We love tiramisu.
Am I wrong saying that?<br/>No, no, no.
I mean, it just sounds<br/>a little bit weird.
Doesn't it?
We love tiramisu?
Isn't really a group activity.
Loving tiramisu?
Right?
So this italian place,<br/>how is their cannoli?
Robin:<br/>Oh!
Easy there, hungry.
Mmm.
Yeah, looks like we're<br/>both hungry.
( chuckles)
Hey, is that gary oldman?
Wait... Where?
I don't see...
Brain freeze.
Okay, victoria secret party,<br/>right now.
I can't stand watching<br/>my delusional friend
Waste another<br/>precious Halloween.
Ted, the "slutty pumpkin"<br/>is not coming.
She might.
Come on, barney, this<br/>is not about the odds.
It's about believing.
This girl, she...
She represents something to me.
I don't know.
Hope.
Wow.
I did not understand<br/>a word you just said.
Lingerie models on a boat!
See ya.
No. See ya.
( laughs devilishly )
Ow!
Want to drink the melty part?
You know what?
It's getting late.
I think I'm gonna
Take off.
Hey.
I thought we were gonna<br/>follow those bread crumbs
Back to my place, hansel.
Robin, I don't get the sense<br/>you like being with me.
I like being with you.
Not as much as you<br/>like being alone.
You like...
Eating your own food,<br/>sleeping in your own bed,
Doing your own crosswords.
Who uses ink?
Sorry.
Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways,
That doesn't mean<br/>that this won't work.
Actually, it kind of does.
Wait, are we breaking up?
No, we aren't breaking up.
I'm breaking up with you.
Ted:<br/>And then just as I was<br/>about to lose hope...
She spent a year in antarctica<br/>studying penguins.
Kahlua, root beer...
Could this penguin be
The "slutty pumpkin?"
Uh, excuse me.
This is going to sound crazy,
But I met someone<br/>up on this roof four years ago,
And they mixed that cocktail,<br/>and-and they loved penguins.
By any chance, was that you?
It's you.
Everyone thought<br/>I was crazy, but I came...
You are such a loser.
Come on, I came<br/>back for you, ted.
I penguin-suited up
To show you the<br/>error of your ways.
And to score hula girl's number.
Check and check.
Unbelievable.
Yes, it is.
Oh. Wait a minute.
You're that lame army guy.
What? No, no,<br/>that's some other guy,
And he was a kick-ass<br/>fighter pilot.
I cannot believe I<br/>gave you my number.
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.
Yeah. Well, give it back.
Well, uh, I don't think so.
I earned it, fair and square.
I'm calling you.
But I'm never gonna<br/>go out with you.
But how will you know it's me?
I'm a master of disguise.
Yeah.
( Sighs )
Nice.
Come on, ted.
Victoria secret party,<br/>now, let's go.
I'm staying.
( Sighs ):<br/>Fine! Fine...
What are you doing?
I'm flippering you off.
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
Seriously,
It's not a big deal.
He wanted to be a we,<br/>and I wanted to be an I.
Dudes are such chicks.
Hmm.
You guys, I'm fine.
Man:<br/>Ladies and
Gentlemen, the results are in.
And the winners of this year's
Costume contest are...
Lily aldren as a parrot,
And marshall erikson<br/>as a gay pirate!
Oh, yeah!
Wait, what did he say?
Oh, who cares, marshall?<br/>We won!
Wait. Gay pirate...<br/>where are you getting that from?
Dude, you're wearing eyeliner.
Okay.
I just want everybody here<br/>to know I'm not a gay pirate.
I have sex<br/>with my parrot all the time.
That came out wrong.
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter.
We won!
I love you, marshmallow.
I love you, too, lily pad.
You guys, let me get a picture.

♪ I want to know<br/>what it's like ♪
♪ On the inside of love...
I had a feeling<br/>I'd find you here.
Oh, hey.
If you're here<br/>for the shaggarats,
You just missed<br/>the fourth encore.
I never played any team sports.
Are we playing "I never"?
'Cause there's nothing left<br/>but peach schnapps.
I played tennis in high school.
You know why?
Because it was just me<br/>out there.
I couldn't even stand<br/>playing doubles.
I just got dumped.
Oh, man, that sucks.
Yeah. It's okay.
I wasn't that into him.
Story of my life.

Falling in love<br/>and acting stupid and goofy
And sweet and insane,<br/>but not me.
Why don't I

I want to want that.
Am I wired wrong or something?
No.
Look, you didn't want to be<br/>with me,
So, clearly,<br/>you have abysmal taste in men.
( Iaughs )
But you're wired just fine.
Well, what if I'm just a...
A cold person?
Tonight mike was willing to look
Like a complete idiot for me,<br/>but I couldn't be gretel.
Why can't I be gretel?

[<div class="full-script">Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.
That love is not a science.
Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
We're going to go watch TV.
You see, sometimes in life you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained.
And that's kind of scary.
Oh, my God.
I know, I'm still shaking.
What the...?
Joke's on you, I have a cold.
Are you guys okay?
Another round, and back it up for me and Lily!
What happened?
We saw something up in the apartment.
Something bad.
I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.
Oh, muchos sexy.
Yo quiero, Marshall.
Oh, my God.
What was it?
Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.
Mouse?
Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.
Baby, it was a mouse.
It had whiskers.
But those things coming out of its head, those were antennae.
Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
It was a mouse.
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.
Oh, my story is on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.
I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker.
Ellen, your company, Love Solutions, boasts 100% success rate.
What's your secret?
Science.
Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.
All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm,
and presto manifesto, you have a soul mate, and it works!
Just ask all of my happy couples.
And these are just the attractive ones.
I have more photos in the bathroom.
Love Solutions, Ellen Pierce.
A beacon of hope for New York City's lovelorn.
Robin Scherbotsky...
Was that chick at the end really a client?
Yes.
We're signing up.
What?
Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.
I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up.
It's the man version of getting a cat.
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur, and only mammals have fur.
It was a cockroach.
Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach
is if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Ted! Hurry! You've got to help me.
- My boat is sinking!<br/>- What?
- My boat is sinking!<br/>- You have a boat?
Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction.
I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle.
If I don't get down there right now, it's going to capsize. Now come on!
Your boat is sinking. That was good.
Come on, Ted. This is an incredible opportunity.
We'll meet our soul mates, nail 'em and never call 'em again.
All finished, gentlemen?
Congratulations.
You have just taken your very first step.
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.
I'm so done with the single life-- all the games, the meaningless sex.
You deserve more.
That is so true, Ellen.
I really think I'm ready to stop being a me, and start being a we.
Hey, is there any way I can let it be known that I love cuddling?
Ah, of course you can. That is so... Oh.
Kind of hard to talk about with Ted here, but
I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night...
when the tears come.
Ellen, can you help me find her?
Get out.
What?
I get 15 guys like you every week.
Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call 'em again.
Oh, my God, people do that?
Do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?
No, that's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.
Okay, Ted, let's go.
Not you. You stay.
You're cute.
You're an architect.
Good career, and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application,
like your friend Jack Package.
- It's pronounced pa-codge.<br/>- Get out of here!
You, I can work with. You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.
Uh, no thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.
It's New York City, you know-- plenty of fish in the sea.
Plenty of fish in the sea.
Yes, there's nine million people in New York, 4.5 million women.
Of course, you want to meet somebody roughly your own age.
Let's say, plus, minus, five years.
So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000.
But, uh, wait... 48% of those are already in relationships,
and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility,
and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives,
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.
And then that leaves us with eight women.
That can't be right. Eight?
Really? Eight?
There are eight fish in that big blue ocean, Ted.
And if you feel confident that you could reel one in to your boat without me,
there's the door.
Do you take credit cards?
Okay, it's back. And this time we got a good look.
Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.
It's bigger now.
It's been feeding.
We were just upstairs watching TV.
Oh, gosh.
Okay, let's do this.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.
It's over.
Oh, God!
So did you get a good look at it?
Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton, like a roach.
But it had mouse-like characteristics.
Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?
It's a cock-a-mouse.
What?
It's some sort of mutant combination of the two.
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse, you know...
Did the horizontal, ten-legged, interspecies cha-cha?
That's impossible. That simply can't happen.
- Oh, but it can.<br/>- And it has.
And it's pissed.
Dude, is everything okay? You left the front door open.
There was no time.
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?
She said it'd take three days. It's been five days.
Should I be worried?
Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.
Did you just use my name as a verb?
Oh, yeah. We do that behind your back.
"Ted out," to overthink.
Also see "Ted up."
"Ted up"-- to overthink something with disastrous results.
Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when he tried...
Okay, I get it.
Don't worry. I'm not going to Ted anything up. Or out.
I should give it a few more days.
Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
Ted, hi. I, uh, meant to call you.
The computer is still crunching the numbers.
Busy as a bee, that little computer.
You said it was going to be three days.
Did I?
Three days? Really?
Yeah, and when someone says you're going to meet the perfect woman in three days,
you kind of put that in your date book, so...
How do I say this? This is going to be really hard.
Ted... there are absolutely no women out there for you.
Phew, actually, I got through that okay.
There're no women out there for me? I thought you said there were eight.
I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.
But... I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute.
I'm a cute architect.
How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook.
I could maybe find somebody for you if you were gay.
Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?<br/>- No!
You're messing with me, right?
Come see for yourself.
I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher.
And look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6.
There's a 9.6 right there.
Don't touch the computer.
Yes, Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.
Well, what about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?
8.5.
So he sucks.
No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.
Oh, sure, it's good.
It's solid, but a 9.6?
9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up.
Ted, look, I have a lunch.
Please, I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope.
There are new women turning 18 every day.
It's a whole new species-- the cock-a-mouse.
And it's the size of a potato.
So what, now it's a cock-a-potato-mouse?
Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cock-a-mouse.
My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person.
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch, she wants to have two children.
Her guilty pleasure song is "Summer Breeze" by Seals and Crofts.
Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.
And like the majestic seahorse, it's hermaphroditic.
Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.
For as much as we know about the cock-a-mouse,
there's still so much we don't know.
Well, we know that there's no such thing as the cock-a-mouse.
What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.
So you really don't believe in the cock-a-mouse?
Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal,
but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know?
Like the Loch Ness Monster.
If by "like the Loch Ness Monster," you mean totally exists and is awesome,
then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness Monster.
Its diet is not unlike our own-- grains, cereals-- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
Okay, this is getting weird. The similarities go on and on.
She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies, too.
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.
You want to be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend, it's uncanny.
All right.
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?
See what my 9.6 looks like in person?
As, you know, a frame of reference.
And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?
That's right. I did the math.
Hi.
Hi. I'm Dr. O'Brien.
I'm Architect Mosby.
Sorry, I just wanted to say my job, too.
Hi, I'm Ted.
Hi. So what are we doing today?
Right, I, uh, I have a kind of mole on my back.
It's probably nothing, but I'm a cautious guy.
I'm exactly the same.
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Sorry about that.
"Summer Breeze" is my guilty pleasure song.
It's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend...
at brunch.
I love brunch.
It's the best.
As long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.
I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.
Hey, this may sound weird, but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off.
So I'm going to ask you now.
Do you want to have dinner with me Saturday night?
That's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.
Friday night?
Wow. You're getting married. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm really sorry I asked you out, it just felt like
there could be this weird connection between us.
How crazy am I coming off here?
Only a little.
Well... if by some million-to-one long shot and I'm not rooting for this--
you wind up not getting married this weekend,
give me a call.
Okay.
But it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.
I'm sure you do.
Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap.
You think the roadrunner's going to fall for it?
Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.
But Marshall and I, we're believers.
We believe.
Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome.
You've got the Bermuda Triangle, ghosts, Bigfoot.
Bad maps, creaky houses, hillbilly in a gorilla suit.
Aliens.
Oh, come on, you've got to give me aliens.
Stonehenge, Area 51, there's alien crap all over the place.
You can't be serious.
My friend, you just poked the bear.
So my 9.6-- beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.
Oh, Ted. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it was a long shot.
I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mind, but I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not skip over this.
Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.
Come on, Lily. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
"On the night of July 2, 1947, conditions we clear over Roswell, New Mexico..."
Oh, geez.
Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you.
Dr. O'Brien.
What?
"When suddenly an array of..."
Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien.
About today, listen, I really need to talk to you.
Call me. I'll be at the office all day.
The doctor will see you now.
What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.
Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it,
I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.
In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.
Happy ending.
Look, I have to go down there.
I don't know what's going to happen when I get there, but I've got to give it a shot.
All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cock-a-mouse?
Yeah, we're going to go make some crop circles.
Oh, my God!
Holy crap buckets. We got it.
What do we do with it?
Calm down. I have a plan.
I told my friend Sadip about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department.
But it has to be alive.
Wait, no, no!
They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean.
Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?
Hello again.
I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.
Go ahead, Sarah. You can tell me anything.
You have a basal cell carcinoma.
Anything else?
Your mole. The biopsy came back.
It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.
Wait, then you're still getting married?
Of course I'm still getting married.
But we're a 9.6.
Excuse me?
Okay. I went to Love Solutions, and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer,
that you and I are a 9.6.
Your fianc? is only an 8.5.
You looked at my file?
I had to. You're my only match.
Aren't you even a little curious?
The woman who set you up with your fianc?, thinks we're a better match.
I am getting married on Saturday.
Summer breeze...
Ted.
Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive
marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?
Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you
to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?
See? We're both impulsive.
We're perfect for each other.
Ted, just calm down.
Calm down?! You're my only match.
God, there was a computer and there were eight fish in a sea full of lesbians and...
Okay, Ted, Ted.
Do you honestly believe, deep down, that there is no one else out there for you
just because some computer says so?
I didn't used to. But there was math, I got confused.
Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling.
When you fall in love with someone, an 8.5 equals a perfect ten.
You're right.
If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.
Brace yourself, dude.
This is going to blow your mind hole.
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.
What?
It's empty.
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...
Lily.
Robin!
What?
Oh, my God.
It's real.
No, is it?
Do something.
What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?
It was the only thing I could think of.
Lily! Thank God.
Lily, I love you.
Robin, open up the window!
Open the window! Ah!
It can fly.
Wow.
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.
I grew to admire your tenacious... Holy mother of God, it's headed this way!
Hi, Ellen.
I think I want my money back.
I'm a failure.
I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted.
I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program.
Last night I stood out on the street for five hours
showing your photo to random pedestrians. No takers.
Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price
because you kind of look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of ice cream, isn't that a bit clich??
It's for the bourbon.
This isn't hopeless. You're going to find someone for me.
No, I won't.
You're going to die alone.
I'm not going to die alone.
Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive.
You just got to get back out there and keep looking.
No, you're never going to find anybody.
And every year you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.
You're being ridiculous. I'm going to be up on that wall one of these days.
- No, you won't!<br/>- Yes, I will!
How do you know?
I don't know, but I believe.
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, damn it, so can I.
You're losing me.
The point is, something good's going to happen to me.
Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.
So I should keep looking?
Of course you should.
And now, you're going to do it for free.
Oh, Ted. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it was a long shot.
I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mind, but I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not skip over this.
Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.
Come on, Lily. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
"On the night of July 2, 1947, conditions we clear over Roswell, New Mexico..."
Oh, geez.
Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you.
Dr. O'Brien.
What?
"When suddenly an array of..."
Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien.
About today, listen, I really need to talk to you.
Call me. I'll be at the office all day.
The doctor will see you now.
What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.
Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it,
I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.
In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.
Happy ending.
Look, I have to go down there.
I don't know what's going to happen when I get there, but I've got to give it a shot.
All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cock-a-mouse?
Yeah, we're going to go make some crop circles.
Oh, my God!
Holy crap buckets. We got it.
What do we do with it?
Calm down. I have a plan.
I told my friend Sadip about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department.
But it has to be alive.
Wait, no, no!
They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean.
Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?

[<div class="full-script">Kids, before I met your mother,
When I was still<br/>out there searching,
I learned something valuable.
That love is not a science.
Wow, that was<br/>a great story, dad.
You see, sometimes in life<br/>you just have to accept
That certain things<br/>can't be explained.
And that's kind of scary.
Oh, my god.
I know, I'm still shaking.<br/>What the...?
Joke's on you, I have a cold.
Are you guys okay?
Another round, and back it<br/>up for me and lily!
We saw something up<br/>in the apartment.
Something bad.
I don't know what it is,<br/>but margaritas make me sexy.
Oh, muchos sexy.<br/>Yo quiero, marshall.
Oh, my god.
Only the craziest,<br/>meanest looking mouse<br/>you've ever seen.
Mouse?
Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.
Baby, it was a mouse.
But those things coming out of<br/>its head, those were antennae.
Marshall ran away<br/>from a cockroach.
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.<br/>You're a man.
Oh, my story is on.
Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.
I'm here with ellen pierce,
New york's premiere matchmaker.
Ellen, your company,<br/>love solutions,
Boasts 100%<br/>success rate.
What's your secret?
Science.
Can be broken down to ones<br/>and zeros, even love.
All I have to do is<br/>input the variables,
And presto manifesto, you have<br/>a soul mate, and it works!
Just ask all<br/>of my happy couples.
And these are just<br/>the attractive ones.
I have more photos<br/>in the bathroom.
Love solutions, ellen pierce.
A beacon of hope<br/>for new york city's lovelorn.
Robin scherbotsky...
Was that chick at the end<br/>really a client?<br/>Yes.
We're signing up.<br/>What?
Ted, these chicks are<br/>desperate and hot.
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.
I'm not going to a matchmaker.<br/>That's like giving up.
It's the man version<br/>of getting a cat.
No, it wasn't a cockroach.
It had fur, and only<br/>mammals have fur.
It was a cockroach.
Come on, lily, the only way<br/>that that was a cockroach
Is if it was wearing the skin<br/>of a mouse it just killed.
Oh, my god.
Come on.
Ted!
Hurry! You've got to help me.<br/>My boat is sinking!<br/>What?
My boat is sinking!<br/>You have a boat?
Yes, I bought a boat last year<br/>at a police auction.
I just got a call from a guy<br/>down at the marina
If I don't get down there right<br/>now, it's going to capsize.
Now come on!
Your boat is sinking.
That was good.
Come on, ted.
This is an incredible<br/>opportunity.
We'll meet our soul mates,
Nail 'em<br/>and never call 'em again.
All finished, gentlemen?
Congratulations.
You have just taken
Your very first step.
Gosh, thanks, ellen.
I sure hope this works.
I'm so done
With the single life--
All the games,<br/>the meaningless sex.
You deserve more.
That is so true, ellen.
I really think I'm ready<br/>to stop being a me,
And start being a we.
Hey, is there any way<br/>I can let it be known
That I love cuddling?
Ah, of course you can.
That is so...
Oh.
Kind of hard to talk<br/>about with ted here,
But I just want someone<br/>who's not afraid
To hold me at night...
When the tears come.
Ellen, can you help<br/>me find her?
Get out.
What?
I get 15 guys like you<br/>every week.
Jerks who just want
To meet<br/>vulnerable women,
Nail 'em<br/>and never call 'em again.
Oh, my god, people do that?
Do you want to do this<br/>the easy way or the hard way?
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up<br/>and tosses me out?
No, that's the easy way.
The hard way is that I stomp<br/>the crap out of you myself.
Okay, ted, let's go.<br/>Not you. You stay.
You're cute.
You're an architect.
Good career, and you didn't use<br/>an obvious alias
On your application,<br/>like your friend jack package.
It's pronounced pa-codge.
Get out of here!
You I can work with.
You give me three days,
And I will find the woman<br/>you will marry.
Uh, no, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm
To meet women.
It's new york city, you know--<br/>plenty of fish in the sea.
Plenty of fish in the sea.
Yes, there's nine million people<br/>in new york,
4.5 million women.
Of course, you want to meet<br/>somebody roughly your own age.
Let's say, plus, minus,<br/>five years.
So if we take into account<br/>the most recent census data,
That leaves us
With 482,000.
But, uh, wait...
48% of those
Are already in relationships,
And then you have to eliminate<br/>half for intelligence,
Sense of humor<br/>and compatibility,
And then you<br/>have to take out
The ex-girlfriends<br/>and the relatives,
And, oh, we can't forget<br/>those lesbians.
And then
That leaves us with eight women.
That can't be right.<br/>Eight?
There are eight fish<br/>in that big blue ocean, ted.
And if you feel confident<br/>that you could reel one in
To your boat without me,<br/>there's the door.
Do you take credit cards?
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got<br/>a good look.
Hey, seriously,<br/>you have to stop doing that.
It's bigger now.
It's been feeding.
We were just upstairs<br/>watching tv.
Oh, gosh.
Okay, let's do this.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's over.
Oh, god!
So did you get<br/>a good look at it?
Yeah. It has six legs, a hard<br/>exoskeleton, like a roach.
But it had mouse-like<br/>characteristics.
Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.
So which is it:<br/>A cockroach or a mouse?
It's a cock-a-mouse.
It's some sort of mutant<br/>combination of the two.
It's as if a cockroach<br/>and a mouse, you know...
Did the horizontal,<br/>ten-legged, interspecies<br/>cha-cha?
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.
Oh, but it can.
And it has.<br/>And it's pissed.
Dude, is everything okay?<br/>You left the front door open.
There was no time.
So, love solutions?
Did you meet the love<br/>of your life?
She said it'd take three days.<br/>It's been five days.
Should I be worried?
Oh, just play it cool.
Don't ted out about it.
Did you just use my name<br/>as a verb?
Oh, yeah.
We do that behind<br/>your back.
"Ted out:"
To overthink.
Also see "ted up."
"Ted up:" to overthink
Something with<br/>disastrous results.
Sample sentence: Billy<br/>tedded up when he tried...
Okay, I get it.
Don't worry.
I'm not going<br/>to ted anything up. Or out.
I should give it<br/>a few more days.
Hi, ellen. Remember me?<br/>I'm ted.
Ted, hi.
I, uh, meant to call you.
The computer is still<br/>crunching the numbers.
Busy as a bee, that<br/>little computer.
You said it was going<br/>to be three days.
Did I?<br/>Hmm.
Three days? Really?
Yeah, and when someone says<br/>you're going to meet
The perfect woman in three days,
You kind of put that<br/>in your date book, so...
How do I say this?
This is going to be<br/>really hard.
There are absolutely<br/>no women out there for you.
Phew, actually, I got<br/>through that okay.
There are no women<br/>out there for me?
I thought you said<br/>there were eight.
I know. There are<br/>supposed to be.
I don't know where<br/>they are.
But... I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.
I'm a cute architect.
How do you think I feel?
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook.
I could maybe find
Somebody for you<br/>if you were gay.
Well, I'm not.<br/>A little bi maybe?
No!
You're messing with me, right?
Come see for yourself.
I cannot set you up
Unless you have<br/>a compatibility rating
Of 7.0 or higher.
And look: 5.4, 4.8, 5.6.
There's a 9.6 right there.
Don't touch the computer.
Yes, sarah o'brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.
She would have been absolutely<br/>perfect for you.
Well, what about the guy<br/>you set her up with?
Is he a 9.6<br/>compatibility rating?
8.5.
So he sucks.
No, 8.5 is an extremely good<br/>match-up quotient.
Oh, sure, it's good.<br/>It's solid, but a 9.6?
9.6 is off the charts,<br/>but sarah is matched up.
Ted, look, I have a lunch.
Please, I<br/>promise we will
Find you somebody.<br/>Don't lose hope.
There are new women<br/>turning 18 every day.
It's a whole<br/>new species--
The cock-a-mouse.
And it's the size<br/>of a potato.
So what, now it's a<br/>cock-a-potato-mouse?
Don't make it<br/>sound ridiculous.
It's a cock-a-mouse.
My god, this is incredible.<br/>We're like the same person.
Sarah o'brien loves brunch.<br/>She wants to have two children.
Her guilty pleasure song
Is "summer breeze"<br/>by seals and crofts.
Wow, ted, sounds like<br/>you're her perfect woman.
And like<br/>the majestic seahorse,
It's hermaphroditic.
Obviously the whole thing<br/>is shrouded in mystery.
For as much as we know<br/>about the cock-a-mouse,
There's still so much<br/>we don't know.
Well, we know that there's no<br/>such thing as the cock-a-mouse.
What we don't know is what<br/>you guys have been smoking.
So you really don't believe<br/>in the cock-a-mouse?
Well, I believe that you saw<br/>something perfectly normal,
But you've exaggerated it<br/>in your mind, you know?
Like the loch ness monster.
If by "like<br/>the loch ness monster,"
You mean totally exists<br/>and is awesome, then yeah,
It's like the<br/>loch ness monster.
Its diet is not unlike our own--
Grains, cereals-- and<br/>it's awfully fond of cheese.
Okay, this is getting weird.
The similarities go on and on.
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.
She's a dermatologist.
I have skin.
You want to be<br/>her boyfriend.
She already<br/>has a boyfriend.
It's uncanny.
All right.
But it wouldn't hurt<br/>to check her out, right?
See what my 9.6<br/>looks like in person?
As, you know, a<br/>frame of reference.
And if she thinks she<br/>can do 11.45% better,
Who am I<br/>to deny her that?
That's right.
Hi.
Hi. I'm dr. O'brien.
I'm architect mosby.
Sorry, I just wanted<br/>to say my job, too.
Hi, I'm ted.<br/>Hi.
Right, I, uh, I have<br/>a kind of mole on my back.
It's probably nothing,
But I'm a cautious guy.
I'm exactly the same.
♪ summer breeze<br/>makes me feel fine ♪
♪ blowing through the jasmine<br/>in my mind ♪
Sorry about that.
"summer breeze" is<br/>my guilty pleasure song.
It's been stuck in my head
Ever since I heard it<br/>this weekend... At brunch.
I love brunch.
It's the best.
As long as I don't<br/>have to spend it
With a bunch of phonies.
I like the way you think,<br/>architect mosby.
Hey, this may<br/>sound weird,
But it'll definitely sound<br/>more weird once my shirt's off.
So I'm going to ask you now.
Do you want to have dinner<br/>with me Saturday night?
That's very sweet,
But I'm actually getting married<br/>on Saturday.
Friday night?
Wow. You're<br/>getting married.
Congratulations.<br/>Thank you.
I'm really sorry<br/>I asked you out.
It just felt like there could be
This weird connection<br/>between us.
How crazy am I coming off here?
Only a little.
Well...
If by some million-<br/>to-one long shot
And I'm not<br/>rooting for this--
You wind up not getting married<br/>this weekend,
Give me a call.
Okay.
But it's not likely.
I look damn good in my dress.
I'm sure you do.
Wow, that's a pretty<br/>sophisticated trap.
You think the roadrunner's<br/>going to fall for it?
Okay, we get it.<br/>You're skeptical.
But marshall and I,<br/>we're believers.
We believe.
The universe is mysterious<br/>and awesome.
You've got the bermuda triangle,<br/>ghosts, bigfoot.
Bad maps, creaky houses,<br/>hillbilly in a gorilla suit.
Aliens.
Oh, come on,<br/>you've got to give me aliens.
Stonehenge, area 51,
There's alien crap<br/>all over the place.
You can't be serious.
My friend,<br/>you just poked the bear.
So my 9.6--
Beautiful, charming,<br/>intelligent,
Engaged.
Oh, ted.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it was a long shot.
I told her to call me anyway<br/>if she changes her mind,
But I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/>Let's not skip over this.
Raise your hand if earlier today<br/>you hit on an engaged woman.
Come on, lily.<br/>Don't hate the player.
Hate the game.
"on the night of July 2, 1947,
Conditions were clear<br/>over roswell, new mexico..."
Oh, hey, ted, there's a message<br/>on the machine for you.
Dr. O'brien.
What?
"when suddenly an array of..."
Ted, hi, this is dr. O'brien.
About today, listen, I really<br/>need to talk to you.
Call me.<br/>I'll be at the office all day.
The doctor will see you now.
I should totally<br/>go down there, right?
Don't interfere.
Some guy is expecting to marry<br/>this woman on Saturday.
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.
Look, if I was marrying<br/>the wrong person
And the right person was<br/>out there and knew it,
I'd want that person to come<br/>down to my dermatology office
And tell me so.
In that scenario,
I'm not interfering,<br/>I'm a happy ending.
Happy ending.
Look, I have<br/>to go down there.
I don't know what's going<br/>to happen when I get there,
But I've got to<br/>give it a shot.
All right, see you later.
Happy hunting.
Wait, where<br/>are you guys going?
Don't you want to stay<br/>and see the cock-a-mouse?
Yeah, we're going to go<br/>make some crop circles.
Oh, my god!
Holy crap buckets.<br/>We got it.
What do we do with it?<br/>Calm down.
I have a plan.
I told my friend<br/>sudeep about it.
He wants to show it to the<br/>columbia biology department.
But it has to be alive.
Wait, no, no!
They'll do lab<br/>experiments on it.
That's so mean.
Shouldn't we just beat it<br/>to death with a bat?
Hello again.
I would prefer to say this<br/>to you in person.
Go ahead, sarah.
You can tell me anything.
You have<br/>a basal cell carcinoma.
Anything else?
Your mole.
The biopsy came back.
It's not life-threatening,
But we should excise<br/>the rest of it.
Wait, then you're still<br/>getting married?
Of course I'm still<br/>getting married.
But we're a 9.6.
Excuse me?
Okay.
I went to love solutions,<br/>and I saw
On ellen pierce's<br/>computer,
That you and I are a 9.6.
Your fiancé is only
An 8.5.
You looked at my file?
I had to.<br/>You're my only match.
Aren't you even<br/>a little curious?
The woman who set you up<br/>with your fiancé
Thinks we're a better match.
I am getting married<br/>on Saturday.
♪summer breeze...<br/>Ted.
Look, don't you think<br/>you're being a little impulsive
Marrying a guy you just met<br/>a few months ago?
Don't you think<br/>it's a little impulsive for you
To proposition an engaged woman<br/>you don't even know?
See?<br/>We're both impulsive.
We're perfect for each other.
Ted, just calm down.
Calm down?!<br/>You're my only match.
God, there was a computer
And there were eight fish<br/>in a sea full of lesbians and...
Okay, ted, ted.
Do you honestly believe,<br/>deep down,
That there is no one else<br/>out there for you
Just because some computer<br/>says so?
I didn't used to.
But there was math.<br/>I got confused.
Love isn't a science.
You can't calculate<br/>a feeling.
When you fall in<br/>love with someone,
An 8.5 equals a perfect ten.
You're right.
If this thing is<br/>what you say it is,
It could be huge for my career.
Brace yourself, dude.
This is going to<br/>blow your mind hole.
You bastard.
I actually got excited<br/>about this.
What?
It's empty.
Wait, but if<br/>it's not here,
That means...
Lily.
Robin!
What?
Oh, my god.<br/>It's real.
No, is it?
Do something.
What the hell was that?<br/>You trying to get it drunk?
It was the only thing<br/>I could think of.
Lily!<br/>Thank god.
Lily, I love you.
Robin, open up the window!
Open the window! Ah!
It can fly.
Wow.<br/>Wow.<br/>Wow.
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss<br/>this private war of ours.
I grew to admire<br/>your tenacious...
Holy mother of god,<br/>it's headed this way!
Hi, ellen.
I think I want<br/>my money back.
I'm a failure.
I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, ted.
I widened the search parameters.
I tweaked the program.
Last night I stood out<br/>on the street for five hours
Showing your photo to random<br/>pedestrians. No takers.
Although<br/>this transvestite hooker
Said he/she would do you<br/>for half price
Because you kind of look like<br/>john cusack
And his/her favorite movie<br/>was say anything.
Come on, ellen.<br/>I mean, a pint of ice cream,
Isn't that a bit cliché?
It's for the bourbon.
This isn't hopeless.
You're going to find<br/>someone for me.
No, I won't.
You're going to die alone.
I'm not going to die alone.
Look at me.<br/>I'm bright, I'm attractive.
You just got to get back<br/>out there and keep looking.
No, you're never going<br/>to find anybody.
And every year<br/>you're just getting older
And it's getting<br/>harder and harder.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going to be up on that wall<br/>one of these days.
No, you won't!
Yes, I will!
How do you know?
I don't know, but I believe.
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
Can find love<br/>in this crazy city,
Then, damn it, so can I.
You're losing me.
The point is, something good's<br/>going to happen to me.
Maybe your computer will help,
Maybe it won't,<br/>but it'll happen.
So I should keep looking?
Of course you should.
And now, you're going<br/>to do it for free.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, this<br/>is a thanksgiving story.
Thanksgiving in new york<br/>is a wonderful time.
It's a time for giving<br/>of yourself,
For thinking<br/>of your fellow man--
A time when<br/>the unforgiving city
Becomes a little kinder.
Well, I just ralphed.
How much did you guys<br/>drink last night?
Not how much... What?
The thankstini.
A fun
And delicious<br/>new novelty drink I invented.
Cranberry juice, potato vodka,<br/>and a bouillon cube.
Tastes just like<br/>a turkey dinner.
Mmm, it's like<br/>thanksgiving in my mouth!
You want a good<br/>holiday drink,
Try his kwanzaapolitan.
The shuttle's here!
He hasn't been back home<br/>to minnesota since christmas.
He's a little excited.
Lily, we're holding up<br/>the shuttle.
Do you have everything
You need-- toothbrush, pajamas,<br/>underpants?
Underpants!
So, lil...
Marshall's family.
A whole weekend<br/>with the future in-laws.
You excited?
Yeah, no, it'll be fun.
Lily, you just said,<br/>"yeah, no."
Did I?
No. I-I love marshall's family.
Oh.<br/>But yeah, no, it'll be great.
You just did it again.
Yeah, no, shut up.
So you're not going home<br/>for thanksgiving?
No, I have to work<br/>on Friday. You?
I'm canadian, remember?
We celebrate thanksgiving<br/>in October.
Oh, right, I forgot.
You guys are weird.
You pronounce the word<br/>"out," "oat."
You guys are the world's leader<br/>in handgun violence,
Your healthcare system<br/>is bankrupt,
And your country<br/>is deeply divided
On almost every<br/>important issue.
Your cops are called<br/>"mounties."
So probably hanging out<br/>with barney, then?
No. Barney's got his own<br/>thanksgiving tradition.
Thanksgiving<br/>in a strip club.
Who's in?
The lusty leopard has
A surprisingly good<br/>thanksgiving buffet.
Plus they do this thing:
Heather dresses up<br/>as a pilgrim,
And misty dresses up<br/>as an indian,
And they share<br/>a meal together.
Oh, barney.
I'm sorry...
Native american.
I think I'm gonna<br/>go to a homeless<br/>shelter, serve food.
That's awesome!
Yeah, I though I'd<br/>just spend the day<br/>giving back, you know?
Doing some good.
Canceling out barney.
Exactly.
Where are all my underpants!
Did you check your suitcase?
Let's go!
Ted<br/>and go they went...
All the way<br/>to st. Cloud, minnesota,
Marshall's hometown.
And as lily stepped into
Her fiancé's boyhood home,<br/>she received a big welcome.
Hello, we're home!
Hello... Hey...
A very big welcome.
You see, at six-foot-four,
Marshall was the runt<br/>of the eriksen clan.
Wow,<br/>I forgot how tall you guys are.
Where's my almost<br/>daughter-in-law?
Here I am!
Oh...
Oh, you got yourself<br/>a great little bride here, son.
All right, now.
No fartin' around!
Put your skates<br/>and your pads on, boys!
Game on<br/>in five minutes!
Yeah, all right.
Oh, you're gonna<br/>play hockey?
With a basketball?
Well, it's sort of<br/>a combination of the two.
We call it bask-ice-ball.
We invented it.
It's the most dangerous<br/>and awesome sport in the world.
Bask-ice-ball?
Not ice-ketball?
Ice-ketball?
That just sounds weird.
It's bask-ice-ball,<br/>okay?
And I'm the best.
You wish.
Well, maybe that's just 'cause<br/>you haven't seen me play.
Oh...
I don't know, honey.
It's not really<br/>a sport for a girl.
Well, that's funny, because your<br/>brother throws like a girl.
Oh...
Marcus!
This is going<br/>to be great.
I know. I'm so psyched<br/>we did this.
Look at all these people,
Giving up their thanksgiving
These have got to<br/>be the best people<br/>in new york.
♪ ...To grandmother's house...<br/>'scuse me, guys.
Coming through.
Barney?
Well, hi guys.
What are you doing here?
Oh, just the lord's work.
But you're satan.
Guys, okay, look.
I don't advertise it,<br/>but I volunteer here.
I think it's important
To help<br/>the less fortunate.
I'm the angelina jolie<br/>of incredibly hot guys.
This is a joke,<br/>right?
You don't actually<br/>volunteer here.
Barney, we need you out front.
There's a logjam<br/>on the stuffing line.
Can you show them<br/>how it's done?<br/>!<br/>I'm on it.
Wait, so this is real?<br/>Barney does this?
Every Sunday, all year long.
He's our best volunteer.
That's 'cause I was trained<br/>by the best, kendall.
Anyway, we're psyched<br/>to be here, kendall.
What do you need us<br/>to do?
Uh, go home.
We're full.
What?<br/>We're volunteers.
We're unpaid help.
Can you ever really have<br/>enough unpaid help?
On the biggest volunteer day<br/>of the year?
Yeah, you can.
Come on, we just want<br/>to help out.
Kendall,<br/>they're cool.
Fine, but I'm not promising<br/>anything.
Wait here.
We'll let you know<br/>if we need you,
Okay, well, I'd better<br/>get back out there.
There's a lot of food<br/>to give out.
And a lot of smiles.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I know it's early, but...
You are<br/>a future mrs. Eriksen.
Thank you!
Well, it'll go great<br/>with my, uh...
I just love it.
Okay, lily, we're<br/>putting you on salad duty.
Oh, I make this great<br/>frisee and endive salad
With a coriander-<br/>lime vinaigrette.
But this is<br/>an american holiday.
Lily,
Now that you're going<br/>to be a mrs. Eriksen,
I'm going to let you in<br/>on a secret recipe:
The eriksen family<br/>seven-layer salad.
Seven-layer salad?
"six cups of mayonnaise"?
That can't be right.
Oh, no, dear.<br/>16 cups.
Mayo's in that cabinet.
Oh, my god.
There is some serious<br/>bask-ice-ball
Going on out there.
Dad totally nailed marcus<br/>in the face with a snowball,
Which is a foul,
'cause you only get one snowball<br/>per possession,
So I nailed him<br/>in the shin<br/>with my skate
And I totally<br/>dunked it!
Yeah, you were sittin' pretty
Till I whacked you<br/>with that mallet.
Hey, gorgeous.
You having fun?
Yeah, but...<br/>But I kind of miss you.
Could you stay in here<br/>for a little bit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br/>no problem.
It's halftime.
Oh, halftime's over!
Get your butts<br/>out here! Come on.
And I hope you like<br/>the taste of skate, dorko!
Go.
Thanks, baby.
Aw, isn't this great?
Can't you see why everyone<br/>from my high school
Stays in this town?
Hey, marvin, you're<br/>the dorko, dorko.
Man, it's amazing<br/>out there.
I've done so much good today,
I've got like a soul boner.
Man, he way the faces<br/>of the less fortunate light up
When you give them<br/>a hot, nutritious meal.
Is there a better feeling<br/>on earth?
Yesterday you said<br/>the best feeling on earth
Was getting<br/>your toes sucked.
Then you requested<br/>a high-five-- with your foot.
Hey, barn, what do you say<br/>you let us sub in for you,
Scoop stuffing<br/>for a little bit?
You want to scoop stuffing<br/>your first day out?
Hello? Nfl?
Can I be quarterback<br/>this Sunday?
Dude.
Okay, I finished
The gummi bear layer<br/>of the... Salad.
What's next?
Potato chips. Of course.
So, lily...
When are you gonna start<br/>thinking about having a baby?
Baby?
Uh, you know, I hadn't<br/>really thought about it.
At all.
Actually, aunt lily was lying.
It was all she'd been<br/>thinking about.
You see, remember<br/>when she said...
Well, I just ralphed...
At that point,<br/>she was five days late.
This was day six.
Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young<br/>to have a baby, right?
Oh, are you kidding?
I was younger than you<br/>when I had marcus.
Beautiful<br/>15-pound boy.
Not much bigger<br/>than this turkey right here.
Oh, boy.
Now, if lily was already uneasy
About joining<br/>the eriksen family,
Imagine how she felt<br/>about possibly having
A 15-pound eriksen<br/>growing inside of her.
That's a big baby, judy.
The doctor thought he was twins.
Twins!
Twins!
This is crazy!
When did it get so hard<br/>to do charity work?
I do charity work all the time.
Remember when I said<br/>I'd find you a girlfriend?
Delightful.
How's that little project<br/>coming along anyway?
I'm working on it.
I'm gonna introduce you to that<br/>girl you've been staring at.
What? That's crazy,<br/>I haven't been staring
At any girl...<br/>Have you met ted?
Hi. I'm the<br/>aforementioned ted.
And this is...<br/>Um, gone.
I'm amanda.<br/>Hi.
So, uh, what do you<br/>do here, ted?
Well, I've been...<br/>Um, nothing.
I do nothing.
Well, if you want<br/>to do something,
You and your girlfriend
Can help sort through<br/>these donations.
Oh, um,<br/>I'm not his girlfriend.
I used to be, but, um,
I just wasn't<br/>enough woman<br/>for ted emotionally
Or sexually.
Oh, my god.
So, amanda...
What do you need us to do?
Okay, this is important.
Go through all these boxes<br/>of food donations,
Take out the really good stuff,
And put it into this box.
Got it.
Consider it sorted.
Hey, we're in business.
Hey, barney's not gonna get<br/>all the glory today.
Let's start<br/>with this one.
Yeah.
Amen.
Amen.
Look who came<br/>to say good night.
It's little martin.
Three months old.
Months?
Three months.
He's been drinking<br/>his milk.
And she's already<br/>pregnant again?
Well, that's 'cause those<br/>eriksen boys' boys can swim.
They've got two tails<br/>and a drill bit for a head.
Dad, you're<br/>embarrassing me!
Oh, don't worry about it, son.<br/>She's cool.
She's going to be an eriksen.
Yeah. Well, well, not literally,
'cause, you know,<br/>I'm keeping my name.
But... The apron.
Well, we haven't<br/>actually decided
Anything yet, so we're...
No, I've decided
And I'm keeping my own name.
But eriksen is<br/>a great last name.
People know the eriksens.
Well, sure, in st. Cloud,
But our kids aren't going to<br/>be growing up in st. Cloud.
Right, baby?
Well, why not st. Cloud?
I mean, I loved<br/>growing up in st. Cloud.
St. Cloud is a great place<br/>to have a childhood.
Well, so is new york.
What? It is.
And we grew up just fine.
And we grew to the proper<br/>size and then we stopped.
Hey, amanda, what's<br/>this box for?
Oh, that's for me.
You can put it in my car.
In your car, um, and<br/>then you'll take it...?
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra<br/>food, no one can eat it all.
Ooh, truffle oil. Score!
People donated this food
Thinking it was going<br/>to feed the hungry.
I know. And I'm starving.
But, marshall,<br/>you love new york.
Yes, l do, but you always said
That when we have kids, you<br/>wanted to move out of manhattan.
Yeah, to brooklyn.
Why are we even<br/>talking about this?
This is like way down the road.
But lily knew<br/>"way down the road"
Might not be<br/>so far down the road.
I need to go to<br/>the restroom.
Lily, the bathroom's<br/>the other way.
So she literally<br/>headed down the road.
Lily?!
Lily!
So, wait, not only have you not<br/>done any good for anyone today,
You're actually helping someone<br/>steal from the homeless?
You know, ted, it's called<br/>thanksgiving, not thankstaking
Damn.
Barney, you needed me to sign<br/>your time sheet, right?
Oh, yeah,<br/>right. Thanks.
Barney.
Yeah, what's up?
You have<br/>a time sheet?
No one else has<br/>a time sheet.
Yeah. So?
All right, let<br/>me see that.
That's my private,<br/>personal business!
Court-mandated<br/>community service?
Oh my god, you're<br/>on probation?
What did you do?
That's my private,<br/>personal business.
I was unfairly punished<br/>because the wall
Belonged to the judge's church.
You peed on a church?
I peed in an alley,<br/>which happened to have a church,
Which I did not see<br/>because I was drunk.
Oh, you are evil.
Ah, all's right<br/>with the world again.
Okay, fine, so a judge<br/>is making me do this.
But I'm still doing it.
And kicking ass at it, btw.
When's the last time either of<br/>you did something good, huh?
Kendall. Ah, kendall.
Amanda is stealing portobello<br/>mushrooms from homeless people.
Amanda.
I called dibs on the<br/>portobello mushrooms.
Those are for the hungry.
I know.
And I'm starving.
Those are good mushrooms.
Mushrooms. Mushrooms.
Portobello mushrooms<br/>for everyone.
Take them and run!
They're very expensive.
Happy thanksgiving.
"happy thanksgiving." huh.
As in "check out the chick
"buying the knockup test,<br/>everybody.
Wonder what must be going<br/>through her head?"
Yeah, well, since you asked,
A family of mayonnaise-guzzling<br/>giants is trying to suck me
Into their suburban nightmare,<br/>and there's a solid chance
That I have an eriksen<br/>the size of a 15-pound turkey
Growing inside of me!
Oh, you know the eriksens?
You're marshall's fiancée.
Fantastic.
So nice to meet you.
You are taller than described.
Look, I'm sorry<br/>I just yelled at you.
You mind if I use your bathroom?
Don't have one.
What do you do<br/>when you have to...?
I hold it.
You can't fire<br/>a volunteer.
Apparently you can.
And his two non-<br/>mushroom-throwing friends.
I can't believe I told<br/>kendall you guys were cool.
I have 40 hours left<br/>on my community service
And now I've<br/>gotta spend it
Spearing trash<br/>on a freakin' median strip.
Volunteer of the year!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
Look, if there's<br/>anything I can do
To make it up to you just<br/>tell me. I'll-I'll do it.
Ted, I'm glad you asked.
♪ domo arigato, mr. Roboto
♪ domo... Domo
♪ domo arigato, mr. Roboto
Surprisingly good.
Right? I told you so.
Public urination.
Who gets arrested<br/>for public urination?
Lily's been arrested.
Oh, dear. What for?
Public urination.
Thanks, pete.
No problemo, marsh.
You all right?
No. I embarrassed myself<br/>in front of your family,
And now I'm celebrating<br/>thanksgiving
In probably the most<br/>depressing place ever.
♪ domo arigato, mr. Roboto
Well, I'm glad<br/>that you're safe.
Hey, weird question.
Why did you drive three miles<br/>down route 23
And take a pee behind<br/>a convenience store?
Okay, I'll tell you,<br/>but before I do, promise me
That we are not gonna move to<br/>st. Cloud, minnesota. Promise.
I'm not suggesting that we move<br/>here tomorrow, I'm just...
Promise.
Why do you want me<br/>to promise you that?
Because I don't<br/>fit in here.
I'm not eight feet tall,
And I don't think<br/>you could call it a salad
If it has funyuns in it.
I'm funyuns.
And mayonnaise and gummi bears<br/>and bask-ice-ball,
And I love st. Cloud.
And, yes, there is a part of me
That would like<br/>to move here someday,
And why are we<br/>having this discussion
In a jail cell on thanksgiving?
Okay, personal effects.
One wallet.
One cell phone.
One... Pregnancy test.
Pete arrested me<br/>before I could look at it.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Lily, we can't let our kids<br/>play bask-ice-ball.
Bask-ice-ball is<br/>really dangerous.
Yeah, what are the rules<br/>to that game anyway?
There are no rules.
We just whale<br/>on each other.
Look, I don't want to be<br/>exactly like my family.
And don't take this<br/>the wrong way,
But I don't want to be<br/>exactly like your family either.
We'll be our own family.
And we'll find our own way<br/>to freak out the people
Our kids bring home.
Great, now I'm crying.
We may have some really<br/>big decisions to make
In about ten seconds.
But right now,
I don't care where<br/>our kids grow up,
As long as they have<br/>you for a father.
Gosh, I hope<br/>you're the father.
Just a little joke to<br/>lighten up the mood.
What does it say?
I'm afraid to look.
It's negative!
Oh, thank god.
Oh, thank god.
And, hey!
Ted. Are you listening?
You're a good guy.
Want to know why I<br/>have to work tomorrow?
My firm's designing
An executive lounge<br/>for a tobacco company.
In the fight against cancer,<br/>I'm on the side of cancer.
Okay,<br/>ted, I found
A way for you<br/>to help someone.
To do some good.
This is walter.
Walter is homeless.
And walter would<br/>like a lap dance.
Are you joking?
I never joke about the sublime<br/>art of burlesque entertainment.
No, barney, that's insane.
Sir, would you like me to buy<br/>you a ticket to the buffet?
No, I'm stuffed.
Just a lap dance<br/>will be fine.
Ted, walter's been to<br/>three shelter dinners.
You know where<br/>he hasn't been?
To heaven<br/>with samantha.
Look, it's the one chance<br/>you've had all day
To help someone<br/>in need.
Now, buy this man<br/>a lap dance.
You said you wanted to see the<br/>look of joy in someone's eyes.
You know, I don't think<br/>I'm going to watch.
Here you go, walter.
Happy thanksgiving.
Thank you so much.
No, really. Thank you.
Happy thanksgiving, guys.
Thanksgiving in November.
Weird.
♪ I treat it<br/>like a high school dance ♪
So, that was thanksgiving 2005.
To be honest,<br/>it didn't go great.
But life has<br/>plenty of good parts,
It's the rough parts<br/>that make you thankful
You have people<br/>to share it with.
♪ ...Stare at my shoes
♪ you belong to me
♪ I belong to you
♪ I could tell<br/>an antique lie... ♪
Hey.
I saw what you did for that guy.
It was really sweet.
Oh...
Do you want a dance?
Uh, no, thanks.
Do you want some yams?
No, thanks.
I'm amber.
I'm ted.
Actually... I'm tracy.
Still ted.
And that, kids, is the true<br/>story of how I met your mother.
What?!<br/>What?!
I'm kidding.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Now I remember a lot of stories
From back in the days<br/>before I met your mother.
But there's one story<br/>I don't remember.
Uncle marshall still refers to<br/>it as "the pineapple incident."
The night started<br/>like any other.
We were downstairs at the bar.
On the house.
Wow!<br/>Oh!
It's my own concoction.
I call it the red dragon.
Thanks, carl.<br/>Wow!
That was really sweet.<br/>We're not really
Doing shots, are we?<br/>I hope not.
No, no, no.
Ugh! These look<br/>kind of like blood.
Okay, I know that you've all<br/>dismissed this theory before.
But is there any chance<br/>that carl is a vampire?
That's ridiculous.
No, you guys, I'm serious.
Think about it.
He always wears black.
We never see him in<br/>the daylight, only after dark.
Oh, my god.
That does describe a vampire...
Or, you know, a bartender.
I should go get dressed.
Where you going, buddy?<br/>Hot date?
I'll say.
She's going out<br/>with a billionaire.
Lily, I told you<br/>not to call him that.
Wait, you're really going out<br/>with a billionaire?
He's not a billionaire.<br/>He's a hundred-millionaire.
Why do people always round up?
So, uh, where's<br/>thurston howell taking you?
A charity dinner.
Yeah, $2,000 a plate.
$1,500. Stop rounding up.
And it's for third world hunger.
You gonna put out?
What?
There's only one reason he's<br/>taking her to this dinner,
And it's not so little mutu<br/>can get his malaria pills.
I think my soul just<br/>threw up a little bit.
Well, I'm gonna be late.
You guys have fun.
Bye.<br/>See ya.
Bye.<br/>See ya.
You okay?
Sure. Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Girl of your dreams<br/>dating a billionaire.
Okay, first of all,<br/>hundred-millionaire.
And second, she's not<br/>the girl of my dreams.
We're just friends.
Look, it would not be smart<br/>if we got together.
I mean, I'm looking to settle<br/>down, she's looking for...
Wha...? You done? Great.
Check out table number four.
See that little<br/>hottie on the end?
She's short<br/>but has an ample bosom.
I love it.
She's, like, half boob.
Let's go.
Yeah, and say what?
What's our big opening line?
I... Uh...
Daddy's home.
Daddy's home?<br/>Yeah.
Okay, you want us to go<br/>over there right now
And say to those girls,<br/>"daddy's home"?
Really think about that, barney.
Hmm.
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.
Is there even a single item on<br/>the menu that has garlic in it?
Garlic fries.
Okay, well, I'll get<br/>back to you.
Oh, daddy's back.
See, if you'd taken a moment<br/>to think about that...
Then daddy wouldn't have gotten
This seven-digit<br/>father's day card from amy.
Ah.
That worked?
I hate the world.
Ted, your problem is all you do<br/>is think, think, think.
I'm teaching you<br/>how to do, do, do.
Doo-doo.
Totally.
So I think a lot.
I happen to have<br/>a very powerful brain.
It can't be helped.
Oh, yes, it can.
Interesting.<br/>Oh.
Ted, I believe you and I<br/>met for a reason.
It's like the universe<br/>was saying, "hey, barney,
"there's this dude--<br/>he's pretty cool--
But it's your job<br/>to make him awesome."
Your brain screws you up, ted.
It happened with robin,<br/>it happened with half boob,
And it's gonna
Keep on happening<br/>until you power down
That bucket of neuroses<br/>inebriation-style.
So, what, you want me<br/>to do a shot?
Oh, no.
I want you to do
Five shots.<br/>Ooh. Ooh.
More interesting.
Barney, I think<br/>you've officially...
No, don't think. Do.
Ted, he's right: You overthink.
Maybe you should overdrink.
Drink, drink...
Drink, drink, drink...<br/>Drink, drink, drink...
Uh, lily, will you tell these<br/>guys how stupid they're being?
Guys, you are being immature<br/>and moronic, and drink, drink...
Oh!
Drink, drink, drink...
Drink, drink, drink...
Drink, drink...
Let me tell you something<br/>about this brain, okay?
Drink!
Pure alcohol cannot<br/>stop this brain.
Drink, drink...
I love it! I love<br/>it! I love it!
This brain, dear mortals,<br/>is no ordinary brain.
Drink, drink...
This is a super brain.
This brain is unstoppable.
This brain...
And that's all I remember.
Except for a few other<br/>hazy memories.
But really, the next thing<br/>I remember
Was waking up<br/>the following morning.
So there were some<br/>unanswered questions.
How much did I drink?
How did I sprain my ankle?
And who was this girl in my bed?
There's our rock star.
Okay, um...
What the hell happened<br/>last night?
You really don't remember,<br/>superbrain?
So uncle marshall<br/>and aunt lilly filled me in.
And how did you guys<br/>like the shots?
I drank all five, bitch.
I love drunk ted.
Marshall thinks<br/>you're a vampire.
All right, if he pukes,<br/>one of you guys cleans it up.
No dibs.<br/>Oh.
No d... Damn it!
Yes.
How quickly you all forget.
I haven't puked<br/>since high school.
I am vomit-free since '93.
Vomit-free since '93.
That's funny.
I'm funny!
Who are you calling?
Robin.
Oh, bad idea jeans.
No, no, it's a great idea.
That's the whole point<br/>of getting drunk.
You do things you'd never do
In a million years<br/>if you were sober.
Says every girl you've<br/>ever slept with.
Say what?
Hello, robin. It's ted.
Oh, hi, ted.
Hello, robin. It's ted.
Hi, ted.
Sounds like you're having fun.
Robin, have I ever told you<br/>that I am vomit-free since '93?
Listen, ted,
I can't really talk right...<br/>'93?
Dude, that's impressive.
Oh... I don't say this enough,<br/>but you're a great woman,
And a great reporter.
You should be on 60 minutes.
You should be<br/>one of the minutes.
That's sweet... And odd.
But I'm kind of<br/>on a date right now.
Yeah, and I disagree<br/>with barney.
Just 'cause this guy's<br/>spending a lot of money
Doesn't mean<br/>you have to put out.
Take it slow, robin.
Take it slow.
Slow...
Bye, ted.
Slow...
Wow, right.
That's why we don't do shots.
Friends don't let<br/>friends drink and dial.
I need that phone back.
You'll get this back<br/>at the end of class.
Ding. Class dismissed.
Here you go, kid.
You call whoever you want.
Thank you, kind sir.
At least someone<br/>appreciates the fact
That I am doing<br/>and not thinking.
And now, I don't think<br/>I won't not go to the bathroom.
Was that necessary?
He is not making<br/>smart decisions.
Exactly. It's like,<br/>what's he gonna do next?
I don't know,<br/>but I want to find out.
Cheap trick?
Oh, ted.
Hello again, ted.
♪ hey, it's me again
♪ plain to see again
♪ please, can I<br/>see you every day ♪
I love everyone in this bar!
And we love you, drunk ted!
♪ I'm a fool again
♪ I fell in lo...
Ow.
Ted?
Well, that explains the ankle.
Then we brought you home<br/>and put you to bed.
Was there anyone else<br/>in there with me?
Shh.
There's a girl in there!
I know.
And a pineapple.
I know.
Who is she?
I don't know.
What the hell happened<br/>to my jacket?
Whoa.
That girl in there<br/>is alive, right?
I should call barney.
Maybe he knows what happened.
Hello.
Why are you sleeping in our tub?
Uh, the porcelain keeps<br/>the suit from wrinkling.
Wait, were you here when<br/>I went to the bathroom
In the middle of the night?
Don't worry. I slept through it.
I totally didn't<br/>sleep through it.
Oh, and wow, for a little girl,<br/>you got a big tank.
How did you get<br/>in here anyway?
We put ted to bed around 1:00.
Oh, you put ted<br/>to bed, all right.
You guys take care of me.
You guys are the best.
I love you guys so much.
Good night, ted.
Love you, too, buddy.
I'm back, baby doll!
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
He rallies!
And the night begins now!
All right.
Game face on.
Carl, two more.
All right, what do we<br/>think of this one?
I think she...
Trick question. No thinking.
You know what time it is?<br/>Huh?
It's do o'clock. Let's ride.
Bring it!
Hi.
Have you met ted?
Excuse me.
You're calling robin.
I'm calling robin.
Ted, as your mentor<br/>and spiritual guide,
I forbid you from calling her.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
If you complete that call,<br/>I will set your coat on fire.
You're bluffing.
Hello, robin. It's ted.
Ted, for the last time, stop...
Ow!
Ted?
You set me on fire.
Real suede wouldn't<br/>have gone up so fast.
You got robbed. This is a blend.
You set me on fire.
And who's the girl
In my bed?
There's a girl in your bed.
And a pineapple.
Am I the only one who's<br/>curious about the pineapple?
Who is she?
I have no idea.
Nice.
You really don't know
No. After I hosed you down<br/>with the beverage gun,
I brought you back here.
I'd better not<br/>have gotten burned.
Ah...
Did any of you write that?
"hi. I'm ted.
If lost, please call..."
Whose number is that?
I don't know.
Dude, call it.
Ooh, hold on, I'm gonna
Make some popcorn.
Ooh. Okay, you can call now.
God, this is intense.<br/>I love it.
Hello?
Uh... Hi.
Who's this?
You called me. Who's this?
It's ted.
It's carl from the bar.
And then carl filled us in.
Barney, you've always<br/>taken care of me.
You are a gentlemen<br/>and a scholar.
Go into
My stable<br/>and take my finest stallion.
He's yours.<br/>His name is windjammer.
Sleep it off, bro.
I'm back, baby doll!
Yeah.
And I...
Am gonna throw up.
I threw up?
Oh, my streak is over.
Vomit-free since '05<br/>doesn't sound good.
Sorry, carl. Go on.
Carl...
Did you know the word<br/>"karaoke"
Is japanese<br/>for "empty orchestra"?
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?
Are you a vampire?
All right, I'm<br/>cutting you off.
Go home and get<br/>some sleep, ted.
Yeah, the sun's gonna<br/>come up soon.
Wouldn't want to be around<br/>for that, would we?
Do you think it would be<br/>to sneak into the zoo?
I have to see some penguins,<br/>like, right now.
All right, give me your arm.
Okay.
This way, if you pass<br/>out in the gutter...
It tickles.
...Someone will call me,<br/>and I will come get you.
Thanks, carl.
We can't just be friends.
We're attracted to each other,<br/>and we both know it.
Excuse me?
Me and robin, me and robin.
I have to make one more call.
Yeah, this'll go good.
Hey, it's me again.
Look, who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted<br/>to each other.
We-we're young, we're drunk--<br/>half of us anyway--
And we only get one life.
So, why don't you come over<br/>to my apartment right now,
And we'll think of something<br/>stupid to do together?
Really? Great.
Wait. Really? Great.
Thanks, carl.
It's robin.
That's robin<br/>in there.
Did you guys...?
Oh, come on. You've<br/>got to give me this one.
Those five shots got<br/>you further with robin
Than your brain ever did.
See what happens<br/>when you don't think?
You do.
More importantly,<br/>you do robin.
Come on.
All right, right over here.
But, uh, still,
What does this mean?
Are we dating now?
I-I mean, I never pictured it<br/>going down this way,
But maybe that's how<br/>it had to happen.
Someone get him a shot.<br/>He's thinking again.
You know what?
Hold on, man.
Maybe it's not such a bad idea<br/>to think about this one.
You and robin went down<br/>this road before.
You got dinged up really bad.
You know who might<br/>have something to say
About ted's future with robin?
Robin. Go wake her up.
Wake her up and say what?
Daddy's home.
Good luck, buddy.
Hello.
Ted, it's robin.
Are you sure?
Hey, robin,
How are you?<br/>Ted, I think
You and I should have a talk
About those phone calls<br/>last night.
Do you mind if I swing by?<br/>Ask her about<br/>the pineapple.
Uh, yeah, sure,<br/>come on over.<br/>Thanks.
No. Wait, d-d-don't come...
She's coming over. Crap!
Wait. This is killing me.
We have to find out<br/>who that girl is.
Trudy.
My name is trudy.
And then, trudy filled us in.
I'm just surprised you<br/>didn't dump him sooner.
I know. It's two years<br/>of my life
I'm never getting back.
A little part of me wants<br/>to just jump the bones
Of the next guy I see.
Daddy's home.
Or the one after that.
Okay, fair enough.
I've got to prove a point<br/>to a friend, so...
You just gave me your number...
And your name is amy.
Ladies.
I love everyone in this bar!
Look at that idiot go.
He's kind of cute.
Ooh!
What are you doing<br/>in the men's room?
What am I doing<br/>in the ladies' room?
All right,<br/>I came in here,
'cause I thought<br/>I was gonna throw up.
Did you?
I did not.
And the streak continues--<br/>vomit-free since
'93.
I'm sorry, trudy. Go on.
I liked your<br/>performance.
What, the karaoke?
Domo arigato.
I wish I had your guts.
Getting up and making a<br/>complete idiot of myself.
So, do it.
I don't know.
Still, I've had<br/>a pretty serious week.
I could sure stand<br/>to do something stupid.
I'm something stupid. Do me.
You're funny.
Hey, can I call you sometime?
Okay.
Ha, ha.
Here, let me.
Why do they call it karaoke,<br/>anyhow?
Was it invented by a woman<br/>named carrie okey?
These are the kinds of things<br/>I think about.
Karaoke is japanese<br/>for "empty orchestra."
Wow.
That's hauntingly beautiful.
Hey, it works.
Then I guess you're<br/>gonna have to call me.
I got to make one more call.
Hello?
Hey, it's me again.
Hey.
Look, who are<br/>we kidding?
You and I are both<br/>attracted to each other.
We're-we're young,<br/>we're drunk--
Half of us, anyway--
And we only<br/>get one life.
So, I came over here.
And now I'm really,<br/>really embarrassed.
Damn it, trudy!
What about<br/>the pineapple?
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!
Ah, robin's here.
Um, look, trudy,
I need you to hide<br/>in my bedroom.
Why? Is that<br/>your girlfriend?
Ah, no, that's not<br/>my girlfriend.
Um, look, it's complicated.
Oh, you're married.<br/>Yeah, I know.
I can't believe<br/>I did this.
No, no, no,<br/>I-I'm not married. Um...
I'll explain<br/>after you hide.
Hey.
Hi, guys.
Hey, robin,<br/>top of the morning.
Hi.<br/>Hi, robin.<br/>Good sweater.
Um, sorry I kept<br/>calling you like that.
I was pretty drunk.
Uh, no kidding.
Those calls were really weird.
Look, ted, maybe<br/>we need to talk.
Let's go get a snack.
I love to snack.
I'm good.
Hmm.
Come on, those calls<br/>weren't that weird.
Robin! Come hang out!
Okay, I'm gonna make this sound<br/>till you come hang out.
Aaah....
That goes on<br/>for three-and-a-half minutes.
Without a breath?
That's got to be<br/>some kind of record.
Oh, ted, you can't do this.
Please.
We agreed to be friends,
And now you're making it<br/>all confusing.
No, I'm not.
Look, I-I just turned off<br/>my brain for the night.
Nothing's changed.
You've moved on.<br/>I've moved on.
Really? You've moved on?
Yes. What, you<br/>don't believe me?
Oh. Uh, okay.
Trudy, come on out.
You are gonna laugh.
Wait. You were with someone<br/>last night?
Yeah, trudy. She's cool.
Trudy, come on out.
Yeah, seriously,<br/>it's okay.
This is so trudy.
She's really shy...
I think.
Trudy?
Hi, trudy. I'm robin.
It's nice to meet you.
You're right.<br/>She is shy.
She-she must have climbed<br/>out the fire escape.
Whatever. Whatever!
I-I don't care<br/>what you think.
Then why'd you hide her<br/>from me?
Wow. You're good.
Anyone ever tell you<br/>you should be<br/>on 60 minutes?
Yes. You did... Last night.
Really?
Well...
Get some sleep, ted.<br/>You had a long night.
And don't feel bad.
I've woken up with worse.
I left trudy a message,<br/>but she never called me back.
That's just how life works<br/>sometimes.
You turn off your brain<br/>for a night,
And all your left with<br/>the next day is a bad hangover,
A sprained ankle<br/>and a pineapple.
Oh, we never found out<br/>where that pineapple came from,
But it was delicious.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, the thing about<br/>New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure it looks great on TV,
But in reality,<br/>it's always just a big letdown,
But in 2005,<br/>I attempted to do the impossible;
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve,
I had an idea of how to do it, too,
and all it cost was<br/>half my Christmas bonus,
Yeah, that's right. A limo.
- ROBIN: Oh, man, Ted, this is great.<br/>- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last New Year's,<br/>we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year, we party together, or not at all.
Now, I sifted through<br/>your party submissions,
- and I narrowed them down to these five.<br/>- Question.
Yes, Barney,<br/>your submissions were received,
and no, we will not be attending<br/>any parties in your pants.
(ALL EX CLAIM)
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?<br/>That was an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight,
and then narrow them down to one,
the most awesome party<br/>in New York City,
and that is where we will ring,<br/>nay, rock in the new year.
All right, and party number one,<br/>that's where we get to meet Marybeth?
- Marybeth?<br/>- Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.<br/>So tonight, we'll see...
(CLEARING THROAT)
People often ask me,<br/>"Barney, how is it that you're so psyched
- "so much of the time?"<br/>- By who? Who asks you that?
(LAUGHING)
And the answer is right here.
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.
Now, people often think<br/>a good mix should rise and fall,
but people are wrong.<br/>It should be all rise, baby.
Now, prepare yourselves<br/>for an audio journey
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME<br/>PLA YING ON STEREO)
- It's working.<br/>- I'm definitely getting psyched.
God. I'm reaching dangerous<br/>levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!<br/>- Yes! Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Hey, Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.<br/>That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.<br/>It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit,<br/>and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys,
but Derek should be coming by<br/>any minute to pick me up.
OLDER TED; Oh, yeah, Robin was spending<br/>New Year's with her boyfriend Derek,
Derek, He was, like, rich,<br/>successful, handsome,
I hated that guy,
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.
- ROBIN: Bye.<br/>- Happy New Year.
- Bye.<br/>- Here we go.
- Oh, this kind of sucks.<br/>- Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.<br/>We're a man down.
That just means were gonna have to party<br/>that much harder.
Ranjit. Party number one.
- Party number one!<br/>- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party<br/>that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that,<br/>you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be<br/>the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.<br/>I'm Lily, and this is my fianc?, Marshall.
Hi. Marybeth.<br/>It's so great to meet you guys.
- Oh, well, my word.<br/>- Oh, hey. Well, you're friendly.
(NATALYA LAUGHING)
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)<br/>Hello, American party friends of Barney's.
- Oh, no.<br/>- So, Barney, who's your new friend?
- Natalya.<br/>- Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?<br/>- She... Who knows?
The former<br/>Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super drunk fantastic, huh?
(MUMBLING)
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?<br/>- Oh, okay.
I love these shoes, but<br/>the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment<br/>so I can change?
Come on, Lily.<br/>We have a tightly scheduled evening
of awesomeness ahead of us.<br/>I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs<br/>are really barking.
It's true. I can hear them.<br/>What's that, little boys? What's that?
You wanna go for a rock?
(YELLING)
- Ranjit, party number two!<br/>- Party number two!
(ALL CHEERING)
- Party number two, not so good.<br/>- No, let's go back to party number one.
TED: No, no turning back.<br/>Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three!<br/>- Yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!<br/>We have to turn around. We left Natalya.
- Barney, none of us really liked her.<br/>- What?
- Sorry.<br/>- Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So, while you may choose<br/>to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her. What up.
- I'm sorry about Barney.<br/>- No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad<br/>that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too. Just a sec.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
- Hey, Robin.<br/>- Ted, Derek stood me up.
OLDER TED; Derek, Now we had<br/>a tight schedule to keep that night,
and I was already on a date<br/>with another girl,
But it was Robin,
Ranjit, turn it around.
Hi. Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule,<br/>and I screwed it all up.
No. This is perfect. It's meant to be.<br/>We're all back together.
What happened?
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut<br/>closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
(COUGHING)
Okay, now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.<br/>This sucks.
- Oh, dude, not now!<br/>- What? She needs to get psyched!
- Barney!<br/>- Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin. You're not going home.<br/>Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through, so what?<br/>What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine.<br/>I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.<br/>- Marybeth.
Oh, wow, you're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.<br/>Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.<br/>- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.
(STAMMERING) We couldn't<br/>go back for Natalya, a human being,
- but we do have time for hot dogs?<br/>- Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No. No! We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on, we have<br/>an hour-and-a-half before midnight,
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.<br/>- You don't know what you're missing.
- Come on. It's only a 20-minute detour.<br/>- Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.<br/>- Stopping the car.
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?<br/>- No, I'm going home.
- What? No!<br/>- No, you can't, Lily!
I can't stay in these heels any longer,<br/>I just can't.
There's a cab over there,
I'll just run back to the apartment<br/>and change shoes.
But hot dogs.
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go,<br/>but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.<br/>- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them,<br/>and I'll meet you at party number three.
- Are you sure?<br/>- Lf I don't see you, Happy New...
Don't say that. We'll find each other.
- We'll find each other.<br/>- I know we will.
MARSHALL: Bye, Lil.
- Bye.<br/>- Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
- Ranjit, party number three.<br/>- Party number three.
- Oh yeah!<br/>- Look at us, riding around in a limo,
eating hot dogs.<br/>It's like we're the President.
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.<br/>- Oh, so much better.
Guys, is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
OLDER TED; Now, kids, Moby was<br/>a popular recording artist
when I was young,
- No way.<br/>- That's totally Moby. That's awesome.
Should I say something?<br/>I should say something, right?
TED: Moby. Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God, he's coming over.<br/>Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.
- Hey.<br/>- Hello.
What's up? You going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going<br/>to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
(GIGGLING)
- Wow. You're friendly.<br/>- Big fan.
I'm Barney Stinson.
So, what about this party?
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing<br/>with some friends.
Wow. That sounds awesome.
- You guys wanna come?<br/>- Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.<br/>- Ted.
- Sidebar.<br/>- Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?<br/>- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.<br/>I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.<br/>- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by<br/>Moby's party, and then, afterwards...
No, I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta find her.
- Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.<br/>- But... Come on. Moby's party.
Moby's party. Moby's...
- Ranjit, Moby's party.<br/>- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think<br/>a great mix has to rise and fall.
- I think it should be all rise.<br/>- Yes. Moby.
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.<br/>This mix is my pride and joy.
- I never leave home without it.<br/>- That's how I feel about Janice here.
So, then I said, your motorcycle<br/>was like that when I got here.
(GIGGLING)
- You're not Moby, are you?<br/>- Who?
- Moby. The recording artist, Moby.<br/>- No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby,"<br/>you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said, "Tony."
- So, your name is Tony?<br/>- No.
Oh, hey, we're here. All right.<br/>You guys gonna come in?
- No.<br/>- You sure?
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.<br/>It's this dude who owes me money.
No, we're good. We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey. Be safe.
(EXHALES)
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?<br/>- I don't know.
I see a short, bald hipster,<br/>my mind goes straight to Moby.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
That's Marshall's phone.
Hey...
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.<br/>- Oh, Marshall. Thank God I got through!
- Hey, sexy.<br/>- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.<br/>He's out looking for you.
- What? Where?<br/>- Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God,<br/>guess who just walked in? Moby.
Moby? She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there<br/>this instant. That's not Moby!
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...<br/>Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my God.<br/>Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
(GASPING FRANTICALLY)
Who was that guy?
Well, we know it's not Moby,<br/>and it's not Tony.
- Ranjit! Drive!<br/>- Where to?
- Party number three!<br/>- Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no. You were at party number four.<br/>You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that<br/>rather unpsyching experience,
you know what it's time for?
It's time to, what? That's right. Re-psych.
Re...
Where's the...
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my<br/>get-psyched mix!
Barney, Barney, what the hell!<br/>Barney, it's not worth it. Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
(TIRE BURSTING)
Oh, nuts.
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?
No. I am pissed.<br/>Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.<br/>He'll jack it up, slap on a tire,
we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.<br/>Guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know<br/>why all the circuits are jammed?
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.<br/>Everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
Oh, sure. Laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown
trapped on his whirling carousel of suits,<br/>and cigars,
and bimbos, and booze.<br/>Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading? Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause<br/>you lost your get-psyched mix?
I'm sorry.<br/>Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo.<br/>We gotta stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble<br/>to make this an awesome New Year's.
(SINGING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME)
(RANJIT SINGING)
I'm gonna get some air.
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm gonna head out.
My roommates are having a party<br/>not far from here.
What? No!
Look, I know this night isn't turning out<br/>the way I planned, but we...
How long have you been in love<br/>with Robin?
I'm not in love... We're just friends.<br/>Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay. I'm fine.
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.<br/>- That's ridiculous.
- Wait, really?<br/>- Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe<br/>Marybeth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance<br/>at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo, I was five.
I was on the way<br/>to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.<br/>I'm gonna call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.<br/>- Marshall!
Marshall!
- I'm sorry about your girl.<br/>- Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone<br/>to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?<br/>Because I did not.
I did not, too.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Derek. Hi, how's work?
Give you some privacy.
LILY: Marshall!
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now,<br/>we get to party number three by 12:45,
we celebrate the new year<br/>in Central Standard time.
Marshall!
- Give it a rest, Ted.<br/>- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night<br/>into anything more than what it is,
which is New Year's Eve,
which is the single biggest letdown<br/>of a night, every single year.
- Marshall!<br/>- Come on! Come on,
we can still turn this thing around.<br/>We've still got 10 minutes.
Stop trying to chase down<br/>some magical, perfect New Year's, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
- Marshall!<br/>- MARSHALL: Lily!
- Holy crap.<br/>- Marshall!
(MARSHALL YELLING)
I knew I'd catch up<br/>with you guys eventually.
So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily<br/>at party number three, so I walked.
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?<br/>- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out, he signed my shirt.
And guess what I found?
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party,<br/>so I swiped it.
- I know. I know. Come on.<br/>- Come on.
Marshall.
Baby, baby. I was so worried about you.<br/>Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby, all the circuits are jammed.<br/>But, wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured<br/>you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too,<br/>and it is awesome!
I wanna cry. It is so awesome.
- We have to go there.<br/>- How? We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!<br/>- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep<br/>in the front seat the whole time.
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?<br/>- I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away<br/>and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there<br/>in eight minutes?
I'll get you there in six.
(HORNS HONKING)
I don't think I can do it.
- No, come on.<br/>- No, come on.
- Move, you stupid taxi!<br/>- Move...
- Three minutes! Come on!<br/>- Come on!
(CORK POPPING)
Ranjit, put her in park.
(EX CLAIMS)
Dudes, I'm sure<br/>party number five is awesome.
But it's not the best party in New York,<br/>'cause this is.
Right here.
- Cheers. Well said.<br/>- LILY: Cheers.
- ROBIN: Cheers.<br/>- Cheers.
OLDER TED; And just like that, we were<br/>having the perfect New Year's Eve,
Funny thing is, all night long<br/>I'd been trying to chase something down
that was right there in that limo,
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Derek? Derek.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey. Come on in.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short<br/>because I wanted to see you at midnight.
- I can't believe you made it.<br/>- I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
ALL: Eight, seven,
six, five, four,
three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
OLDER TED; You probably wanna feel bad<br/>for your old man at this point in the story,
Well, don't,<br/>Not every night has a happy ending,
But all of it's important,<br/>All of it was leading somewhere,
Because suddenly, it was 2006,
And 2006 was a big one,
Ted.
What the hell, man?<br/>I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy? It's midnight.<br/>Go kiss him.
He kept me waiting.<br/>I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

When you're single, and your<br/>friends start to get married,
Every wedding invitation
Presents a strange moment<br/>of self-evaluation:
"will you be bringing a guest,
Or will you be<br/>attending alone?"
What it's really asking is,
"where do you see yourself<br/>in three months?
"sitting next to<br/>your girlfriend,
Or hitting on a bridesmaid?"
I always checked<br/>that I was bringing a guest.
I was an optimist.
Who the hell am I gonna<br/>bring to this wedding?
Ted, have you ignored<br/>all my teachings?
For the most<br/>part, yeah.
No, you don't bring<br/>a date to a wedding.
That's like bringing<br/>a deer carcass
On a hunting trip.
Oh, ted. Oh, ted.<br/>No-- no date.
Deer carcass?<br/>Really?
That's the metaphor<br/>you're going with here?
Ted, it's a simile.
Well, it's<br/>too late now.
If I don't<br/>bring a date,
A $200 piece<br/>of chicken/salmon<br/>will go uneaten.
I got to bring<br/>someone, but who?
Of course, I knew<br/>who I wanted to bring.
Robin-- the big unanswered<br/>question in my life.
Problem was, she was dating
This really rich guy<br/>named derek.
Derek.
Well, derek and I just broke up.
Oh, no,<br/>that's terrible!
Oh...<br/>Are you okay?
Yeah, do you need<br/>a drink or something?<br/>Nah...
We never<br/>really clicked.
I felt bad, though.<br/>He was pretty bummed.
Ah, don't beat<br/>yourself up.
He'll be fine.
I mean, the guy's,<br/>like, a billionaire.
He can put<br/>his platinum card
On a fishing line
And reel in ten chicks<br/>hotter than you.
Thanks. I feel<br/>a lot better.
I think I'll get<br/>that drink now.
Okay, guys,
I got to say something.
I think my feelings for robin<br/>may be resurfacing.
Oh, please--
They were buried<br/>in a shallow grave.
Not again.
Come on.<br/>Dude?
We all know<br/>how this movie ends.
Ted falls in love,
Love kicks ted<br/>in the sprouts,
No, you guys just have to look<br/>at the whole picture.
Robin was into me<br/>when we first met.
Fact:
Even though she didn't<br/>want a relationship,
We had an amazing kiss<br/>on the roof.
On new year's eve,<br/>we kissed again.
Fact:
I need a date to this wedding.
Wish me luck.
What I don't get is<br/>why is claudia marrying stuart?
She's way hotter than him.
How way?
Way way.
This wedding does sound<br/>pretty amazing, though.
Fancy hotel ballroom,<br/>everybody all dressed up...
Oh, here we go.
What?<br/>We can't get
Anywhere with our wedding plans
Because I want it to be fun
And marshall wants it<br/>to be lame.
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's<br/>a pretty fair assessment
Of our two arguments.<br/>I thought so.
You know what?
Excuse me if<br/>I don't want to get married
Barefoot in the woods<br/>next to
Lake no-one's-going-<br/>to-drive-that-far.
Yes.
I want a ballroom,
And I want a band,<br/>and I want shoes.
I've been dreaming<br/>about this day
Since I was, like...
A little girl?
What up!
Okay. I'm just<br/>saying that
It's my wedding, too,<br/>and I should have<br/>a say in it.
Yes, but I'm the bride,<br/>so I win.
Well, I thought marriage<br/>was about two equal partners
Sharing a life together.
Right, but I'm the bride,<br/>so I win.
I mean, seriously--<br/>claudia and stuart?
I mean,<br/>I've hooked up
With the odd lass<br/>who was beneath
My level of attractiveness,
But, you know, I was drunk.
There's no way claudia<br/>has been drunk for three years.
You know,
I've always found<br/>that the best way
To get over<br/>a failed relationship
Is to celebrate someone<br/>else's successful one.
Oh, it makes sense.
So, with that in mind, uh,
Our friends<br/>claudia and stuart
Are having this crazy<br/>black-tie wedding on Saturday.
You want to be my plus one?
Ooh... "plus one."
You make it sound<br/>so romantic.
Fine.
You want to be my date?
Your date?
I'd love to.
How fancy are<br/>we talking about here?
Oh, you're going to want<br/>to bring your "a" game.
Oh, I'll bring it.
I'll bring it so hard,
The bride's going<br/>to look like
A big white<br/>bag of crap.
I need a dress.
You're going?<br/>That's awesome!
Oh, my god--<br/>four days to find a dress?
I know, it's a suicide mission.
Well, if we leave now...
We can still have<br/>a fighting chance.
Let's do it!
Bye, babe.
Whoa!
Did you see<br/>how fired up she was?
I don't know,
There's something<br/>there.
And, come Saturday,<br/>a little music,
A little dancing,<br/>a lot of champagne...
Who knows?
Wow. Ted, you're going<br/>to have to find
Another gender for yourself,
'cause I'm revoking<br/>your "dude" membership.
Yeah... How was that<br/>manicure yesterday?
Invigorating, thanks.
Okay, I wasn't going to say it<br/>in front of the guys,
But back then I really thought<br/>that's how it worked.
You put yourself<br/>and a girl you like
In some romantic setting...
...The stars line up...
And shazam.
I know now that life<br/>is never that simple.
Hey, claudia!<br/>Huh...
Yes, I want<br/>tahitian vanilla!
You wrote it down wrong?
No, no, no, no,<br/>listen to me--
If I go to my wedding
And the cake is not<br/>tahitian vanilla,
I will come down there
And burn your little shop<br/>to the ground!
Do you want to find out<br/>if I'm kidding?
Yeah, good-bye.
Hey!
How's it going?
My wedding is in two days,<br/>that's how it's going.
Oh, don't worry,<br/>it's going to be great.<br/>I'm so excited.
Well, you should be--<br/>lots of single girls.
Oh, well, yeah, I'm...<br/>Bringing a date,
So I'll be<br/>off the market.
What?
I'm bringing a date.
You're not bringing a date.
Uh... Yes, I am.
Uh, no, you're not.
I checked "plus one."<br/>no, you didn't.
Claudia,<br/>I'm pretty<br/>sure I checked...
Ted, you did not<br/>check "plus one"!
You are not bringing<br/>a date to my wedding!
But I already<br/>invited someone.
You are not bringing<br/>a guest, ted!
The guest list has been<br/>closed for months-- months!
But I checked<br/>"plus one"!
I always check<br/>"plus one"!
You absolutely did not<br/>check "plus one"!<br/>If you had checked
"plus one," I would<br/>have called you to get<br/>the name of your guest,
So I could have the place cards<br/>printed up. Did I call you to<br/>get the name of your guest?
Is there a place card<br/>with her name printed on it?
She doesn't need<br/>a place card.<br/>She knows her name.
What's she eating?! Huh?!<br/>You ordered the chicken.<br/>What did she order?
Do you see how your story<br/>is full of holes?
Come on, claudia,<br/>we go way back.
Isn't there room for<br/>just one more person?
Don't make me<br/>hurt you, ted.
I don't believe this!
Claudia's crazy!
But, to be fair,<br/>she's also hot.
I totally checked "plus one."<br/>I'm sure I did.
Yeah, right.
I did!
Yeah, I don't think you did.
You know why?
Because deep down,<br/>you didn't want
To show up<br/>at this thing<br/>with a date.
About being ready<br/>for a relationship,
Deep down,<br/>you're single.
It's your default setting.
Ted, you know what's<br/>in the back of your brain?
Oh, great, here comes<br/>the little barney speech.
Behind a curtain,<br/>in a dark little room
Secretly controlling<br/>your every move?
A little barney...
A little barney.
And you know what he said?
"Ted...
"you will bring no dates<br/>to this wedding.
"you...
"will hit on drunk bridesmaids
With actual-size<br/>barney."
Wow. Please stop.
I got to call claudia.<br/>If I just explain to her...
Ted, no!<br/>Let it go.
She's about to get married,
She's got enough<br/>to worry about.
Then what am I going to do?
The only thing<br/>you can do--
Tell robin<br/>she can't come.
Just a second!
Hey!<br/>Hey.<br/>Listen...
Wait, two things.
I have been laying groundwork<br/>all afternoon.
Totally subtle, totally cool,
Not pushing,<br/>not even nudging, just:
The theme of today is,<br/>"ted rocks."
And she's picking up<br/>what I'm laying down.
Lily, there's a problem...<br/>Wait, no.
Thing number two: The dress.
We got a dress.
Go.
Well?
Did I bring it, or...
Did I bring it?
I think I brought it.
Wow.
That's what I was going for.
I'm so excited about tomorrow.<br/>We're going to have so much fun.
Yeah, about that...
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
So? The dress?
I don't have a plus one<br/>for the wedding.<br/>What?
I ran into claudia,<br/>and she told me
I didn't check "plus one"<br/>on the reply card.
Why didn't you check "plus..."?
I did check "plus one."
But robin is so excited.
I know.
And the dress!
I know.<br/>Uh...
Okay, okay.
Well, we'll<br/>sneak her in.
We can't sneak her in,<br/>we're not ninjas.
Oh, I wish<br/>we were ninjas.
I know.
You could always ask stuart.
Can I do that?
You guys have been friends<br/>for a long time.
And it's 40% his wedding, too.
I don't know...
It's going to be<br/>a tough sell.
Dude, no problem whatsoever.
Really?
Sure, the more,<br/>the merrier.
Wow! Wow, thanks for being<br/>so cool about this, 'cause
You know,<br/>claudia said...<br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This morning at<br/>the rehearsal,<br/>claudia called
Our seven-year-old<br/>flower girl a whore.
So, don't take it personally,
She's just<br/>a little stressed.
Yeah, she's not usually<br/>like that.
No.
Well, thanks, stu!
It's going to be<br/>a great wedding.
Honey, this magazine says<br/>more and more couples
Are opting to have<br/>non-traditional weddings
Out in the woods.
Well, if a magazine says so,
We should go get married<br/>in the woods,
Like a couple of squirrels.
Squirrels don't get married,<br/>marshall.
Like you could possibly<br/>know that.
I did it.
I did it-- I'm taking her<br/>to the wedding.
Nice!<br/>What? How?
I talked to stuart.
You went around<br/>the bride.
"oh, this hornets' nest<br/>looks harmless.
Maybe I'll poke it<br/>with a stick."
"oh, look, some gremlins.
Let me go feed them<br/>after midnight!"
Did you know about this?
It may have been my idea.
What?
Stuart doesn't get a say?
Ah! So you admit it--
The groom should<br/>have an equal say.
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid<br/>stuff, like who comes.
So I can invite<br/>whoever I want?
Sure, there's plenty of room<br/>in the woods.
It's claudia.
Uh!
So it begins.
Come on, it can't be that bad.
Here, lily,
You answer it.
What? Why?
Because this whole thing was<br/>your idea.
And... Claudia scares me.<br/>But... But you're the...
Oh!
Ted's phone.
Oh, hi, claudia.
What?
Now I wasn't there,<br/>but from what I heard,
It went something like this...
Oh, by the way, honey,<br/>ted stopped by
And I told him he could bring<br/>his date to the wedding.
You what?
...Always undermining me<br/>at every turn...
...Try to show<br/>a little flexibility, but no!
It's all about you!
...And your mother...
You know what?
The wedding's off!
They broke up!
Ow!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's not because of me,<br/>is it?
And my dad already paid<br/>for this huge wedding!
Oh, he's going<br/>to kill me!
And then he's<br/>gonna kill ted!
Then I'm gonna<br/>kill ted.
It's robin.
Answer it!
Uh, lily's phone.
Ted, where's lily?<br/>I need to tell her
About these awesome shoes<br/>I just bought.
Uh, lily's busy.
Oh, okay, well,<br/>I just wanted to say
They're gorgeous<br/>and ted's going to love them.
That's great, I'll tell<br/>lily to tell me.
Uh, listen, I really<br/>want to keep talking,
Um, but now's<br/>not a good time,
So I'm really excited<br/>about tomorrow,<br/>okay, bye.
Okay, bye.
Crap, she bought<br/>some expensive shoes.
She's really looking forward<br/>to this.
Do you think<br/>she's into me?<br/>Ted, focus!
Okay, okay, sweetie,<br/>just calm down.
Do you want to go somewhere<br/>and talk?
I want to go somewhere<br/>and drink!
Okay, meet me<br/>at maclaren's.
I'll see you there.
Oh, I feel terrible.<br/>Well, feel<br/>terrible later.
Right now,<br/>we gotta fix this.
Lily, you go<br/>down to the bar<br/>and comfort claudia.
Ted and I will go<br/>and try to talk<br/>some sense into stuart.
Right.<br/>Um, tell claudia I'm sorry.
Did she seem pissed at me?
She said if there's<br/>no wedding tomorrow,
You owe her father<br/>$400,000.
What say we get these crazy kids
Back together?
Hi, sad eyes.
What's got you down?
Stuart and I just broke up.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
That's just, that's...
Two vodka cranberries, please.
You remembered I drink<br/>vodka cranberries.
Remember?
When it comes to you,<br/>how can I forget?
They all drink<br/>vodka cranberries.
So... Is there anything else<br/>you need... Sweetie?
You got $400,000?
No.
But I do have a hug.
Thank you.
Stuart, I-I don't know<br/>what to say.
If I caused this in any way...
Ted, for all I know,<br/>you did me
The biggest favor anyone's<br/>ever done me.
Oh, come on, man,<br/>you don't mean that.
No, I do-- this whole thing<br/>has made me
Realize I miss being single.
I miss staying out late,
And making messes<br/>and not cleaning them up.
I miss owning porn.
Dude, who doesn't?
And you know, I'll see
Some super-hot model chick,<br/>and I'll think,
"why am I with claudia?
That's just crazy!
I mean...
You're the luckiest...
You and claudia both...
The point is I want<br/>to get married.
I want to settle<br/>down, but right now,
That's just not who I am.
I'm not a commitment guy;<br/>I'm a single guy.
Stuart, you don't have to be one<br/>or the other.
Everybody feels<br/>this way sometimes.
Relationships aren't easy;<br/>they're hard work.
It's about compromise,<br/>growing together,
All that dr. Phil crap.
How would you know?<br/>You're not even married.
Okay, ask this guy.
Nine years he's<br/>been with lily.
He's the pro-- this<br/>guy knows relationships.
Tell him, marshall.
Stuart,<br/>don't get married.
Dude...<br/>What?
Look, I'm sorry.
Being in a couple is hard.
And committing,<br/>making sacrifices, it's hard.
But if it's the right person,<br/>then it's easy.
Looking at that girl<br/>and knowing she's all
You really want out of life,<br/>that should be
The easiest thing<br/>in the world,
And if it's not like that,<br/>then she's not the one.
I'm sorry.
You know I don't<br/>have $400,000, right?
Maybe we got<br/>together too young.
Maybe that's what<br/>the problem was.
I mean, I'm<br/>28 years old,
And I've really only<br/>ever been with one man.
That's just, that's...
Two more<br/>vodka cranberries, please!
Claudia...<br/>It's all gonna be okay.
Oh, thanks for<br/>listening, barney.
It really means<br/>a lot to me.
Isn't it weird<br/>that we should...
Run into each other<br/>like this?
Two souls, of equal levels<br/>of attractiveness,
Both fitting together<br/>like two pieces
Of a very<br/>attractive puzzle.
Oh, hell, no!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Claudia is<br/>getting married tomorrow,
If I catch you even so much as<br/>breathing the same air as her,
I will take those peanuts you're<br/>trying to pass off as testicles,
And I will squeeze them so hard<br/>your eyes pop out,
And then I'll feed them to you<br/>like grapes!
Wait, my eyes or<br/>my testicles?
One of each.
All right! All right!
Claudia?
Stuart.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, too.
I love you.
I love you too, babe.
Marshall and ted<br/>set me straight.
And when marshall told me<br/>not to marry you,
It made me realize I...
Marshall said what?!
It's more complicated than that!
He made me realize<br/>how much I love you.
These guys got us<br/>back together.
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.
So where did we land on<br/>the whole plus one thing?
No, no, no, no!
It took five men
And three more vodka<br/>cranberries to subdue claudia,
But, eventually,<br/>she graciously agreed
To let me bring robin.
Still wow.
Wow yourself.
Look who else brought it.
Oh, yeah.
I thought about<br/>leaving it at home,
But I figured I don't want<br/>to get there and realize
I need it and have to go<br/>all the way back to get it.
So, yeah, I brought it.
Oh, sorry.
Hello?
Oh, my god. Tonight?
You're kidding.
They want me<br/>to anchor the news tonight.
Really?
Like anchor anchor?
What happened to sandy?
Okay.
Okay. Sure.
What time do you need<br/>me to... Right now?!
Oh.
Do it.
Do it.
Okay, I need like<br/>five minutes to change,
And, um, I'll call<br/>you from the cab...
♪ I've seen a million faces
♪ but still,<br/>my heart embraces... ♪
So admit it.
This wedding is both<br/>indoors and amazing.
I'll give you the crab puffs.
The crab puffs are good.
The crab puffs<br/>were incredible.
We should totally have them<br/>at our wedding.
Definitely... Hey.
We just agreed<br/>on something.
Did we just start planning<br/>our wedding?
I think that we did.
We totally have to get<br/>that brown dipping sauce.
Ooh, I thought the red<br/>sauce was, like, awesome.
My god, were you born<br/>without taste buds?
What?
I love you.
♪ no, nobody
♪ like you...
Coming up, are there snakes<br/>living in your walls?
The answer may surprise you...<br/>After the break.
Man, you know something?
Stuart's my new hero.
If that dude<br/>can bag a nine,
I got to be able<br/>to bag, like, a 16.
What's a 16?
Those two eights<br/>right over there.
Yeah.
Hi, ted.
Claudia.
We just wanted to get a picture<br/>with the woman
Who almost ended<br/>our relationship.
Yeah, where is she?
Um... She couldn't make it.
What's so funny?
Oh, plan a wedding.
You'll see.
Look at that.
That's how it's<br/>supposed to be.
That right there.
Easy, simple.
It's just not like that<br/>with robin.
It's not easy,<br/>and on some level,
It has to just be easy.
Speaking of easy...<br/>Bridesmaids, ted.
Bridesmaids.
By the way,
I almost forgot.
We found this.
I didn't check "plus one."
You were right.
Of course,<br/>I was right.
I'm single.
Maybe that's just who I am.
And you know what?
I like being single.
Being single's<br/>the best.
Yeah, stay out<br/>as late as you want.
The whole world<br/>full of endless possibilities.
Never having to go<br/>to a farmer's market.
Okay.
Ah... Doing<br/>some math here.
Table six has got<br/>three bridesmaids:
An eight, an eight,<br/>and a seven.
I am willing to give<br/>you one of the eights,
Lowering myself<br/>to a 15,
Which means<br/>you owe me...
So there we were,<br/>two single guys,
Doing our usual<br/>single-guy thing.
For whatever reason,<br/>I had let myself believe
That this night<br/>would be a turning point,
That this was the night<br/>my life--
My real life--<br/>would finally begin.
The funny thing is...<br/>I wasn't totally wrong.

Because that night<br/>was just beginning.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED; Kids, in life there are a lot of<br/>big romantic moments,
and they make life worth living,
But here's the problem,
Moments pass,
And lurking just around the corner<br/>from those moments
is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality,
And so, back in 2006,
on the night of<br/>Claudia and Stuart's wedding,
reality was the enemy,
Wow, the Peace Corps?
Yeah, I ship out tomorrow. Two years.
You know, some people say
the Peace Corps is the most noble thing<br/>a person can do.
To those people I say, "Is it?"
And usually, they say, "Yes, it is."
But, Barney, they are so right.
Wish there was something I could do.
Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.
This wasn't how I'd thought<br/>the night would turn out,
This was finally supposed to be<br/>my big moment with Robin,
but then reality came along,
Robin got called up last minute<br/>to anchor the 11,{{{{{00 news,
It was her big break,
And I went to the wedding stag,
Then, when I least expected it,,,
Hey, where the hell<br/>did you disappear to last night?
I had the most amazing night ever.
Tell me about it.<br/>That cake! Best cake I ever had.
Seriously. My stomach was like,
"Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating,<br/>'cause I don't have any eyes,
"but it's basically awesome.<br/>So keep sending it down gullet alley."
Yeah, I know. My stomach was like,
"Girlfriend, we don't always get along,<br/>but that cake..."
TED: Lily?
Oh, right.<br/>Most amazing night ever, and go.
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.
I never hook up at weddings.
I'm guessing<br/>you haven't always had this rule.
Well, here's the thing.<br/>Those big, romantic moments,
they're great when they happen,<br/>but they're not real.
Exactly. Exactly. Like just now,
when I saw you<br/>doing the Chicken Dance out there,
I'm not gonna lie to you,<br/>big time thunderbolt.
You should see me tap dance.<br/>You'd be down on bended knee.
Sadly, not out of character.
But, I know now, it's just a mirage.
- Wedding goggles.<br/>- Exactly.
And that, in a nutshell,<br/>is why I'm not putting the moves on you.
- This isn't the moves?<br/>- What, you... You think this is the moves?
Believe me, you'd know the moves.
People 10 tables away<br/>would know the moves.
- That's too bad.<br/>- Tell me about it.
You know, I think I have a solution.
Interested.
And to preface this,<br/>we're not gonna sleep together tonight.
Less interested.
- Go ahead.<br/>- Okay.
So the thing that always screws it up<br/>is the next day. Right?
So, why don't we just cut that part out?
- What are you saying?<br/>- I'm saying, I'm here, you're here.
This is a big, romantic wedding.
Why don't we just dance<br/>and have a great time?
And then when it's over,<br/>never see each other again.
- Unless...<br/>- No, no unless.
No emails, no phone numbers,<br/>not even names.
Tonight, we will make a memory<br/>that will never be tarnished.
And then, when we're old and gray,
we'll look back on this night,
and it'll be perfect.
Wow.
- Okay, I'm in.<br/>- Okay.
I guess... What, we'll need fake names?
You can call me Buttercup.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.<br/>I'm Lando Calrissian.
Wow, this is kind of exciting.<br/>Our names will forever be shrouded in...
Ted, Ted, Ted, look. I got a bridesmaid.
Ted, look. Look, Ted.<br/>The second hottest bridesmaid!
Ted, look. See you, Ted.
So, I'm Ted.
Victoria.
- But no last names.<br/>- No last names.
What is wrong with you?
Yeah, dude, that is just like<br/>a weenie ass idea.
No, it was awesome. I had a great night.
I'm never going to see her again.<br/>And there's no way to ruin it.
Ted, how do I explain this to you?
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.
Now you think I'm gonna let that cake<br/>out of my life? Hell, no.
I'm gonna find out<br/>what bakery made that cake,
and damn it,<br/>I'm gonna get some more cake.
That cake really got to you, huh?
It haunts me.
So, what happened next?
Okay, ground rules have been established.
Now, let's see some of these moves<br/>I've heard so much about.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint<br/>a big favor and steal the bouquet.
Yes, but we'll need a diversion.
Kiss!
ALL: Kiss! Kiss!
(ALL CHEERING) Kiss, come on. Kiss! Kiss!
Go, go, go.
So, that's what happened to the bouquet.
You know, good for Victoria.<br/>It's such an evil tradition.
- You're not gonna do it at your wedding?<br/>- Oh, yeah!
I'm gonna take that flower grenade<br/>and chuck it into the crowd and scream,
"Crawl for it, bitches!"
It's just what girls do.
So, where'd you guys go?
(TED PLAYING THE ENTERTAINER<br/>ON THE PIANO)
- Very nice.<br/>- Yeah?
Okay, I don't really know<br/>how to tap dance.
I couldn't tell.
Oh, it's too bad<br/>you're not gonna get some tonight!
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.
No, you couldn't.
You're a dude.
- I could get some.<br/>- You could totally get some.
We're not gonna kiss tonight.
(BANGS PIANO KEYS)
I mean, if we kiss, all of this becomes real.
You might use too much tongue,<br/>I might not use enough.
And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.
I will use exactly the right amount<br/>of tongue.
Okay, how about this?
The best part of any first kiss<br/>is the lead up to it.
The moment right before the lips touch.
It's like a big drum roll.
So, how about tonight
we just stick with the drum roll.
- Okay.<br/>- But we can't kiss.
Okay.
A drum roll? That's it?
So, what? You just...<br/>You said good night, came home,
and performed a drum solo?
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.
She was completely amazing.
She was amazing and funny<br/>and we connected on every level,
and I'm never gonna see her again.
Damn it, I have to see her again.
- Yes!<br/>- Yes!
So let's get to work, man.<br/>What else do you know about her?
Nothing, her name's Victoria.<br/>That's all I got.
Wait, Claudia. Claudia would know.
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.<br/>She'll be back in two weeks.
- Call her then.<br/>- Yes, two weeks. Good idea.
- I'm calling her now.<br/>- No, Ted.
- You don't mess with a honeymoon.<br/>- Yeah, come on, dude.
Ask her about the cake.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Ted?<br/>- Hey, Claudia!
Great wedding, beautiful toast,<br/>touching stuff. How's the honeymoon?
Listen, I'm calling because<br/>last night I met this girl,
and I was wondering if you had...
Oh, you have got to be<br/>freaking kidding me!
Here we go.
Twenty-four hours ago,<br/>you were begging, begging me
to bring some other girl to my wedding<br/>and now, what, you're over her?
I've moved on.
What was her name?<br/>Is it my fat cousin Lindsey?
Don't be embarrassed.<br/>She has pretty eyes.
No. Her name was Victoria.<br/>I don't know her last name.
Well, lucky for you. I know that guest list<br/>backwards and forwards.
Thank God!
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria<br/>at my wedding. Goodbye, Ted.
There was no Victoria at the wedding.
Maybe she used a second fake name.
Oh, she's good. She's very good.
Maybe she was a ghost.<br/>That's why she didn't want to kiss you.
Because you'd just pass right through her<br/>and feel really cold for a second.
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea<br/>for a screenplay.
Marshall, she was not a ghost.
I know that she wasn't a ghost.
She picked up a bouquet<br/>proving she had corporeal form.
Wait! She was sitting across<br/>from a couple of bridesmaids.
She must have been at their table.<br/>Maybe they know who she was.
Great! So, how do we get in touch<br/>with the bridesmaids?
This better be good.<br/>I'm about to enter Nirvana.
By the way, I should get you<br/>Nirvana's phone number.
She gives a great massage. Say what?
Barney!
I know the house rules.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Listen, Barney. I saw you talking<br/>to that bridesmaid last night.
- Did you happen to get her phone number?<br/>- You know I did.
Great! I'm gonna need you<br/>to call her for me.
You know I won't.
Why not?
Because, we just hooked up last night.<br/>I can't call the girl the next day.
I have to wait at least, like, forever.
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.
Besides, she thinks<br/>I'm on my way to India.
Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl<br/>is exactly not a good cause.
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you.<br/>My hands are tied.
Oh, no, wait, that was last night.
(MIMICS WHIP CRACKING)
Okay, Barney,<br/>I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
You make this call
and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
But, you always said<br/>the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy,
- nor good at boxing.<br/>- I'm ready to be proven wrong.
- Tonight?<br/>- Tonight!
Dial.
Yeah, Tanya. Turns out I don't leave<br/>for the Peace Corps until tomorrow.
Yeah, I know. It sucks.
Just one fewer day I get to help people.
Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was?
Hold on. What kind of shoes was she...
No, Tanya, he's a dude.
He's not gonna know<br/>what kind of shoes she was wearing.
Actually...
Oh, come on!
Hey!
So, what do you want to do next?<br/>Don't think!
First thing that comes into your mind.
Hold this.
And this.
There she goes.
Apparently, she was wearing brown shoes
with little snowflakes on them.
Yeah, they do sound cute.
Any idea who...
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.<br/>Yeah, you take care.
What's...
Tonight?
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early.
So, I won't be able to stay over,<br/>but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able<br/>to make Foxy Boxing tonight.
I understand.
Okay. Let's not lose hope.
We'll call the hotel.<br/>Maybe she was staying there.
We'll have them check the registry<br/>for anyone named Victoria.
- Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...<br/>- Or Ictor.
She probably doesn't go by Ictor.
No, you know what? This is fate.<br/>I am never supposed to see this girl again.
That was the whole point of the night.<br/>I've just been saved from myself.
- Let's drink many beers.<br/>- Agreed.
And I thought that was the end of it,<br/>But then,,,
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Hey, there's the anchor lady.<br/>- Hello.
- How was it?<br/>- Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you ask the new substitute<br/>weekend anchor?
Robin? Thanks, Robin. It was awesome.
- Back to you, Robin.<br/>- Congrats!
- Thanks.<br/>- That's so cool.
Yeah, I felt really bad<br/>bailing on Ted though.
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...
And then Lily told her the whole story,
right down to the brown shoes<br/>with the little snowflakes on them,
And by the end of it,,,
What?
I know who she is.
You know who she is?<br/>But you weren't even at the wedding.
Actually I kind of was.
What?
Well, after the newscast I was so excited,
I decided to surprise Ted<br/>by going to the reception.
Oh, damn it.
Oh, stop it.
What the hell?
VICTORIA: Hello?
You okay in there?
Yeah, I'm fine!
Just allergies or something. I'm fine.
Listen, do you wanna come<br/>and cry out here?
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.
Oh, thanks.
But I don't actually cry in front of people
or cry at all for that matter.
Man, it's gross.
Does everyone snot up this much<br/>when they cry?
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.
So, why you crying?
Because you have feelings for Ted.
I don't know. Maybe?
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you?<br/>Seriously!
He likes you, and you like him,<br/>and just be together!
Jeez, Louise,<br/>happiness is not that difficult.
Oh, look, okay.
Yes, I cried in the bathroom<br/>and that was weird.
But that doesn't mean<br/>I'm in love with the guy.
The fact is, I don't know how I feel.
Yes, you do.
Seeing him with someone else<br/>and crying about it?
Guess what? That's how you feel!
That is nothing but how you feel.
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy?
Kind of, yeah.
But it doesn't change anything.
I still don't wanna get married,<br/>and he's still Ted.
What I should do is just tell him<br/>who Victoria is, so he can be happy.
Or you could tell him that you're into him<br/>and then you could both be happy.
I'm gonna go find him.
Well, wait.
Which one are you gonna tell him?
I have no idea.
And here's the most amazing part.
Because I told her I had converted<br/>all my money to India dollars,
she gave me $50 to take a cab<br/>to the airport.
That's right. I just got paid for sex.
I really should give this money<br/>to the Peace Corps.
They've done so much for me lately.
- Hi, guys.<br/>- Hey.
Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Sure, what's up?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I have to tell you something.
Oh, just get it.
- Hello?<br/>- Ted? It's Stuart.
My lovely bride would like to say<br/>something to you.
Ted.
I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.
My new husband and vodka cranberry,
which cost $10.50<br/>at the freaking airport bar...
- When is this plane going to board?<br/>- Sweet pea.
(CLEARING THROAT)
...have helped me realize that<br/>sometimes I can act like a crazy person.
And I don't want my new husband to think<br/>I'm a crazy person.
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.
Marshall wanted to know<br/>where you guys got that cake.
Cake?
Why don't you take this?
Sounds like you could use it.
Thanks. You're very sweet.
So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?
We got it at this little bakery downtown.
Actually, neither.
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I made the cake.
She made the cake.
Buttercup Bakery!
She wasn't on the guest list,<br/>because she wasn't a guest.
She made the cake!
She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl.
You gotta marry her. Today.
She has to move in with us.
- I'm going down to that bakery.<br/>- No, no, don't do it.
Baby, what are you talking about?
Yeah, all day long you've been busting<br/>my apple bag about finding this girl.
Well, I just think that<br/>maybe she's not that into you.
And that's why<br/>she didn't give you her number.
Robin, care to chime in with anything?
Yes.
Ted,
go get her.
Going. Getting!
Ted. Oh, my gosh, I love this moment.
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna say it.
And this time,<br/>you're actually gonna say yes.
You ready? You ready to say yes?<br/>Ted, suit up!
Yes!
- No.<br/>- Oh, come on!
- Guess we were gone a while.<br/>- Oh, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to one last dance.
(MUSIC PLA YING ON CD PLA YER)
Why, yes, I am.
Sorry, I could tell<br/>what you were just thinking.
Wow, what was I just thinking?
Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.
- You got me. You are good.<br/>- Yeah.
You know, I don't look like this every day.
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears<br/>a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt
with bleach stains on it.
The real Ted sounds real sexy.
It's too bad I'll never get to see it.
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.
Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.
Ted? You still with us?
Tell me your last name.
You know, there's one little flaw<br/>in our plan.
What's that?
I'm gonna go home tonight<br/>with a lot of great memories,
and one really sucky memory.
The memory of you walking out that door.
Hey, Ted.
Yeah?
Close your eyes and count to five.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
TED; Until our dying days, we'll remember<br/>everything about that night
as perfect,
Maybe we both need that.
I mean, so many things go wrong in life,
but this is the one thing that never will.
It will always, always be pure,
unadulterated, awesome.
If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us<br/>of what could be...
The meter's running, dude.<br/>Crap or get off the pot.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.
Oh, thank God!

When you meet someone special,
Suddenly life is<br/>full of firsts.
The first night together.
The first weekend together.
For me,<br/>all those firsts happened
Within 48 hours<br/>of meeting victoria.
They have to come out<br/>soon, it's Monday.
Do you think they've been<br/>in there the whole time?
I don't know whether to be<br/>proud or concerned.
Maybe they're not<br/>even in there.
Good morning.<br/>Hey, guys.
I'm just going<br/>to ignore that.
Thank you!
I wish you could stay.
But I have to go to work,<br/>and you have that meeting.
Call you afterwards?
I'll inappropriately<br/>text you during.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.<br/>Oh, victoria,<br/>you're here...
Toot-a-loo!
Bye.
Two days straight?!
Wow, your room must smell<br/>like a monkey cage!
Come on,<br/>give us a number.
Lily guessed eight,
But I know my boy got<br/>to double digits.
Zero.
What?<br/>What?
Guys, we just met.
And we both screwed up<br/>relationships in the past
By jumping in too quick,
And we decided<br/>to take this one slow.
Her idea.<br/>Totally her idea!
But, I don't know,<br/>I'm really into this girl,
And if going slow is what<br/>it takes to make this happen,
I say bring it on.
I don't feel so good.
It's like my testicles<br/>mixed pop rocks and soda.
I can't believe she's making you<br/>wait a whole month.
I would never<br/>put up with that.
You've only had sex with<br/>one girl in your whole life.
Burn!
Ted, the only reason<br/>to wait a month for sex
Is if the girl is<br/>17 years, 11 months old.
Good news: I don't<br/>have to cover
The cat show tomorrow night.
Who's up for hanging out?
Oh, I can't,<br/>I'm taking victoria<br/>out for dinner.
No, no, we can't, it's<br/>our nine-year anniversary.
Wow, nine years?
Your relationship's<br/>a fourth grader.
Congrats.
We're going to the berkshires<br/>for the maple syrup harvest.
It's one of new york magazine's
"top five romantic<br/>getaways on a budget."
Who says sexual<br/>can't be sensible?
Well, looks like it's going<br/>to be just you and me.
Really?
Actually, I was talking<br/>to my martini.
Ready to go?<br/>Hell, yeah.
Nothing better than a weekend<br/>at a good bed and breakfast.
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast<br/>at 7:00 a.M.
Sharp.
Complimenting the odors
And their collection<br/>of needle-point geese.
Awkward conversations<br/>with middle-aged couples
Trying to stave off divorce.
Yeah, well,<br/>we'd better get going,
It's like a four-hour drive.
And it's supposed<br/>to rain tonight.
Or we could just stay home.
Maybe watch some tv.
Order in some chinese.
Oh, sichuan garden!
Are we really bailing?
Good, cause this<br/>thing's empty.
Hundred dollars says<br/>when you turn around,
I say "wow."
Barney, this is<br/>the third time
You've hit on me<br/>by accident.
It's one of the many risks<br/>of the blind approach.
It's usually<br/>a two-man operation
Where ted signals<br/>that the target is hot.
But ted's too busy being<br/>in a lesbian relationship.
Why don't you just check out<br/>the girl's reflection
In the bar mirror?
You can't just...
Wow!
Hey?
What's taking so long?
I have to go.
Not so fast, scherbotsky.
I like the way you think.
That mirror thing.
Simple. Elegant.
Okay, limited-time offer:
I need a "bro" for<br/>my bro-ings on about town.
How would you<br/>like to be said bro?
Well, as tempting<br/>as that sounds,
I'm hanging out<br/>with my friend
Who just got dumped.
She really needs<br/>some support...
Or a stranger's<br/>tongue down her throat.
That seems healthy.
All right.
Guess I'm in.
So...
One more week<br/>and it'll be a month.
Really? Are you sure?
Wow, that snuck up on me.
Oh, come on.
The 18th can't get here<br/>fast enough.
Wait, the 18th?
Oh, crap!
I can't believe I forgot this--
I'm going to be out of town<br/>on the 18th!
Oh.
Well, um, we can just...
I mean, the whole point was<br/>not to rush into this.
Yeah.
Or we could do it tonight.
75th and amsterdam.
I'm so glad we decided<br/>to just stay home.
Oh, I know.
Can you imagine<br/>if we'd gone?
We'd be just<br/>getting there now,
And yet we'd feel<br/>obligated to have sex.
Yeah, for 89<br/>bucks a night,<br/>we're doing it.
I would like<br/>to propose a toast.
To the most awesomely<br/>mellow anniversary ever.
Ah...
I'm so glad you have to go<br/>to your parents' next weekend.
I'm so glad your roommates<br/>are out of town.
Oh, my god, what are<br/>they doing home?
They think we went away.
Oh, it is on<br/>for my boy, ted.
But we didn't go away,<br/>we're in the bathroom.
All we have to do is<br/>hide out in here
Until ted moves his mojo<br/>into the bedroom.
But I don't want<br/>to hide out in here.
Honey, ted has been going out of<br/>his mind waiting for this.
If we go out there
And spoil the mood,<br/>it's not going to happen.
Then one of us is going<br/>to have to have<br/>sex with ted,
And...<br/>Not going to be me.
Okay, fine.
I guess I'll actually floss.
You suited up!
Well, I figured<br/>if I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do this right.
Emilio?<br/>The woman will have...
I'll have a<br/>johnny walker blue, neat,
And a montecristo no. 2
Thanks.
Ah, the no. 2,<br/>a.K.A. "the torpedo."
Or, as the rollers call it,<br/>"piramide."
My father was a cigar fanatic,
It was the only way<br/>to get his attention.
Father issues.
Hot.
I know-- I was this close<br/>to being a huge slut.
Slut would have been better,<br/>but I'll settle for bro.
Especially now that<br/>ted's with victoria
And can't drink.
Because he's pregnant.
Cause he's the girl.
Oh, come on,<br/>ted can't be pregnant.
You need to have sex<br/>to get pregnant.
What up!
Freeze frame high five!
I think this may be<br/>a perfect moment.
I wish we could<br/>hold onto it forever.
No.
Because the beauty<br/>of a moment
Is that it's fleeting.
By its very<br/>nature, it...
Slips through<br/>our fingers...
Making it that much<br/>more precious.
Ugh, that is bad.
That is, like, high-school-<br/>literary-magazine bad.
And they're not even high.
It's actually working.
Yeah, smooth but slowly.
God, close the deal, already.
It's been, like, 45 minutes--
We could have had sex<br/>three times by now.
Yeah, try five.
What up!
Maybe we should<br/>just go out there.
No way!
We can't go out there now,
They'll know that we've been<br/>sitting in the bathroom
The whole time.
It'll be too weird.
Fine.
But if we're stuck in here...
I'm turning up<br/>the volume.
Shh. Shh.
♪ ashes around me...
I want to know you.
Like, know your soul.
Ted, what makes<br/>you cry?
Could you hold my hair back,
I think I'm going<br/>to hurl.
What do you and ted usually do<br/>after the cigar bar?
Are you kidding?
Ted's never been here.
You've already
Flown higher and faster<br/>than he ever did.
Still...
What?
Eh.
There is one other thing<br/>we could do.
If you're up for it.
I had no idea laser tag<br/>still existed!
Yeah, well, enjoy it<br/>before it becomes cool again.
I give it two months.
Oh, I believe it--<br/>this is awesome!
Okay, follow my lead,<br/>stay low,
And never underestimate<br/>a 12-year-old with a...
Scherbotsky,<br/>you have to focus!
You just saved my life,<br/>didn't you?
Thank me later.
Let's keep moving.
These little bastards<br/>are everywhere.
He's just staring into her eyes.
I don't know, we used to be<br/>even more nauseatingly
Into each other<br/>than ted and victoria.
Now look at us.
Now we just make fun<br/>of people like that.
It's the circle of life.
No, I'm serious,<br/>marshall.
I mean, we couldn't even<br/>get it up to go on our big trip.
And now we're celebrating our<br/>anniversary stuck in a bathroom.
Well, it's not fair to compare<br/>us to ted and victoria.
This is their first time.
Yeah, but we could still have<br/>some more romance.
Now, you just say,<br/>"want to do it?"
And I say, "yeah."
Want to...
No!
Maybe we're just out of firsts.
Looks like they're<br/>about to have theirs.
Should we take this<br/>to the bedroom?
Yes!<br/>Yes!
Yes.
Yes!<br/>Yes!
No.
No, don't answer it!
You can answer it.
We have all night.
You're answering it?
He's answering it!<br/>No!
Do her!<br/>Do her now!
Sure.
Good luck with that.
Sorry about that.
How about a little more wine?
I'll get another bottle.
Thank you.
I need a drink.
Do we have any<br/>cough syrup in here?
Shh...
Oh, god.
These brats have us<br/>completely surrounded.
I counted nine, maybe ten.
I'll lay down some cover fire,<br/>you make a run for it.
No. Leave no man behind.
Either we all get out<br/>of here or no one does.
But I...<br/>Don't be a hero, scherbotsky.
See you on the other side.
Damn.
Want to go get a soft pretzel?
Yeah.<br/>All right.
Marshall, what happened to us?
We used to just stare into each<br/>other's eyes all night long.
Have we lost that?
Maybe.
But I think I just found it.
Right here.
Baby, I'm giving you<br/>sexy smoldering
With just a hint of crazy eyes.
Oh.
Okay, well, get ready<br/>for my sex-ray vision.
Did you remember<br/>to pick up the dry cleaning?
Oh, damn it.<br/>It's all right.
We can do this.
Let's just hold hands.
This is nice.
Oh.
You love that move.
It's a classic marshall.
All right, we totally<br/>suck at this.
We really, really need<br/>to get out of here.
Baby, there's something<br/>I have to do,
And if I do it in front of you,
It'll change the entire nature<br/>of our relationship.
What is it?
I have to pee.
This is bad.<br/>Yeah.
We've gone nine years without<br/>peeing in front of each other.
You always think<br/>there'll be more time.
Look at us.
We're basically<br/>an old married couple,
And we're not even married yet.
The flame of our romance<br/>is flickering,
And if I pee all over it,<br/>it might go out forever.
How much longer do you think<br/>you can hold it?
I drank a big gulp<br/>of mountain dew
During that quantum leap<br/>marathon.
Oh, boy.
Playing laser tag<br/>really takes me back.
You know what game<br/>I really miss? Battleship.
I've never lost a game.
Neither have I.
Of course I cheat.
Oh, yeah, me, too.
The trick is to bend
The aircraft carrier<br/>so it makes an l.
Ah. I always just stacked<br/>the ships on top of each other.
You know, we should have<br/>a cheaters grudge match.
I think I still have a...
Hello. Target acquired.
Hottie by the jukebox.
Ooh, good eye, scherbotsky.
I got someone for you.
Two o'clock, blue shirt.
That's a woman.
Oh, my mistake.
Or is it?
Let's just focus<br/>on your target.
Right.
I got this one.
Oh, my god.
I love your jeans.
Okay.
Is this a lesbian bar?
Because that girl<br/>with the blue shirt just...
Oh, no.
I am all about the dudes.
Although pickings<br/>are pretty slim tonight.
Only hot guy here is<br/>blondie in the suit,
And he's playing hard to get.
Really?
'cause he's totally<br/>vibing me right now.
Must be the jeans.
Well, jeans will only<br/>get you so far.
I'm going home with him.
We'll see about that.
Oh, my god, I hate ted.
I hate him so much.
Baby, why don't you just go?
Tons of other couples have<br/>peed in front of each other.
Because I want to keep<br/>some of the mystery alive.
Well, you have farted<br/>in front of me.
Yes, but I always<br/>cover it with a cough.
You always do.
Hey.
Hey.<br/>Let's get out of here.
Let's go somewhere else.
What happened?
Eh, you sometimes like to do
A little catch and release.
But why?
Leave no man behind.
Either we all score<br/>or no one scores.
Right on.
Hey, you want to go<br/>play battleship?<br/>Hit!
Ted, I can't wait any longer.
Should we move to the bedroom?
There's no time for that.
They can suck on each other's<br/>fingers for an hour,
But there's no time to take<br/>two steps to the bedroom?
Baby, I can't hold it in<br/>any longer.
It's time.
I know.
I love you, marshall.
I love you, lily.
There we go.
You know, barney, I had
A surprisingly good time<br/>bro-ing out tonight.
You're a better ted than ted.
Hey, in fact,
You have just earned yourself
An invite<br/>to marshall's bachelor party.
And you don't even have<br/>to come out of the cake.
Thanks.
And, um, thanks<br/>for sticking around tonight.
I hope you're ready<br/>for some hard-core battleship.
Come on, boys.
Hard-core?
That's the only way I play.
I found it.
Are you ready to...
What the hell are you doing?
I'm birthday suiting up.
I'm sorry, did you<br/>want to undress me?
No! I thought we were just<br/>hanging out as friends.
Oh, come on, you have been
Throwing yourself at me<br/>all night.
What?! I did the opposite!
I threw some other girl at you.
You invited me up to your<br/>apartment to "play battleship."
Is that not an internationally<br/>recognized term for sex?
No.
Great.
I hope you're happy.
You sunk my battleship.
I'm okay.
You okay?
I feel the same.
And yet, strangely different.
I'm happy for my bladder,<br/>yet sad for us.
You had to do it, sweetie...
For ted.
And, hey, look, at least now
We can stay in here<br/>as long as it takes.
Yeah.
I guess our relationship<br/>had to take a hit
So a new one out there<br/>could blossom.
Oh, crap!
They must have heard that.
Well, I guess we can<br/>come out now.
I don't believe it.
They're gone.
Good.
'cause I got to take a whiz.
Okay, you and me,
That's insane.
If you even thought about it<br/>for one second...
But I have thought about it,<br/>and it makes a lot of sense.
We both think the marriage<br/>commitment thing's a drag.
We both want something<br/>casual and fun.
And we clearly<br/>get along really well.
Wow, that actually did<br/>make a lot of sense.
But what about ted?
I checked with ted.
Ted, so now that things with<br/>you and victoria are going
Pretty well, I assume<br/>you're over all the girls
I take your silence as a yes,<br/>so say I were to hook up
With someone, say robin,<br/>you'd be cool with that, right?
Sure.
Good luck with that.<br/>Ha!
Totally gave us his blessing.
Really?
Really.
So ted didn't care that you<br/>wanted to make a move on me?
Didn't care at all.
Oh.
Oh...
What?
You like ted.
I didn't say I liked ted.
You like ted.
Wow.
This is huge.
Barney, I don't like ted.
He's moved on,<br/>and I'm really happy for...
Look, are we gonna play<br/>battleship or what?
You're not gonna tell him,<br/>are you?
No.
That's the bro code.
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro
That a third bro<br/>has a crush on him.
Just like the third bro<br/>doesn't tell the mutual bro
That the original bro went<br/>bare pickle in front of her.
It's quid pro bro.
A-7.
Miss.<br/>Of course.
Well, we still have<br/>one frontier left.
Still got the deuce.
Not making me feel better.
Well, it certainly was a first.
It was, wasn't it?
We still have firsts.
Of course we do.
And you know what, I actually<br/>feel closer to you now.
I want to know you.
Like, know your soul.
Marshall, what makes you cry?
This moment is fleeting
Because it's being chased<br/>by another moment.
Oh, just grab my boob already.
Come on, guys, get a room.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, something
You might not know<br/>about your uncle marshall
Is that he's always been<br/>good at games.
I mean, unbeatable.
Gin!
Yahtzee!
Poker!
You don't have<br/>to shout out "poker"
When you win.
I know. It's just fun to say.
We all finally agreed<br/>marshall should be running
Our game nights<br/>instead of playing in them.
Which he took to mean,<br/>"invent your own game."
It's called<br/>"marsh-gammon."
It combines all
The best features of<br/>all the best games--
Candy land, I never,<br/>pictionary.
Backgammon, obviously.
No. Backgammon sucks.
I took the only good part
Of backgammon,<br/>the "gammon,"
And I left the rest<br/>of it in the trash<br/>where it belongs.
I'm so excited<br/>victoria's coming.
I'm going to go get<br/>another round.
Okay, I want<br/>to lay down
Some ground<br/>rules for tonight.
Barney, I actually<br/>like victoria... A lot,
So don't say<br/>anything embarrass...
Don't say anything.
And guys,
I haven't exactly<br/>told victoria
That I used to have a<br/>kind of thing for robin,
So we you could<br/>just avoid the...
Well, well, well.
How rich.
You make me promise
To be on my best behavior<br/>around your girlfriend,
Yet, you have been lying<br/>to her since day one.
Excuse me.
Hi. Leg warehouse?
Yeah, my friend ted<br/>needs something to stand on.
So, nothing for him<br/>to stand on?
Okay, and thanks so much.
Ted, doesn't victoria<br/>deserve to know
That you once had the hots<br/>for robin?
I have half a mind to tell<br/>the story of the re-return.
No. I-I swore you<br/>to secrecy on that.
Ooh, I am smelling dirt.
What is the story<br/>of the re-return?
Nothing.<br/>It's nothing.
And speaking of<br/>digging up dirt,
Can I count on you two<br/>to behave around victoria?
Us? What would we do?
Look, um, you guys<br/>have always been<br/>like the parents
That I still have and,<br/>in fact, moved here
To get away from.
However, could we skip the<br/>traditional interrogation
Of the new<br/>girlfriend tonight?
Fine.<br/>Fine.
Thank you.
I should go help robin.<br/>Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So, are you going to be okay
Hanging out<br/>with victoria tonight?
Oh, sure. She's great.
Because of the whole thing<br/>where I said I liked ted?
No. Victoria's great.
She's fun, she's<br/>free-spirited,<br/>she's great.
I said, "she's great"<br/>too many times, didn't I?
You must really hate the bitch.
But if you roll an even number
While adjacent<br/>to the peppermint forest,
Then you "marshall out,"<br/>and all your chips go
Into the pot,<br/>and remember,
If you ever ask<br/>the question "what?," then...
You got to drink.
Got it?
Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just<br/>start, you guys'll pick it up.
Newbie goes first.
Roll.<br/>Okay.
Three!
You got autobiography.
Now, that's where you have
To answer
A personal question<br/>about your dating life
Marshall, come on.
Hey, she's the one<br/>who rolled a three.
Victoria,
Ever cheated<br/>while in a relationship?"
Wow, good question.
Look, you don't<br/>have to answer that.
It's okay.
Um, well, I was in a really<br/>crappy relationship in college,
And I wound up kissing<br/>this guy at a party
One night, and I
Felt terrible about it, so,<br/>I came clean, and we broke up.
Victoria, that was an honest<br/>and mature answer.
You may advance<br/>to the gumdrop mountains.
Ooh.
So victoria, did you ever<br/>re-return to this guy?
What?
You said "what,"<br/>you got to drink!
Oh, barney,
By the way, I<br/>went to a party
In that new<br/>building on 82nd,
And the host said she knew you.
What is her name?
Sharon? Shannon?
Shannon?!
Shannon, shannon...
No, don't remember any shannon.
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me<br/>a videotape to give...
Where's the tape?!
Fine. I'll get it.
Cool, okay.<br/>You know, whenever.
Okay, robin,<br/>your roll.
Five!
Another<br/>autobiography...
For the player to<br/>your left, which...
Victoria!
Of course.
Victoria, "how many<br/>boyfriends did you have
Before you started<br/>dating ted?"
Wait, the card<br/>actually says "ted?"
Okay,
Uh, well, boyfriends--<br/>I guess I've only had... Two.
Prude alert.
Well... That's<br/>serious boyfriends.
I've dated other guys<br/>in between.
Oh, slut alert!
Oh, great,<br/>there it is.
Thanks, lily.
You're a peach.
Oh, wow, look<br/>at that.
Robin landed on<br/>the chocolate swamp.
That's five<br/>chips for me.
Thank you!
Finally somebody<br/>understands marsh-gammon.
Barney, what was on that tape?
Too bad you'll never find out.
Oh, damn it!
If only<br/>I'd given you a fake tape
And hidden the real tape
In my purse.<br/>Oh, wait.
That's exactly what I did.
Drink!
Aah!
Yeah, you were acting so weird<br/>about it, I gave you ted's
Graduation<br/>tape instead.
So, should we pop it in?
Give it to me,<br/>give it, give me...
Play the tape,<br/>play it, play it!<br/>Ted!
Fine, fine.
You cannot<br/>play it.
Shannon!
I love you!
I love you so much.
What about us<br/>changing the world together?
Don't tell me you've forgotten.
I know I haven't.

Barney, where<br/>have you been?
Yeah, we're-we're really<br/>sorry about that.
Yeah, so sorry.
But seriously, what was up<br/>with the tape?
No, no, stay.<br/>Come on,<br/>barney.
Come on.<br/>Stay!
I'm sorry. I don't want<br/>to talk about it.
It was the most embarrassing,<br/>and humiliating thing
That ever happened to me.
Well, we all have<br/>embarrassing stories.
Sometimes it's good<br/>to-to talk about it.
Oh, really?
Then why don't you tell us
Your most humiliating moment,<br/>marshall?
Show me how good it is.
All right.
I was stopping by lily's<br/>kindergarten class to say hi,
But they were all at recess.
I really had to pee, so I went<br/>into the class's restroom.
It was a-a smaller target<br/>than I'm used to,
So I figured<br/>I should sit down.
What I didn't realize was,<br/>it was a shared bathroom.
I wish I'd pulled up my pants.
The kids still call him<br/>funny butt.
Okay. I'll tell you my story.
Believe it or not,
I was not always as awesome<br/>as I am today.
It was 1998.
I was just out of college,<br/>and I was working
At a coffeehouse<br/>with my girlfriend.
My girlfriend... Shannon.

Sorry, I only give high twos.
Whatevs. As long<br/>as you're nailing that.
Listen to you.
"that"?
You know, women aren't objects.
They're human beings.
And fyi,
Shannon and I have decided
To wait till we're married.
You can read about it<br/>in my zine.
Hey, haircut, right here.
Open up your<br/>knowledge basket,
'cause here it comes.
Forget that touchy-feely crap.
You get money, you get laid.<br/>End of discussion.
I feel sorry for you, man.
Peace out, hombre.
Suits.
Five weeks later,<br/>we were all set
To leave<br/>for the peace corps.
Only problem was...
She never showed up.
She never showed?
So, what happened next?
You know what?
This was a mistake.<br/>Wait. Uh...
What if somebody else told<br/>their most humiliating story?
Oh, I know just<br/>how to decide who.
You brought the game<br/>to the bar?
We're not quitting just<br/>'cause ted's so far ahead.
I was winning?
Fine. I'll go next.
I was doing a report<br/>on live tv
About a hansom cabdriver.
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop<br/>story!
Yeah, we all know that one.
Okay, how<br/>about this?
I will tell you my<br/>most humiliating story.
Yeah, victoria,<br/>way to step up!
Okay, it involves a<br/>game of truth or dare,
A squeeze-bottle<br/>of marshmallow ice<br/>cream topping,
And the hot tub
At my grandparents'<br/>retirement community.
Kids, I tell you a lot<br/>of inappropriate stories,
But there's no way in hell<br/>I'm telling you this one.
Don't worry, though,<br/>it wasn't that great.
That is the<br/>greatest story ever!
Oh, my god!
Wow, wow!
Victoria, I deem<br/>your offering... Worthy.
My saga... Continues.
I went back to the coffeehouse<br/>to find shannon.
Barney.
Sugar bear,<br/>where were you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
My dad won't let me go.
But the nicaraguans need us!
It's just, he's still<br/>supporting me, and...
Look, he's coming by soon<br/>to talk about it, but
I think you should go on<br/>without me.
Shannon, there is no...<br/>Barney,
It's your dream.
It's only two years.
I know we can make it.
As I walked away, I realized<br/>shannon was an adult.
Her father couldn't control<br/>her life.
I had to go back<br/>and confront him.
She was in the middle
Of a heated argument<br/>with her dad.
What?!
Now we all got to drink.
Oh, my god.
What happened next?
I don't know, guys.
Okay, okay.
Marshall's mom<br/>sent us cookies...
Lily, no!
For the team, marshall,<br/>for the team.
Hey, mrs. Eriksen, it's lily.
Thank you so much<br/>for the delicious cookies.
Mayonnaise.
Really?
Never would have guessed.
Well, I will definitely<br/>give marshall a kiss for you.
Okay. Take care.
Oh, crap.
My mom sent cookies?
Yeah.
I wish we had a dog,<br/>so they wouldn't go to waste.
So we've got the whole<br/>place to ourselves.
I'm thinking
Floor sex.<br/>Sounds reasonable.
Ooh, floor's cold.
Grab that afghan your mom made.
The whole time?
The... Whole... Time.
Barney, that was really<br/>embarrassing for both of us.
We just earned a<br/>huge chunk of story.
Right.
So where was I?
Oh, yeah.
Shannon was sucking face<br/>with her dad.
How can...
With your dad?
I mean, I know
Judge not lest ye be judged,<br/>but gross!
Barney, that's not my dad.
His name's greg. I've been<br/>seeing him for a few weeks.
I was hoping you'd just leave,<br/>and we could avoid all this.
We're breaking up?
But what about the peace corps?
Yeah, all this granola business,<br/>it was just a phase.
Greg's older.
He's successful.
He buys me all this cool stuff.
But I love you.
But he has a boat.
You should go<br/>to the peace corps
And forget about me.
I didn't go.
That night, I recorded my video<br/>and mailed it to shannon.
I didn't see her<br/>until a week later.
There's sugar in the basket.
Shannon!
Shannon, you came back!
I'm just picking up<br/>my last paycheck.
Oh.
Did you... Did you get my tape?
Oh, she got the tape.
You?
It was you?
♪ will I ever see<br/>another rainbow? ♪
Oh, you poor thing.
The story's not over.
I did see shannon one more time.
When?
Sorry.
You've got to tell us.
I don't know,<br/>I think I might need
One last story<br/>to get me through it.
Fine.
Um... Oh!
The green testicle story.
So I was playing<br/>ultimate frisbee in college
And there was this barefoot dude<br/>with weirdly sharp toenails...
Oh, come on, ted!
You know what story<br/>I want to hear.
Everyone else here
Has manned up tonight<br/>and told the truth.
Why can't you?
You're right.
Victoria, I'm sorry<br/>I haven't told you this yet,
But a while back,<br/>I was kind of into robin.
In fact, on our first date,
I might have said, "I love you."
Understandably,<br/>she freaked out and I left.
But unfortunately,
The night did not end there.
We all ended up at the bar<br/>with our cabdriver ranjit.
To one hell of a night!
And I drank...
A lot.
So you guys think<br/>I should have kissed her?
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go kiss her<br/>right... Now.
Yes! Do it!
To the cab.
Hello?
Is someone out there?
You ralphed and ran?
I thought you were<br/>vomit-free since '93.
So that was a lie?
You re-returned for me.
That's really sweet.
Though you kind of ruined my<br/>customized scherbotsky doormat.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Victoria, I know<br/>this must be...
Yeah.
It kind of is.
Wow, ted, you were right.
You shouldn't have<br/>told that story.
But you did earn yourself<br/>the right to the end of mine.
We fast-forward<br/>eight years into the future.
Wait, eight years,<br/>that's, that's this year.
Marshall, not only is it<br/>this year, it's tonight.
Hi.
Barney?
Hi, shannon.
What are you doing here?
Just listen.
When you left me<br/>for that guy greg,
It changed me.
Now I'm this.
I-I know this is crazy.
It's just, you were once<br/>such a big part of my life.
And it just seemed insane that<br/>you didn't know who I am now.
So here I am.
And then she told me<br/>about her life.
She and greg dated for a while<br/>and then split up.
But here's<br/>the real kicker:
Shannon's a mom.
She has a little kid named max.
That's crazy.
That could have been my kid.
But instead, what do I have?
My whole life's<br/>some money in the bank,
Some suits in my closet and<br/>a string of one-night stands.
Hey.
Come on.<br/>I mean, just because
Her life went one way<br/>and yours went another,
It doesn't make<br/>your life any worse.
My life rocks!
Money, suits and sex.
These are tears of joy!
In some tiny apartment changing<br/>some brat's poopy diapers.
But instead, I'm out in the<br/>world being awesome 24-7, 365!
You let me dodge a bullet,<br/>big guy.
Plus, here's the mini-cherry<br/>on top of the regular cherry
On top of the sundae of<br/>awesomeness that is my life.
After shannon and I talked,<br/>I nailed her.
Nope.<br/>Yeah.
Sorry. Don't buy it.<br/>You're making it up.
You're just trying
To cover the fact<br/>that you actually had
A profound moment of doubt
About yourself and...
Oh, my god.
Oh, barney!
Video's pretty good<br/>on this phone, huh?
Is your phone on?
Oh, no. It just takes a while
To power down.
Ew, gross.
Just stop it.
Ladies, gentlemen...
Ted.
This has been
A wonderful evening.
I got great dirt<br/>on all you guys.
I got ted to tell the re-return.
I finally nailed shannon!
Told her I'd call her tomorrow.<br/>Yeah, right.
And I rediscovered just how<br/>awesomely awesome my life is.
Peace out, hombres!
I think barney just<br/>won game night.
We spend so much effort
Trying to keep<br/>parts of our lives hidden,
Even from our closest friends.
But those rare times<br/>when we do open up,
It's amazing how minor those<br/>secrets all end up seeming.
♪ right? Right?
♪ you've got to want
♪ to rearrange
♪ and keep it off the record
♪ off the record

Of course, not every secret<br/>was told that night.
But that's getting<br/>ahead of the story.

Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.
No thanks, dude.
Noon?<br/>Noon.
Okay.<br/>See you then.
Hey, girls.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Hey. I'm on my<br/>way to meet ted.
It's our two<br/>monthiversary, so we're
Going out to dinner.
Great! Well, that answers
All the questions I didn't ask.
Robin!
Oh, come on.<br/>We bust on each other.
We're just at that place<br/>in our strong friendship.
Really? Oh.
Get off me.
Oh, see? I did it again.
What are you guys up to?<br/>Oh, dress shopping.
You know, I make wedding cakes<br/>for a lot of fancy bridal shops.
If you want,<br/>I could take you shopping,
Maybe get you a discount.<br/>Really? That'd be great.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Huh. I should<br/>take this.
Hello.
Hey,
I thought it was going<br/>to be just us tomorrow.
What's with inviting<br/>punky brewster?
Robin, you've got to get over<br/>this ted and victoria thing.
You had your chance,<br/>and now he's moved on.
Can't you just be happy<br/>for them?
The best I can give you<br/>is a fake smile and dead eyes.
Sold.
Victoria, what's wrong?
I've just been offered<br/>a fellowship
At a culinary institute<br/>in germany.
Wait. Germany, europe?
It's for two years.
I figured I didn't have<br/>much of a chance,
'cause they don't let<br/>many americans in, but...
I'm in.
So, this is the europe germany?
What other germany<br/>would it be?
The one in epcot?
Ted.
Sorry.
Congratulations.
Thank you. I don't<br/>know if I'm going to go.
Mm-hmm. And if-if you do,<br/>what does that mean for us?
I don't know.
I just... I don't think
That long distance<br/>really works for anyone.
Oh, god, no.
Long-distance is a lie<br/>teenagers tell each other
To get laid<br/>the summer before college.
So, that leaves<br/>us with...
Either you stay here,
Or we break up.
Wow.
Um, look, let's just see<br/>how things progress,
And if by September,<br/>we still feel...
I have to<br/>leave on Monday.
Monday, September the...?
Ted.
Do you have any thoughts?
Maybe we should each take<br/>some time
To think about what we want.
We'll meet up tomorrow<br/>to discuss it.
It's a date.
And that's<br/>when things got complicated.
Hey, baby,<br/>how's the dress place?
Everything's so<br/>fluffy and white.
It's like shopping<br/>in a marshmallow.
How's barney's<br/>tailor?
Um, everything here is dark
And sketchy and seems illegal.
It's like shopping<br/>in barney's mind.
Well, good<br/>luck, baby.
Bye.
Hey, barney,
I'm not sure about this.
A tailor in the back room<br/>of a pet store?
Look, do you want<br/>a quality suit and a<br/>free rabbit or not?
Okay.
Ted, sergei says<br/>stop moping around.
You're distracting<br/>him from his process.
You speak ukrainian?
Eh.
Guys, I'm kind of<br/>screwed here.
I don't want to lose victoria,
But I can't ask her to stay<br/>just for me.
And long distance definitely<br/>isn't an option.
No. No, no, no. No way.
You know who likes<br/>long distance?
Girls. It's all talking<br/>and no sex.
Kill me now.
Don't knock long-distance<br/>relationships.
I really think they can work.
Really? You?
Absolutely.
I'm juggling<br/>four right now.
There's lisa in madrid,<br/>there's erica in tokyo,
There's laura in denmark,
And kelly on 34th street.
The lass thinks I'm a humble<br/>sheep shearer from killarney.
Ted, do you<br/>remember in college
When lily did that summer<br/>art program in paris?
Yeah.<br/>Well, she kept talking about<br/>this cheesy french guy, gabriel.
So, I went out to visit,<br/>and there was this party.
And who shows up<br/>but gabriel.
And he's got this<br/>weak-ass, thin<br/>french mustache.
I'm not much of a fighter,<br/>but I knew I could take
This weird little dude.
So, I took him aside,
And I got all creepy quiet,<br/>I got the crazy eyes going,
And I said,
"you stay away from<br/>lily, or I swear to god
I'll eat that mustache right<br/>off of your ugly french face."
Yeah. No, he literally<br/>ran away.
I think he was crying.
I never told lily about it.
To be honest,<br/>I'm not very proud of it.
To be even more honest,
I am.
Um, other than confirming a lot<br/>of european stereotypes
About americans, did that<br/>little story have a point?
Yeah, the point is that even<br/>though lily is my soul mate,
Long distance still<br/>almost killed us.
If you think that<br/>there's any chance
That victoria<br/>is your soul mate,
You should ask her to stay.
Well, I don't know if she is.
It's still too early,<br/>but yeah, she could be.
Oh, please. You<br/>barely know this girl.
What's her favorite color?
Is she a cat person<br/>or a dog person?
Is she open<br/>to a three-way?
Ted, I do more research than<br/>this before buying a cell phone.
And fyi, yes, I have<br/>three-way calling.
Look, she can't be a cat person.
I'm a dog person, I'm attracted<br/>to other dog people.
Are you sure?
All right.
Hello.<br/>Hey, random question.
How do you<br/>feel about cats?
Cats. Hated the musical,<br/>love the animal.
Good to know.
Um, okay.<br/>Good-bye.
She's a cat person.
I don't know this girl at all.
Oh, excellent.<br/>We'll take this one.<br/>Yes. Mm-hmm.
Whoa. Hey, hey,<br/>it's my suit.
Shouldn't I be the one<br/>to choose?
Here. Play with<br/>this pin cushion.
Oh.
Okay.
God.
I'm going to look hot.
Marshall, I can't let you waste<br/>a suit this nice
Fighting a losing battle<br/>for our planet's survival.
This is a suit for winners.
I am getting you an<br/>interview at my office.
We need good men like you<br/>in our legal department.
We get sued a lot.
No way.
The kid does not sell out.
Oh, come on, dude! Three<br/>months working with me,
You'll make more than<br/>lily makes in a year.
No. I've made my decision.
So have I.
If I ask this girl<br/>to give up her dreams for me,
And two weeks later,<br/>it's not working out,
I'm, like, the biggest jerk<br/>of all time.
It's just too much pressure<br/>on a new relationship.
I'm going to tell her to go.
And so I met her that night<br/>to tell her my decision.
All right, I've<br/>been thinking a<br/>lot about this...
Okay, before you say anything,
I wanted to give you...
This.
This is what happens<br/>when you, you know,
Let them finish baking.
I want you to stay.
Everything here is dark
And sketchy<br/>and seems illegal.
It's like shopping<br/>in barney's mind.
Oh, good luck, baby.
Bye.
Now, what sort of dress<br/>did you have in mind, dear?
Nothing too<br/>huge or-or poofy.
I'm not really<br/>a girlie girl.
But I would like to look<br/>like a beautiful princess.
I saw a couple up<br/>front that were nice.
By the window?
Mm.
No offense, dear,
But those are a little<br/>out of your price range.
Where does she get off?
She doesn't know<br/>how much money I make.
Oh, these women are experts.
They can guess<br/>your net annual income
Just by looking<br/>at your underwear.
Damn you old navy and your<br/>reasonably-priced three-packs!
At least we get free champagne!
And cake.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Speaking of which,
Victoria, have you<br/>decided what to do
About your doughnut<br/>fellowship?
You know, I don't know.<br/>I mean, I want to go,
But I don't want<br/>to lose ted.
I even thought<br/>about long distance, as if
That ever works.
Ugh. All talking and no sex.
Kill me now.
I know it sounds lame,
But I actually think<br/>that ted might be the one.
That's pretty hard
To walk away from.
Well, I don't know.
I'd feel a little stepford<br/>turning down a huge opportunity
To chase some guy<br/>I'd only known two months.
But this isn't just some guy.
This is ted.
He's amazing.
He's the best guy I know.
Yeah, in america,<br/>but german guys? Whew!
I would let them bread<br/>my schnitzel any day,
If you know what I mean.
I really don't...
Sex.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
This bastard's kicked.
Thanks.
Oh!
Oh!
It's okay, guys, I hate it.
Just horrible.<br/>It's bad, it's really bad.
Short in front,<br/>long in the back?
That is the mullet<br/>of wedding dresses.
You know, victoria,
Marshall and I did<br/>long distance once.
In college, I did
An art course in paris.
I was the only american there.
It was really lonely.
I only had<br/>one friend,
Gabrielle.
She was kind of homely<br/>and strange-looking,
And she was really<br/>self-conscious
About this little mustache<br/>she had.
Anyway,
Halfway through the semester,<br/>she just stopped talking to me,
And I never figured out why.
And then I had nobody.
The only thing<br/>that got me through
Was knowing that my soul mate<br/>was back at home waiting for me.
If ted's your soul mate, then
It may be worth it<br/>to hang onto him.
But how am I supposed to know<br/>if we're soul mates?
It's too soon.
Ooh. Speak of the devil.
Hello.
Hey, random question.
How do you feel<br/>about cats?
Cats. Hated the musical,<br/>love the animal.
A cat person.
Why am I not surprised?
Bye.
Why does ted want to know<br/>if I like cats?
Maybe he's going<br/>to buy you one.
I did hear barking<br/>in the background.
Maybe he was in a pet store.
Does he want us<br/>to get a cat together?
Maybe he's using<br/>an adorable kitty
To guilt you into staying.
That is low.
Do you really think<br/>that's what he's doing?
Oh, I wouldn't even<br/>wait to find out.
I would be on the<br/>next plane to germany.
Aw.
Oh, god,
You guys are sucky liars.
Ugly, ugly, ugly.<br/>I don't know<br/>what to say.
You know what?
We're doing this<br/>all wrong.
I am going to get you<br/>one of those
Front window dresses,<br/>just for fun.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Okay.
Just kind of seemed<br/>like you're trying
To hustle victoria<br/>out of the country.
I'm not, I'm just trying<br/>to support her.
She got a super-important<br/>dessert scholarship.
Stop being sarcastic.
It is a super-important<br/>dessert scholarship.
Wow, that's hard to say<br/>without sounding sarcastic.
Look...
I know you're not<br/>victoria's biggest fan,
But she seems to make ted happy.
So think about that
Before you use your miles<br/>to buy her a plane ticket.
Somebody say
"beautiful princess."
Oh, my gosh,<br/>it's perfect! Oh!
This dress is totally going to<br/>get me laid on my wedding night.
Oh, look how happy she is.
You know, I've always<br/>thought of myself
As one of those<br/>independent women
Who would never let any<br/>guy mess with my career.
And now I'm actually<br/>thinking about it.
I feel guilty, like it's<br/>un-feminist or something.
I know what you mean.
You do?
Well, I'm always putting<br/>my career
Ahead of my relationships,<br/>and... To be honest,
There's a lot of lonely nights<br/>in that job description.
See, that's what<br/>I'm afraid of.
Choosing ted over your career<br/>doesn't make you un-feminist.
Maybe it just means<br/>that you guys
Would be happy together.
Robin...
I think that you<br/>are the coolest.
I'm so glad that we're friends.
Oh, no way-- you're the coolest.
No, you are.
Okay, I am.
I'm going to stay.
Aw.
Oh, I am so beautiful!
Oh, don't tell me<br/>how much it costs.
Just snap my neck now,<br/>so I can die this pretty.
Wow, you look<br/>incredible.
Okay, okay, how much is it,
On a scale of never<br/>to never ever?
Never ever, ever,<br/>ever, ever...
Times infinity.
Well, it's okay.
You know,<br/>what makes a bride beautiful
Is that she's just happy<br/>to be getting married.
Oh, guys, I know I look amazing,<br/>but the important thing
Is that marshall<br/>and I love each other, right?
Yes, you're right.
But also... You just<br/>sat down in the cake.
But, you<br/>know what?
It's going<br/>to come out
Because it's only...<br/>Chocolate and raspberry.
Okay.
Come on, get up,<br/>let us see how bad it is.
It was like this<br/>when I found it?
And how will you be paying<br/>for this?
Credit card... S.
I wanted to give you...
This.
This is what happens when you...
You know,<br/>let them finish baking.
I want you to stay.
I have to go to germany.
You're going?<br/>Yes. I have to.
So that's what you decided?
Well, no-- I mean,<br/>I actually came here tonight
Leaning toward staying, but<br/>when you just told me to stay,
It made me realize<br/>that I have to go.
What is this,<br/>opposite day or something?
No.<br/>So it is?
Ted, we've only been dating<br/>for two months.
I can't let you<br/>make this decision for me.
I was totally going<br/>to tell you to go,
But then you gave me<br/>this cupcake,
And it reminded me<br/>how great you are.
Well, is there any chance
That you would move<br/>to germany with me?
Well, that's just crazy.
Oh, okay.
So it's fine for me to make<br/>sacrifices for you,
But for you it's crazy.
But you have a job here and a<br/>life; I'd have nothing there.
You'd have me.<br/>We've only been dating<br/>two months.
Oh, it's not fair.
It's not fair<br/>that we have to break up.
I hate this.
So... We're breaking up?
I guess so.
I guess so.
God, that sucks, man.
I'm so sorry.
It was just too much<br/>pressure too soon.
I mean, maybe<br/>it was silly
To even think...
Yes, marshall, I see<br/>your new suit, and it's awesome.
Well, thank you<br/>for acknowledging it.
It was weird that you hadn't.
Look, I understand
That you guys had to break up<br/>eventually, but why today?
She's leaving tomorrow.
Yeah, but she's still in town.
Yeah, she...<br/>She's still in town.
Yeah, so you spend one more<br/>amazing day together.
Ted, think about it this way:
If you knew that you were going<br/>to lose your leg tomorrow,
Would you sit on the couch<br/>and cry about it,
Or would you run, and jump,<br/>and do some awesome air kicks
While you still could?
Awesome air kicks, huh?
New pajama bottoms?
You know it.
So we can sit<br/>around and cry,
Or we can run, and<br/>do awesome air kicks
Before our leg<br/>gets chopped off.
Wait, so we're<br/>sharing the leg?
No, the leg<br/>is a metaphor.
How could the leg be well enough<br/>to do awesome air kicks one day,
And yet still so sick it needs<br/>to be chopped off the next?
I don't know, ted.
Come on, we've<br/>had a good run.
Why end on a fight?
Well, what would you<br/>want to do?
Let's do all the stuff<br/>we talked about doing<br/>and never got around to.
Yeah, we'll walk across<br/>the brooklyn bridge.
See some monkeys<br/>at the zoo?
Go to that french-vietnamese<br/>place we keep passing
And say we want to try?
Wow! We better get going.
Yeah, big day.<br/>Yeah.
And, kids,
That's exactly what we did<br/>with our last day.
The museum, the bridge,<br/>the restaurant,
And all of those nice things.
Lily, you have<br/>to tell him.
That dress cost a fortune.
No, I'm just gonna wait<br/>for the next time
Marshall really screws up,
And then, I'll just<br/>slip this in,
And it won't seem<br/>so bad by comparison.
Well, here's hoping<br/>he cheats on you.
Yeah, but only, like,<br/>second base.
Look at us: Two<br/>guys in suits.
You feel that<br/>slight tingle?
That's every girl in<br/>the bar wanting you,
And every guy<br/>wanting to be you.
Actually,<br/>it's mostly me,
But you're getting<br/>some of the splash.
Hey, babe.
Dollar beer night, so I splurged<br/>and got us each our own.
So, have you
Thought more about coming<br/>to work for barney corp?
Oh, please-- your company<br/>is not called barney corp.
Yet.
Oh, I almost<br/>forgot.
Sergei sent me your bill.
B... Barney, this says $4,000.
I thought you said<br/>that it was one-third price.
Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit.
Oh, well, guess you'll<br/>have to come work at my company.
You set this up!
You set this<br/>whole thing up!
I most certainly did...
Well, it won't work.
Even if I have to get<br/>two extra night jobs,
I'll pay your precious tailor.
I'm not selling my soul.
Baby, I know that this<br/>will make things harder,
But I will make<br/>it work, I promise.
I destroyed an $8,000<br/>wedding dress.
What time is the interview?
9:00 a.M., and you'll need<br/>new shoes.
Don't worry, I know a guy.
Well, I'm glad we<br/>got to spent the day
Doing awesome<br/>air kicks.
Yeah, I was almost too tired<br/>for all the sex.
I'm going to<br/>miss you so much.
I'm going to<br/>miss you, too.
Hey, you know, I mean,<br/>if, when I get back,
We're still<br/>single, we can...
Even if we're not.
Okay.
Look, I know it never works<br/>for anyone, but...
...Do you want to try<br/>long distance?
Yes. Yes!
We can beat the odds.
Odds, schmodds.
It's gonna work.
We're going<br/>to make it work-- it'll work.
Long-distance was<br/>and is a terrible idea,
Just awful.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED; When your Uncle Marshall<br/>was 10 years old,
he read a book called<br/>Life Among The Gorillas.
It was written by an anthropologist<br/>named Dr, Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,
and it told the story of the year she spent
living among the western lowland gorillas<br/>of Cameroon,
When Dr, Birnholz-Vazquez
came to the local community college<br/>to give a lecture,
Marshall, the youngest member<br/>of the audience,
raised his hand with a question,
What advice do you have<br/>for a budding anthropologist?
So, you want to be an anthropologist?
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live<br/>with the gorillas just like you did.
OLDER TED; What she said next<br/>changed his life,
Oh, that's wonderful,<br/>but I'm afraid you can't.
They'll all be dead by then.
And if economic sanctions<br/>and trade restrictions aren't enforced,
the destruction of the rainforests<br/>will continue,
and over a million species<br/>will be wiped out.
So you don't want coffee?
I'm saying that the coffee industry<br/>is causing irreversible...
- All right, I'm pouring it out.<br/>- Okay, one cup.
Kid needs to be alert.<br/>First day on the job and everything.
Still can't believe you're going<br/>all corporate on us.
The Kid has become the man.
Okay, it's just an internship<br/>to make a little money.
After law school,<br/>I'm still gonna work for the NRDC.
They're gonna stop global warming.
OLDER TED; Well, I mean,<br/>they did their best,
Here's your sack lunch.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay. I love you because, one,<br/>you made me a sack lunch,
and, two, you laugh<br/>every time you say the word "sack."
(CHUCKLES)
- I love you, Marshmallow.<br/>- I love you.
TED: I love you, too, Marshmallow.
Uh-oh.
- Ted?<br/>- Oh, no!
- No, she didn't.<br/>- Yeah. Yeah, she did.
Another care package?
OLDER TED; Another care package,
I'd been in a long-distance relationship<br/>with Victoria for nearly a month,
Long-distance relationships are a bad idea,
- How many is that so far?<br/>- Three.
And how many have you sent her?
In the mail or in my mind? Zero.
She's up three-zip.
Oh! Cupcakes. Great.
I bet they're delicious, too.
Yeah. They're delicious.
Damn it!
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.
God, I hate myself right now.
God, that is so me at 15.
OLDER TED; Marshall was going to work<br/>for a big corporation called Altrucel,
Altrucel was most well-known<br/>for making the yellow fuzzy stuff
on the surface of tennis balls,
I mean, this was a huge company,<br/>so they did other things,
But mostly, they wanted the public<br/>to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff,
Anyway, Marshall managed to score<br/>an internship in their legal department
because he knew someone<br/>who worked there,
(PHONE RINGING)
Go for Barney.
Mr, Stinson,<br/>this is Willis from lobby security,
Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports<br/>of a Sasquatch loose in the building,
- A Sasquatch?<br/>- That's right, sir, A Bigfoot,
We don't want to alarm you,<br/>but he's been spotted on your floor,
(BARNEY LAUGHING)
Yes! Look at you.
You're suited in an unmistakably<br/>upward direction.
Whoa! That is a butt-Ioad<br/>of motivational posters.
Yeah. Hell, yeah. I got them all.<br/>"Teamwork, courage, awesomeness."
- There's one for awesomeness?<br/>- Yeah. I had it made.
- Sit.<br/>- Hey, so, now that I'm working here,
are you finally gonna tell me<br/>exactly what your job is?
(LAUGHING) Please.
- My dawg!<br/>- My dawg!
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall.<br/>These guys are in legal.
You're gonna be working with them.
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.
- Nice tie. Steak sauce.<br/>- Oh, steak sauce. For true, though.
- Where? I don't see any...<br/>- Marshall, sidebar.
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1.<br/>A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.
Okay, Eriksen. Let's get to work.<br/>It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.
Ding-dong. What? The doorbell?
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba,<br/>in a trench coat and nothing else.
But wait. Knock, knock.<br/>Somebody's at the back door?
- I don't have a back door, so...<br/>- Oh, my gosh.
Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.
Two Jessicas. You gotta pick one.<br/>What do you do? Go.
Right, well, I'm engaged, so...
Fianc?e's out of town.<br/>What do you do? Go!
We're still engaged, even if she's out...
Okay, fianc?e's dead. Hit by a bus.<br/>What do you do? Go.
- Mmm.<br/>- Mmm.
- Sure you don't want one?<br/>- How many of those have you eaten?
Fourteen.
No. Just four.
- And the icing from two more.<br/>- Mmm.
So, anyway. Here's the problem.
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.
Anyway, I got the care package<br/>and it's just great.
Here, listen.
(MOANING IN SATISFACTION)
So, I'm standing there,
my mouth full of this delicious,<br/>relationship-winning cupcake,
and I said something dumb.
Oh, and don't worry. Yours is in the mail.<br/>I sent it a couple days ago.
And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.
Why did I say that?<br/>I think frosting makes me lie.
Oh, Teddy boy.
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her,<br/>she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.
So, that's the problem. You work on that.<br/>I'm gonna eat this cupcake.
All right, here's what you do.
Put together a care package of stuff<br/>from New York.
Some H&amp;H Bagels,<br/>an Empire State Building key chain,
and then, top off the package<br/>with a New York Times, ready?
From three days ago.
- That's brilliant.<br/>- Mmm.
You're brilliant.
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,
I was coming to Marshall and Lily<br/>for advice on how to impress you.
That is funny.
OLDER TED; And here's why it was funny,
Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,
here's what Robin was saying to Lily<br/>about me,
Okay, fine! I have feelings for him.
Now, it's ironic the girl I used to like<br/>is helping me impress the girl I now like.
The irony is clear, Ted.
- Hey! How was your first day?<br/>- I don't want to talk about it.
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.
- What?<br/>- They're jerks.
- Well, what makes them jerks?<br/>- Forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
Well, like today at lunch.
What you got there, Eriksen?<br/>Mommy pack your lunch?
(LAUGHING)
For your information, my fianc?e did.
Oh! Does she cut the crusts<br/>off your sandwich, too?
(BILSON LAUGHING)
No.
- What's that?<br/>- Nothing. Give it!
"Dear Marshmallow, good luck today.<br/>I love you! Lilypad."
Give it!
"P.S. If you've unfolded this note,<br/>your kiss already got out. Quick, catch it!"
Give it back! Hey, give it! Give me!<br/>Give it!
- Oh, screw those guys. We're adorable.<br/>- I know.
God! It's like freshman year, all over again.
Only, this time, my sweet dance moves<br/>aren't gonna be enough to win them over.
Not even Old Reliable.
Sweetie, it would be cool<br/>to have some extra money,
but if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.
- I quit.<br/>- What? No. You...
We're having so much fun.<br/>You, me, working together. It's great.
We're not even working together, Barney.<br/>I'm in the legal department and you're...
- Seriously, what is it that you do?<br/>- Please.
I'm sorry. Dude, this corporate thing,<br/>it's just... It's not for me.
No, of course it's not for you.
It's for Lily.
- What?<br/>- Marshall, Lily's a catch.
But do you really think you're gonna<br/>hang on to a girl that great
- without the package?<br/>- The package?
The package. The house, the car,<br/>sending your kids to a great school.
- A vacation once in a while.<br/>- Lily doesn't care about that stuff.
Well, no. Now she doesn't.
But how's she gonna feel<br/>in a couple of years
when she's supporting you<br/>on a kindergarten-teacher's salary,
while you're off in court,
defending some endangered<br/>South American flying beaver.
I know.
- She'll be happy.<br/>- Okay.
But will you be happy,
knowing you could have<br/>made her a lot happier?
And all four are totally naked.<br/>You gotta choose one.
What do you do? Go.
I guess, uh, Bea Arthur.
(IMITATING BUZZER SOUNDING)
Wrong. Betty White.
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.
So, did she get<br/>the awesome care package, yet?
Yep. Yesterday.
- Did she love it?<br/>- Oh, she loved it.
So, what's the problem?
So, I was talking to her last night,<br/>and I should tell you,
we've been talking on the phone<br/>every other night,
for, like, an hour and a half.<br/>Eventually, you just run out of stuff to say.
What did you have for lunch today?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, rye bread.
Oh.
(SIGHING)
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Oh, Teddy boy.
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend,
but this never-seeing-each-other thing,<br/>it's a bitch.
Maybe it just can't be done.
I think it's clear what I have to do.
It's pretty clear.
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.
Totally what I was thinking.<br/>Get out of my head, man.
Barney, how do I get these idiots<br/>to leave me alone?
Marshall, consider the penguins.
- The penguins?<br/>- On the wall.
"Conformity. It's the one who's different<br/>that gets left out in the cold."
This is a motivational poster?
Look at yourself, Marshall.<br/>You're not happy.
And you know why?<br/>Because you're different.
Now, I suppose you could learn<br/>to love yourself
for the unique little snowflake<br/>that you are.
Or you could change<br/>your entire personality,
which is just so much easier.
Change your personality? That is so awful.<br/>And not at all motivational.
Not necessarily.<br/>Okay, at first, I was appalled.
But then I realized
it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez<br/>in Life Among The Gorillas,
No, I have to gain the acceptance<br/>of the herd
by behaving exactly like one of them.
It's an anthropological study.<br/>Isn't that cool?
Well, it sounds kind of like peer pressure.
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological.
And it's cool. And I'm doing it.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure.<br/>We have an assembly every year.
I'm portraying someone<br/>who succumbs to peer pressure.
All right.
But if those guys try to pressure you<br/>to smoke, what do you say?
- Only when I'm drunk.<br/>- Good boy.
OLDER TED; And so,<br/>to fit in with the gorillas,
Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,
And that meant gorilla lessons,
Okay. I'm psyched about this.<br/>But if I'm gonna mentor you,
I need to know<br/>you're psyched about this, too.
Oh, I am. I'm psyched.
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it.<br/>It's another thing to show it.
Show it.
I'm psyched.
What was that?
Marshall, I should feel<br/>tremors of psychetude
rock my body like a seizure.
That was like a declawed, pregnant cat<br/>on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly
on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
- Wow, that was really specific.<br/>- Show me you're psyched!
Let's do this!
- That hurt!<br/>- So badly!
And then you slip it to the guy<br/>with a discreet handshake,
- and he'll get it done.<br/>- Right.
Get what done?
- Whatever.<br/>- Cool. And what guy is this?
- There's always a guy.<br/>- Okay. All right. I, uh...
- I think I'm ready.<br/>- You sure?
You want to practice your story<br/>one more time?
All right.
So, dude, check it. I'm in San Diego<br/>with two of my brosephs from Kappa,
and they're all,<br/>"Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs!"
So, I'm like, "A-snappa-doo!"
So we find this choice nudie nest<br/>near the airport.
And that is when the bouncer<br/>kicked us out.
Now, I have no idea<br/>if Svetlana ever got her green card,
but, dudes, fake diamond ring?
Worth every penny, bro.
Eriksen, that was steak sauce!
- Awesome, bro.<br/>- Yeah. Yeah.
- Get out!<br/>- Great story.
OLDER TED; The next morning,<br/>I was about to buy my ticket to Germany,
when I got an e-mail,
Uh-oh.
"Hey, Ted.<br/>Sorry I missed your call last night.
"This long-distance thing sucks, huh?
"Listen, I've been thinking<br/>and I really need to talk to you tonight.
"I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."
- So?<br/>- So, she's gonna dump me.
Has anyone ever said,<br/>"Listen, I've been thinking,"
and then followed it up<br/>with something good?
It's not like, "Listen, I've been thinking,<br/>Nutter Butters are an underrated cookie."
What else could it be?
What could she possibly have to say to me<br/>that she couldn't write in an e-mail?
I cut off all my fingers.
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it.<br/>You know it. She knows it.
I would bet you a gazillion dollars.<br/>No, I'm even more confident.
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars<br/>that she's not calling to break up with you.
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.
So I should still buy<br/>that plane ticket, right?
I'd wait.
MARSHALL: 'Sup, Blauman. E-Bomb here.
We still on for karaoke?
Dope!
I'm gonna rock you on the mike so hard<br/>your ears are gonna bleed gravy.
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.
Okay.
- What do you think?<br/>- Steak sauce.
- Steak sauce?<br/>- Yeah.
Yeah, look, you know,
whatever anthropology you do at work<br/>is your business.
But, please,<br/>don't act like that around here.
Lily, when Doctor Aurelia Birnholz...
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline<br/>came home from the gorillas,
she didn't run around<br/>picking nits out of people's hair
and throwing feces.
I'm begging you. Just leave it at the office.
Why?
Because you're acting<br/>like one of those guys,
and those guys are lame.
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes.<br/>But they're actually good guys,
and if you got to know them,<br/>then you would see that.
Look, come karaoke with us tonight,
and you'll see how totally<br/>not that lame they are.
- Okay?<br/>- Okay.
But, wait. Knock, knock, back door.
Who's there?<br/>Angelina Jolie, wait, in a wheelchair.
What do you do? Go.
Dude, Scarlett Johansson with no arms<br/>any day of the week!
(LILY FEIGNING LAUGHTER)
You're right. They're delightful.
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?
(EX CLAIMS)
I'm so over karaoke.
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good.<br/>The best, really.
But it's the greatest samurai<br/>who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.
Oh, baby, they have our song.<br/>Let's do Don't Go Breaking My Heart,
What?
Don't Go Breaking My Heart,<br/>Elton John. Kiki Dee.
No way.
- You gotta go with some Black Sabbath.<br/>- Oh.
Well, actually, Marshall and I have<br/>this little dance routine we do...
Iron Man, I could do Iron Man,
- Steak sauce.<br/>- Steak sauce, dude.
Should we tell him?
All right, Eriksen,<br/>I've got some good news.
On Monday, Bilson and I<br/>are gonna talk to Montague in HR.
When you graduate,<br/>we want you working with us.
What do you say?
- Yes!<br/>- My man!
- I told you he would.<br/>- BILSON: We are gonna have a hoot.
- We're gonna own the office.<br/>- Steak sauce.
Okay, that was gross.
When were you gonna tell me<br/>you changed your entire career path?
Nothing has changed, okay?<br/>I still want to help the environment.
I just thought that maybe<br/>I can make some money for a few years.
We could buy an apartment,<br/>send our kids to good schools.
You could quit your job<br/>and focus on your painting,
I know that you say you don't need it,
but I love you<br/>and I want to give it to you anyway.
I want to give you the package.
The package?
You've already given me the package.<br/>You've got a great package, Marshall.
I love your package.
Lily, you're the most<br/>incredible woman I know
and you deserve a big package.
Your package has always been big enough.
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,
but you've got a huge package.
(MUSIC PLA YING)
Yeah.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Why hasn't she called yet?
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.
It's Saturday night.<br/>Go out and do something.
No, what's the point of going out?<br/>I got a girlfriend. For now.
Besides, if I go out,<br/>who's gonna watch the news?
I'm like half your viewership.
Oh, I'm flattered<br/>you think we have two viewers.
She's not gonna break up with you, Ted.<br/>You're awesome.
Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00.<br/>I should let you go.
Break a leg.
OLDER TED; And so, as I sat at home,<br/>waiting for the phone to ring,
something occurred to me,
I'm actually sitting at home,<br/>waiting for the phone to ring.
(MAN SINGING)
- Marshall.<br/>- Hey.
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you<br/>in a month.
Yeah.
Yeah. How're you doing?
I think Victoria's<br/>about to break up with me.
Oh, God. I'm sorry, man.
Yeah, well,
honestly, I'm having trouble<br/>remembering what she looks like.
The more I try to picture her,<br/>the more I can't.
Like, I remember how she makes me feel,<br/>I just don't completely remember her.
It's like I'm trying to preserve something<br/>that's already gone.
Preserving something that's already gone.
Sounds like environmental law.
I don't know.
I mean, we struggle so hard<br/>to hold on to these things
that we know<br/>are gonna disappear eventually.
And that's really noble.
But even if you save every rainforest<br/>from being turned into a parking lot,
well, then,<br/>where are you gonna park your car?
(MUSIC STOPS)
Rockupied, Dude, what,,,
Next up, Marshmallow and Lilypad,
(MUSIC PLA YING)
(SINGING)
OLDER TED; It turns out<br/>some things are worth preserving,
But here's the real question, It's 2,{{{{{00 a, m,
Your friends are still out singing karaoke,<br/>but you're home early,
because you're expecting a call<br/>from your girlfriend in Germany
who was supposed to call four hours ago,
And then the phone rings,
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.
Um, listen, I know it's late,<br/>but do you want to come over?
OLDER TED; What do you do? Go,
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">TED; Previously on How I Met Your Mother.
TED; She was completely amazing,
She was amazing and funny and,,,
- You have feelings for Ted?<br/>- Maybe.
I've just been offered a fellowship<br/>at a culinary institute in Germany.
- Do you wanna try long distance?<br/>- Yes!
"This long distance thing sucks, huh?
"And I really need to talk to you tonight."
- She's gonna dump me!<br/>- She's not gonna break up with you, Ted.
Hello?
Do you want to come over?
OLDER TED; Kids, your grandma<br/>always used to say to me,
"Nothing good happens after 2,{{{{{00 a, m,"
She was right,<br/>When 2,{{{{{00 a, m, rolls around,
just go home and go to sleep,
Case in point,,,
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Hi, Ted, it's Robin.
Listen, I know it's late,<br/>but do you want to come over?
OLDER TED; Let's back up a little bit,
Sit.
Good boys. Okay.
Remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.
See you tonight.
So, the life of a television reporter<br/>is very rewarding,
and I strongly urge you<br/>to consider it as a career.
Thank you.
- Yeah.<br/>- Do you have a fianc??
Marshall was here yesterday.<br/>They just learned the word "fianc?."
No, I don't have a fianc?.
Then who do you live with?
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.
Don't you get Ionely?
No, I've got five dogs.
My Grandma has five cats<br/>and she gets Ionely.
Well, yeah, that's cats.<br/>I'm not some pathetic cat lady.
Not that your grandmother is...
Does anyone else have a...
- Yes.<br/>- Are you a lesbian?
No, are you? Just because a woman<br/>lives alone doesn't mean she's a...
Okay. Let's have a big hand<br/>for Robin the reporter!
All right, our next guest is another friend...
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks<br/>'cause I just saw one. What up. Tiny five.
Laugh now. Those kids are monsters.<br/>They're gonna eat you alive.
He has a job doing...
- What do you do?<br/>- Please.
Kids, let's rap.
You guys don't give half a brown Crayola<br/>what I do for a living, do you?
- KIDS: No.<br/>- No, no. I know what you want.
- Magic.<br/>- Yeah!
- Hello?<br/>- Why hasn't she called yet?
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.
It's Saturday night.<br/>Go out and do something.
No, what's the point of going out?<br/>I got a girlfriend. For now.
Besides, if I go out,<br/>who's gonna watch the news?
I'm like half your viewership.
I'm flattered<br/>you think we have two viewers.
MAN: And, we're clear.
So, Scherbatsky. Got a boyfriend?
No, and why does this<br/>keep coming up today?
I just thought that guy you<br/>were on the phone with...
What? Oh, no. That was Ted.<br/>He's just a friend.
I mean, there was this moment<br/>where we almost dated,
but we want completely different things.
Anyway, now he has his girlfriend<br/>in Germany
and he thinks she's calling<br/>to dump him tonight,
but I don't think she is.
And, besides,<br/>we want completely different things.
- We should have sex.<br/>- What?
Why not?
We're both available. We're both<br/>attractive. We're both good at it.
At least, I'm good at it.
And even if you're not, don't worry.<br/>I'll have a good time either way.
Well, moving past the horrifying image<br/>of your hair helmet
clanging against the headboard,
I don't get involved<br/>with people I work with.
Get involved? Who said get involved?<br/>I'm just saying we should have sex.
- MAN: We're on in five, four...<br/>- It'd be fun.
Having sex is fun.
Home number. Call me anytime.
A lot of local teams in action tonight.
Hey, guys.
Miss me?
I missed you, too.
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.
Listen, I know it's late,<br/>but do you want to come over?
- Ted?<br/>- Yeah. Hi, I'm here.
- Do you want to come over?<br/>- Why? What's up?
Well, I just finally set up my new juicer,
and I was gonna make some juice.<br/>And I was like,
"You know who likes juice? Ted."
I love juice.
Great, so you want to come over<br/>and make juice?
When it's after 2,{{{{{00 a, m, just go to sleep,
Because the decisions you make after<br/>2,{{{{{00 a, m, are the wrong decisions,
Okay, sure, I'll come over, we'll
- juice.<br/>- Yes, we'll juice.
- Okay.<br/>- Okay, bye.
Bye.
This is fine. This is totally fine.
What's fine?
Oh, I'm going over to this girl's house<br/>to make some juice.
Nice.
No, it's not like that.<br/>We're juicing as friends.
See, I have this girlfriend.
I would never cheat on her.<br/>She lives in Germany.
See, she was supposed to call me<br/>four hours ago to have a serious talk.
I still haven't heard from her. I don't know.
Sorry to bug you with my problems.
Guess cab drivers<br/>are the new bartenders, huh?
You ain't kidding, kid.
Want a nip?
You could just let me out right up here.
- Where are you going to buddy?<br/>- Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.
Okay, here's where I left off<br/>with the last guy.
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over<br/>to this other girl's house...
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.
Hi, Ted. Remember me? Your girlfriend.
Okay, relax. Robin's just a friend.
Right. You're gonna go make some juice.
Yes, yes. Juice is perfectly harmless.
In fact, it's healthy.
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering<br/>what she looks like naked?
I am not...
Okay, even if I am wondering that,<br/>it's only 'cause you put it in my head.
But I am just a manifestation<br/>of your subconscious,
so actually, you put it in your own head.
Damn it!
Nothing's gonna happen.
- Right.<br/>- Okay, okay. You want a second opinion?
Fine.
(DANCE-MUSIC RINGTONE PLAYING)
Hey. Did she call?
No. I need a ruling.
I'm... Yeah, this is stupid.<br/>It's not even a big deal,
but I'm on my way over to Robin's<br/>right now.
She got a new juicer. Whatever.<br/>We're gonna test it out.
Let me call you back.
Honey, there's a situation developing.
Do you remember the huge secret<br/>that you told me
that you weren't supposed to, but you did?
The thing about Robin?
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?
- What?<br/>- What?
Yeah. She told me already. Go on.
Wait. So I'm the only one<br/>that she didn't tell?
She told you and not me?
Well, I guess I'm just better friends<br/>with her than you are.
Well, I'm better friends with Ted<br/>than you are.
- That is a lie.<br/>- It is not a lie.
- Okay, that's it. You and me.<br/>- You think you can take me? Come on!
I'm not afraid of you!<br/>You're embarrassing your...
I'll show you things<br/>you've never seen before!
(BOTH SHOUTING)
Come on. Pick up.
Damn it, Victoria. Where are you?
Pick up! Pick up!
- Cupcake?<br/>- No, thanks.
Where are you? Why haven't you called?
I'm out hooking up.
With three other guys.
Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend<br/>and I'm calling you right now.
Yeah, why do I doubt that?
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Ted. I just saw the news,
and a truck carrying sulfuric acid<br/>overturned right in front of Robin's house.
And it's melting through the sidewalk,
You can see straight down into Hell.
It's bad. You should go home, dude.
Marshall, it's fine.<br/>Nothing's gonna happen.
- Ted, what does your Mom always say?<br/>- Nothing good ever...
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.<br/>Go home! It's too late for juice.
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.<br/>She doesn't even like me that way.
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.
- What?<br/>- It's a big secret.
So don't tell her I told you,<br/>but she's very vulnerable right now.
And you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.
- She likes me?<br/>- Yes,
So you see why it would be<br/>a very bad idea for you to go up there,
Go home, Ted,
She likes me?
Go home, Ted.
You're right, I'll see you at home.
Good. He's going home.
He is so not going home.
I cannot believe you just told him that.
- What do you mean?<br/>- Lily, here's what you just said,
"Ted, whatever you do,
"don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl<br/>who wants to have sex with you."
And then she's gonna<br/>make you some delicious juice!
No. He's not going up there.<br/>He has more sense than that.
OLDER TED; I did<br/>have more sense than that,
- Keep the change. Thanks.<br/>- Thanks.
But after 2,{{{{{00 a, m,,<br/>my good sense was sound asleep,
So, you're doing this?<br/>You're going up there?
You want to get out of the way?
I'm not in the way.
You know, if you had just called me, I...
(EXHALES)
- Hi!<br/>- Hey.
I got some vegetables. I got carrots.<br/>I got beets.
Or we could just drink wine.
Wine not. Wow, that's the stupidest thing<br/>I ever said.
Thanks.
Make it a big glass.
Sure.
So, how's it hanging? "How's it hanging?"
Haven't you ever had one of those days
where nothing at all<br/>that monumental happens,
but, by the end of it, you have no idea<br/>who you are anymore,
or what the hell you're doing<br/>with your life?
Do you ever have one of those days?
About once a week.
I don't know. It was just a rough day,
and the only person I wanted to see<br/>at the end of it was you.
So, how was the big phone call<br/>with your girlfriend?
OLDER TED; When the clock strikes two,<br/>just go to sleep,
We broke up.
What?
Yeah. Yeah. She finally called.
We talked for a while.<br/>How hard long distance is,
and then she dumped me.
Ted, I'm so sorry.
That's just terrible.
I feel awful.
You're smiling.
Am I? No, I'm not.
Well, I'm a news anchor.
Smiling is a part of the job.
Thousands died<br/>in a tragic avalanche today.
See?
You're smiling, too.
Yeah.
I have no idea what that's all about.
(SINGING)
How much does Korean Elvis rock?
I'll answer that. Infinity.
He rocks infinity.
Okay, it's time for bed.
What? No. It's 2:30.
And nothing good ever happens<br/>after 2:00 a.m.
You know, I have found in my travels
that all the best things in life<br/>happen after 2:00 a.m.
When I look back<br/>at the best stories of my life,
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape<br/>I got in at the Russian embassy,
- the almost four-way.<br/>- You never had a four-way.
- I said "almost"!<br/>- Well, all right.
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.
Because after 2:00 a.m. Is when things get,<br/>audience, say it with me, legendary!
- We gotta go.<br/>- What's that? "Interesting theory, Barney,
"but I'll need some proof." Okay.
Korean Elvis. How would you like<br/>to have a drink with me and my friends?
Rock 'n' roll.
And it begins.
So, hey. I got a new phone.
Same as yours. Look.
Oh, yeah, do you like it?
Yeah. Yeah.
This is some solid small talk.
I had that other phone, and it was good,
but I think, the whole time,<br/>a little part of me
wanted this phone instead.
This phone
feels right.
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh, wow. Weird.
Yeah, I should probably take this.
I'll be here.
- Hello?<br/>- Ted. This is your main man K.E.
I want you to shake your tail feather<br/>down here ASAP. You dig?
Okay. Sorry about that.
Who... Was that Korean Elvis?
I'll explain later.<br/>Hey, we're heading down to MacLaren's.
Actually, I'm at Robin's.
Yeah, and I might have done<br/>something bad.
I just lied and told her I broke up<br/>with Victoria.
Ted, I don't want to swear<br/>in front of Korean Elvis,
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?
What do you expect from me? It's Robin!
Victoria's great, but it's Robin!
I've made up my mind,<br/>I'm gonna end it with Victoria.
- Gonna?<br/>- Yes. First thing tomorrow.
Okay, but as of right now,
at 2:45 a.m. You still have a girlfriend.
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.
But if you do this right now,
your entire future with her<br/>will be built on a crime!
Just go home, Ted,<br/>Don't do this the wrong way!
I hate how you're always right.
It's my best and most annoying trait.
Okay.
I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
I should probably get going.<br/>It's pretty late.
- I'm sorry. I...<br/>- Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.
- Can I call you tomorrow?<br/>- Totally.
- Totally. Call me tomorrow.<br/>- Okay.
- Good night, Robin.<br/>- Good night, Ted.
Oh, my God! We're making out.
- Right!<br/>- This is crazy.
Right! Right!
Should we go to my room?<br/>I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...
- Yeah.<br/>- Yeah?
Yeah.
I just, I have to run to the bathroom.<br/>Real quick.
Okay.
(EX CLAIMS)
Stop doing that!
What are you doing?
I'm calling you.
We're breaking up.<br/>I'm doing this right now.
I'm coming out of this bathroom<br/>a single man.
Okay.
Say, Ted, how long do you think<br/>that conversation's gonna be?
Length of an average pee? No.
We're gonna be on the phone<br/>for at least 20 minutes.
Robin's out there. She's gonna think<br/>you're in here taking a massive...
What do you want from me?<br/>People break up. It happens.
Not like this.
Not from the bathroom of the girl<br/>that you're about to sleep with.
It's not ideal.
OLDER TED; Meanwhile, back at the bar,
Barney was still trying to prove that<br/>good things can happen after 2,{{{{{00 a, m,
Come on, Lily!
How many women can say they've been<br/>personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?
Barney, you tried. I think that's great.<br/>But we're going.
- No. No, come on!<br/>- Yes!
Dude. We haven't hit legendary yet.<br/>We're only at the "le."
We still got the "gen," the "da," the "ry."
Okay, if we're at the "le,"
then I say we follow it up<br/>with a "t's go home."
Oh, wow! You just got burned.<br/>Phonics style!
No, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go.
- Just one dance, huh?<br/>- Okay, seriously.
Hey, I know what you like.
OLDER TED; And so, Barney was right,
The night was legendary,
It would come to be known as the time<br/>Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards,
Hey, you guys remember that time<br/>that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards?
You're right.
You're right.
I owe you a real breakup call.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Good. So, you're gonna go home?
Why should I have to go home?
You know, there's every chance<br/>Robin's the woman I'm gonna marry.
- Ted.<br/>- It could happen!
And so, really, what's it gonna matter<br/>in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?
Look, I know this is a moral gray area, but
it's Robin.
And I'm exhausted.
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending<br/>I'm not in love with her.
I think that makes this okay.
Oh, please. You just want to get laid!
Yes, I do. You got me.
That is exactly what I want right now.<br/>And so what?
I want this. She wants this.
It's happening. And if you have a problem<br/>with it, don't be in Germany!
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.
Thanks for not calling me and good night.
That's not your phone.
This isn't my phone.
Okay. Bye.
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.
- Was it...<br/>- It was your girlfriend.
You might want to call her back.
OLDER TED; I called Victoria from the cab,<br/>and we broke up,
Yes, I'm...
And there you have it, kids,
The stupidest thing I've ever done,
In one night, I managed to hurt<br/>two people I cared about,
And none of it would've happened<br/>if I had just listened to my mom,
So, I guess if there's a lesson<br/>to be learned here, it's this,
when it's after 2,{{{{{00 a, m,,
just go to sleep,
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Her favorite cd in the<br/>otis redding box set?
Disc three.
My favorite?<br/>Any guesses?
Anyone?<br/>Come on.
Disc three!
God, victoria's so amazing!
I could talk about her<br/>for hours.
What do you mean "could"?
I'm sorry, it's<br/>just... God, I...
I'm crazy about<br/>this girl.
It feels like maybe...
I don't want to say it.
Trust that impulse, ted.
Hey.
Something kind of cool<br/>just happened.
My story on pickles,<br/>the singing dog,
Just got nominated for<br/>a local area media award.
A... Lame-a?
We prefer<br/>local area media award.
Um...
There's going to be<br/>this big banquet.
I know these things<br/>aren't much fun,
But it would really mean a lot<br/>to me if you guys came.
And there's an open bar.
Oh!<br/>Yes!<br/>Word up!
Yeah, put me down<br/>for two.
Really?<br/>It's three months away.
I know, but...
Guys, I'm sorry,<br/>I'm going to say it.
I have a feeling victoria's<br/>going to be around
For a long time.
I'm going to miss<br/>victoria.
I should just skip this thing<br/>entirely.
Robin's still pissed at me<br/>after... You know.
You lied and said you were<br/>broken up with victoria
Before you actually were<br/>so you could try to nail robin
And you wound up losing<br/>both girls in one night?
Yes, that's what I meant<br/>by "you know."
I haven't seen her<br/>in three weeks.
She won't return my calls.
Look, I shouldn't go.
You should<br/>definitely go.
Look, it's a chance to show<br/>her you're still friends
And that you support her.
Or it's a chance<br/>to mess with her head
By showing up<br/>with someone hotter.
Even better, triple threat--<br/>hotter and bigger boobs.
That's only two.<br/>Count again.
Barney, I'm not bringing a date.
Even if I wanted to,<br/>the thing's in two hours.
So get an escort.
By "escort,"<br/>you mean prostitute?
Why not?
Because... Gross?
Oh, gross.
What, you have some<br/>puritanical hang-up
Dude, it's the world's<br/>oldest profession.
You really think<br/>that's true?
I bet even cro-magnons<br/>used to give cave hookers,
Like, an extra fish<br/>for putting out.
Aha, so then<br/>the oldest profession<br/>would be fishermen.
Kaboom!<br/>You've been lawyered.
Come on, ted, let's get you<br/>a hooker. It'll be fun.
Okay, to bring to the banquet<br/>and hang out with ironically
Or to actually have sex with?
Yes.
No! It's illegal.
And did I mention gross?
That's adorable.<br/>Ted, you're such a hayseed.
Is the growth industry<br/>of the 21st century.
You do realize that<br/>one out of every eight
Adult women in america<br/>is a prostitute.
You just made that up.<br/>Withdrawn.
Lawyered.
The point is,<br/>how long has it been?
57 days.
Is that your water?<br/>May I?
Yeah, go ahead.<br/>Much obliged.
57 days?!
Ted, you are in a slump.
No, it's not a slump.
It's an intentional hiatus<br/>from girls.
A slump is when you strike out
Every time you step up<br/>to the plate.
But I'm off the roster, baby.
I'm in the locker room<br/>sitting in the whirlpool.
And I'll tell you something,<br/>it feels pretty good.
Yeah, you know what else<br/>is in that locker room?
A bunch of naked dudes<br/>hanging brain.
Ted, you need
And I've got the next<br/>best thing-- mary.
She lives in<br/>my building.
She's smart, she's hot,<br/>she's totally cool.
Oh, she sounds great.
And who knows?
Maybe we'll wind up getting<br/>married someday.
You know, if we can get<br/>a blessing from her pimp.
You want to judge<br/>a fellow human being
Based solely on one<br/>external characteristic?
That's racism.
And I do not drink<br/>with racists.
Good day.
You're just waiting for me<br/>to speak, so you can...
I said good day!
So should I wear my hair<br/>up or down?
Lily.
What?
You okay?
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'm just exhausted<br/>from work.
The stupid school board<br/>took away nap time
And now the kids are just going<br/>crazy by the end of the day.
It's much harder<br/>to deal with because,
Well, I don't get my nap.
Wait, you were taking naps<br/>when the kids were?
Is that safe?
Well, they're only five.<br/>What are they gonna do to me?
Ted's still coming<br/>to this thing, right?
Yep.
Do you think, um...
Hypothetically...
It would be weird<br/>if I bring a date?
Look at you, scherbatsky,
Blatantly trying<br/>to make ted jealous.
No, it's just this guy<br/>at the station.
I never get involved with<br/>co-workers,
But he asked me and I said yes.
Is it going to be weird?
No, it's not going<br/>to be weird at all.
Robin's bringing a date.
Oy. That's going<br/>to be really weird.
I know.
Robin's bringing<br/>a date.
Oh.
Okay. That's not weird.
She's bringing a date.<br/>I'm glad she's moving on.
Dude, it's going<br/>to be weird.
Look, in spite of whatever<br/>happened between us,
Robin and I are still friends.
I don't think it'll be weird.
Yeah, it won't be weird.<br/>Thank you.
Because you're going<br/>to bring your own date.
Hello, barney.
Hi, mary.
Have you met ted?
Nice to meet you, ted.
Hi, mary.
Wow.
It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.
So we're going<br/>to an award show?
Uh, yeah, will you just<br/>excuse us for one minute?
Barney.
See you in two shakes, mare.
You two make yourselves<br/>comfortable.
Dude, your narrow-minded views<br/>on professional fornicators
Were harshing my mellow.
So I got you a date<br/>for the evening.
You got me a hooker.
A really hot hook--
A hooker!
Think about it,<br/>this is perfect.
A-- it will make robin<br/>insanely jealous...
B-- you get to have<br/>sex with her...
And c-- maybe by<br/>getting to know mary,
You'll come to see that<br/>courtesans are people, too.
And d-- "b" all night long.
I'm not taking a prostitute<br/>to robin's banquet.
The only people who will know<br/>are you, me and marshall.
No one will suspect a thing.<br/>They'll just see you
With this unbelievably<br/>smoking hot girl and...
Okay, that's a little<br/>bit suspicious.
Look, I'm just trying
To expand your horizons<br/>a little bit tonight.
But if you're not interested,<br/>fine, I'm out 500 bucks.
Whatever.<br/>500 bucks?
Ted, you're my cabron.
With some toothless tranny<br/>from the port authority?
Look at how hot she is.
Robin would be<br/>so jealous.
I'm not trying to make<br/>robin jealous, barney.
Look, I... Tell mary,<br/>thanks, but no thanks.
I have a soul.
And then your uncle marhsall<br/>and I had one of our famous
Telepathic conversations.
Check out robin's date.
I know.
Is that who I think it is?
Yep.
It's sandy rivers.
Sandy rivers was the face of<br/>metro news one,
The most low-budget<br/>cable news channel ever.
Sandy time.<br/>Sandy time!
He was best known<br/>for his morning segment
"in today's paper,"
During which he literally<br/>flipped through today's paper,
Reading them aloud to viewers.
Here we have, on the front page,<br/>a story about a...
I guess, a guy<br/>in a superhero costume
Climbing<br/>the empire state building.
Looks interesting.
These idiotic filler pieces<br/>were a guilty pleasure of ours.
Which sandy<br/>do we want today?
French sandy,<br/>porn star sandy...?
Yosemite sandy,<br/>definitely.
Excellent choice.
I love this guy.
I hate this guy.
Hey.
Hi. I'm lily.<br/>Hi.
Hi. Mary.<br/>It's nice to meet you.
Mary is a friend<br/>of barney's.
Barney invited her.<br/>Just met mary ourselves.
Don't know too much<br/>about mary.
Look, a beer.
Hey.
Hi.
You look nice.<br/>Oh, um,<br/>ted, this is sandy.
Hi. Sandy rivers.
Use my full name.
People get a kick<br/>out of it.
Hi, sandy.
Rivers.
So are you two, uh...
Starting a bunch<br/>of office rumors?
Looks that way.<br/>Looks that way.
Oh, how rude of me.
Uh, robin, sandy... Rivers...
This is mary, my date.
Hi.
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>welcome to the 45th annual
Local area media awards.
Please say hello to our host<br/>for the evening,
King of the Saturday afternoon<br/>kung fu movie,
Vampire lou!
Tonight we celebrate<br/>the very best in broadcasting
And the triumph<br/>of the human spirit.
Man,
Vampire lou just looks great.
I can't believe I'm on a date<br/>with a hooker.
Yeah, I can't believe<br/>you let her and lily
Go to the ladies' room<br/>together, man.
Secrets come out in there.
Oh, please.<br/>How's it's going to come out?
"uh, pass me a towel.<br/>P.S., I have sex for money."
Who has sex for money?
Nobody.
What did you guys<br/>talk about in there?
Anything interesting?
No, not really.
We just chitchatted and<br/>I borrowed her lipstick.
Why is vampire lou the host
Of a Saturday afternoon<br/>kung fu movie?
You know, it just<br/>makes no sense.
God, that pisses me off.
Lily, you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired.
And when I get tired,<br/>I get cranky.
Really?<br/>I couldn't imagine you cranky.
"really? I couldn't<br/>imagine you cranky."
Wow.
Why are you so tired?
Well, I teach kindergarten
And the school board<br/>took away my nap time,
The kids' nap time.
Lily, quit your job.<br/>Work at a private school.
You won't have to deal with<br/>the school board,
And you'll make a ton<br/>more money.
Well, guess what, barney?
I don't base<br/>all my life decisions
On how much money<br/>I'm going to make,
Unlike you and,<br/>sadly, my fiancé.
Well, it's just an<br/>internship, for the record.
Yeah, because if I did<br/>sacrifice all my values
Just for an easy buck,<br/>what would that make me?
A prostitute.
Exactly.<br/>Thank you, mary.
So, mary, what do you do<br/>for a living?
She's a paralegal.
Yes, I'm a paralegal.
So, mary the paralegal.
What does a paralegal<br/>do exactly?
I just assist with<br/>day-to-day clerical work
In a law firm downtown.
Oh, what firm?
Douglas, o'halloran and stamp.
That's a real law firm.
I know.
Nice.
You're pretty good<br/>on your feet.
Are you flirting<br/>with me?
Is that allowed?
Yes, it's encouraged.
You know, I wouldn't normally<br/>say this on a first date,
But... Well, considering...
I'm just going<br/>to say it.
You are so hot!
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
Mary, ted is a great guy.
You hold on to him.
Don't let him out<br/>of your sight for a minute.
So, sandy, what do you do?
Oh, wait, I know<br/>what you do.
You're the guy who reads<br/>the paper in the morning.
You got me.
What do you do, ted?
Oh, same thing as you--<br/>I read the paper every morning.
But then after that,<br/>I finish my coffee
And I go to my real job<br/>as an architect
Where I make an actual<br/>contribution to the world.
I'm just kidding.
Love your show.<br/>You're terrific.
Thanks.
I never tire of hearing that.
Hey, you know that<br/>scene in empire
Where they lower the helmet<br/>onto darth vader's head?
Do you think that's how<br/>sandy puts his hair<br/>on in the morning?
You just insulted<br/>someone I hate
By referencing<br/>something I love.
Damn, you just got<br/>even hotter.
And so, as the night wore on,<br/>I started to realize,
This girl, despite what<br/>she did for a living,
Was kind of great.
Hey.
Hey.
Mary seems nice.
Have you kissed her yet,<br/>or are you waiting
Until you're in a serious<br/>relationship with someone else?
I, uh... I wanted to apologize<br/>for everything that happened.
And just like that,<br/>it's all okay.
Roll credits.
So you're going to be<br/>mad at me forever?
What, we're not even<br/>friends now?
We're still friends.<br/>Are we?
You don't return my calls,<br/>we never hang out
And now you're trying<br/>to make my jealous
By waving edward r. Moron<br/>in my face?
Oh, and paralegally blonde
Isn't here in her low-cut<br/>dress to make me jealous?
Oh, so now she's a whore?
What?
You know something?
Mary the paralegal<br/>is awesome.
And you know what else?
I didn't come here tonight<br/>to make you jealous,
I came here to support you<br/>as a friend.
And frankly, I'm sick of trying.
I like that guy.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
What were you guys talking<br/>about over there?
Oh, I was, uh, just<br/>telling my friend
That I think you're awesome.
Well, thanks.
You know, this is one<br/>of the nicer hotels
I've ever been in.
Oh, yeah, my friend<br/>did the remodel.
You should see the rooms.<br/>The views are amazing.
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad<br/>we don't have a room.
Room 1506.<br/>My treat.
You kids go nuts.
Actually, don't use<br/>the mini-bar.
Do it.
Come on, ted, do it.<br/>This is one of those things
You have to do<br/>before you turn 30.
Sleep with a prostitute?
No, lose your virginity.
What up.
Statistic-- men who have had<br/>at least one relationship
With a prostitute
Are 75% more likely
To have success<br/>in future relationships.
You just made that up.
Withdrawn.<br/>Lawyered.
Okay, three things.
First of all, robin's<br/>category's almost up.
And second of all,<br/>you cannot do this.
It's wrong on every level.
And third,
I've been placing small items
In sandy's hair all night.
He still hasn't noticed.
I know I can't do this.
I'm not doing this.
It's just... It's a shame.
She's really cool.
Yeah, well... There we go.
Scooter "bam-bam" branson<br/>for a bicycle--
Joyride or deathtrap?
For 13, pregnant and addicted.
And robin scherbatsky
For pickles, the singing dog.
And the winner is...
Robin scherbatsky.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is really a surprise.
Um, you know it's nice<br/>to be able to share this award
With my friends.
They're all here tonight.
Marshall, lily,<br/>sandy rivers...
Barney...
And that's it.
Those are all my friends.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
Um, sandy, do you<br/>want to get a cab?
Sure. Let's go.
Yeah, this party's dead.
Mary, you want<br/>to go upstairs?
We, uh, got a room.
Dude, what are you doing?
What's it look like?
It looks bad,<br/>is what it looks like.
You cannot do this.
Marshall,<br/>she is a really cool girl
When you get to know her.
Besides, I'm trying<br/>to make robin jealous.
Oh, that's real mature.
Marshall, what is up<br/>with you and ted?
Nothing, baby.<br/>Don't worry about it.
Fine. Do what you want.
Hey.
Should we go?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Well...
Good night.
Good night.
So, did you<br/>and barney ever...?
There's not enough<br/>money in the world.
Oh, thank god.
Whew.
Wow, so they're...?
Uh-huh.
Robin, where's<br/>sandy rivers?
I put him in a cab.
So you and he aren't...?
I don't date people<br/>I work with.
I was just trying<br/>to make ted jealous.
He's off trying<br/>to make you jealous.
Oh, well, good for them.
And, you know, if ted likes her,<br/>she's probably pretty cool.
Lily, I know you're asleep,
But I have<br/>to tell someone this,
And we tell<br/>each other everything.
So, here it goes.
Mary's not a paralegal.
She's a prostitute.
Mary's a prostitute?
What?!
Barney paid for her.
Is that true?
We were having<br/>a conversation
About prostitution,
And then barney<br/>calls her up
And then she shows up<br/>at the bar
And now she and ted<br/>are upstairs.
Okay, seriously, what is going<br/>on with ted lately?
Is he having<br/>a nervous breakdown?
You know, barney, for anyone<br/>else, this would be a new low,
But sadly, for you,<br/>it's just a new middle.
Oh, my god, I used<br/>her lipstick! Ah!
That's her napkin.
No!
Okay, well, I guess now<br/>is as good a time as any.
In keeping with<br/>tonight's
Award show motif,<br/>I'd like to announce
This evening's big twist ending!
Ah.
Vampire lou, would you<br/>do the honors?
"mary's not<br/>really a prostitute."
That's all, vampire lou.<br/>Nicely done.
Mary's just a paralegal<br/>who lives in my building.
Oh-- ha-ha!<br/>And here's the best part--
She has no idea that ted<br/>thinks she's a hooker.
Oh, come on.
If you don't laugh,<br/>it just seems mean.
I feel kind<br/>of like richard gere.
Not shy about your<br/>looks, are you?
No.
You know, mary, I've never<br/>done this before.
Done what?
You know, been...<br/>On a "date."
Yeah, right.
Wait, you're<br/>kidding, right?
No.
Why, is that so odd?
Well, ted, I mean,<br/>I've been going on dates
Since I was 15.
God, you were<br/>just a kid.
Well, look, let's just<br/>have a few drinks.
We'll relax and...
Yeah, that sounds great.
I had clients riding me<br/>all day long.
Must be tough.
Yeah. I mean, this one guy<br/>just wouldn't leave me alone.
I mean, talk about anal.
Well, here we are.
Uh...
Okay, look, mary,<br/>I like you a lot.
I'm sort of amazed
At how much<br/>I like you,
But I can't do this.
You're a hooker.
What?
Look, maybe I'm<br/>old-fashioned,
But I'm sorry, that's<br/>a deal-breaker for me.
I'm not going to have sex<br/>with a prostitute.
No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.
Come on, mary, there's<br/>no one else around.
You're a hooker.
No, ted...
I'm a paralegal.
No, you're a hooker.
No, I'm a paralegal.
You're a paralegal.
That was not funny.
Not funny, dude.
I know, it was hilarious.
Why would you do that?
I did it to prove a point.
What point?
Stay with me.
It's going<br/>to come to me.
No.
Ah, okay, here's the point.
You thought that mary<br/>was a sure thing, right?
She took you up to a hotel room<br/>on the first date.
All you have to do<br/>is be that confident
With every girl you meet<br/>and your slump is over.
So the message is, I should<br/>treat every woman like a whore?
Come on, dude,<br/>you should be<br/>thanking me.
She slapped me and stormed off.
Can you blame her?
You called her a hooker.
I'm sorry, dude,<br/>it was funny.
Yeah. Well, it's getting late.
I should get back to my room.
Your room?
Yeah, that really<br/>expensive hotel room
You put on<br/>your credit card--
Never checked out.
By the way, you know<br/>what's super fun?
Pouring dom perignon down<br/>a bathtub drain.
Well, it's almost 3:00.<br/>Got a massage. Toodles.
Come on, if you don't laugh,<br/>it just seems mean.

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Kids, about eight months
Into aunt lily and<br/>uncle marshall's engagement,
There occurred<br/>a game-changing emergency.
Van smoot is available.
Oh, my god!
Van smoot house<br/>was a gorgeous mansion
It had everything marshall and<br/>lily wanted for their wedding,
But it was never available.
And then, suddenly, it was.
There was a cancellation<br/>two months from now.
You want to have our wedding<br/>in two months?
No. It's impossible.
It's van smoot, lily.<br/>It's the dream!
No, there's just<br/>not enough time.
There's no way...
Oh! Mini-vomit.
I know that it's sudden,<br/>but check it.
Guess who's on their way<br/>with a deposit check.
Todd and valerie?
There's always one couple<br/>with similar taste
That seems to be<br/>one step ahead of you.
Todd and valerie<br/>were that couple.
We got to make a decision.
Todd and valerie are in motion.
Van smoot!
Oh! Kids, color!
Come on, baby.
Come on, come on, come on.
( All scream )
Hello, marshall.
Lily.
Todd.
Valerie.
Stairs.
I can't believe it.
We got van smoot house.
It is on. It is on!
Like the former soviet<br/>republic of azerbaijan.
What?<br/>You're a wonder.
Wow! You guys are getting<br/>married in two months.
How are you going<br/>to get everything done?
Division of labor.
Everyone's got<br/>a job to do,<br/>so listen up.
Okay, robin, you and ted<br/>go to the florist.
Robin had been mad at me<br/>since the night
I slightly exaggerated my<br/>not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.
Was it...?<br/>It was your girlfriend.
You might want to call her back.
Or, actually,
Robin, why don't you<br/>go to the florist?
And, ted,
I could use your keen
Architectural eye on...<br/>On the invitations.
Wow. That was really<br/>awkward, lil.
And still. It's still<br/>really awkward right now.
Hey, what about me?<br/>What's my job?
What do I get to do?
Okay, your job is very simple.
At the wedding, do not<br/>sleep with anyone
Even remotely related to me.
( Chuckles)
Lil, you know<br/>I can't promise that.
Shh. Shh.
Look how cute she looks.
All tuckered out.
( Whispering ):<br/>Hey, babe.
Hey, little one.
Hey, lily pad.
Crap! Band!<br/>We forgot a band!
It's just gonna be<br/>silence and then people chewing.
Shh! Shh! Baby,<br/>don't worry about it.
I called the 88!
Who?<br/>The 88.
They're this awesome band.
They played my law review party.
They were found guilty.
On three counts of rocking.
I saw them two months ago
At my cousin bonzo's<br/>wedding, they were great.
John "bonzo" bonham<br/>from led zeppelin?
Yes, lily, my cousin,<br/>the drummer from led zeppelin,
Who died in 1980,<br/>got married two months ago.
Look, I... I can't sign off<br/>on a band I've never even seen.
We... We don't even know<br/>if they can play our song.
They're... They're going to have<br/>to come over here and audition.
Baby, the 88 don't audition.
They're, like, the wiggles<br/>of wedding bands.
Well, then... I have to say no.
Baby, they're only<br/>holding the date until Monday.
Well... Well, are they<br/>playing anywhere this weekend?
Let me check their website.
What?
A wee bit intense<br/>about this band thing.
Intense? I have<br/>a wedding to plan
In nine weeks for 200 people.
Even if a dinosaur
Should poke his head<br/>out of my butt
And consume this coffee table,
I need you<br/>to roll with it, okay?
Wow.
Guys!
I just tasted<br/>an amazing caterer.
We already have a caterer.
Oh, right.<br/>You're getting married.
You see what I did there?
It looks like the 88 are playing
At a high school prom<br/>in new jersey tomorrow.
A prom?<br/>Can... Can we go to that?
Call the high school,<br/>they'll let us
Stand in the back and watch.
Yeah. No, they won't.<br/>Why not?
'Cause it turns out<br/>we're not in high school.
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.
We're not sneaking in<br/>to a high school prom.
Yes, we are.<br/>It's the only way.
You're getting on board
With barney's idea?
Man, you really have snapped.
It's nine weeks<br/>till the wedding.
At this point, I'd say yes<br/>to just about anything.
Well...<br/>No, barney.
Ted:<br/>And so aunt lily hatched a plan<br/>to crash a prom.
I'll go with you.
Really?<br/>Yeah.
I never got to go to my prom.
We always had field hockey<br/>nationals in the spring.
( Coughs )
The cough is supposed<br/>to cover the "lesbian."
No, I'm trying to start a thing
Where the cough is separate.
Do you think we<br/>look young enough
To blend in at a high school?
Please, I'm ageless,
Scherbatsky just needs<br/>a good night's sleep,
And you've got "statutory"<br/>written all over your body.
Hey, why don't we all go?
I don't know... more people<br/>might be harder to sneak in.
We don't want<br/>to mess things up for lily.
Yeah, you're right.
Besides, marshall and I have<br/>been planning
On having a guy's night out<br/>before the wedding.
Why don't we just make it<br/>tomorrow night?
Sounds awesome.
We should go out<br/>and just get freakin' weird.
Yeah.
'Cause, you know, you be
A bad, bad man,<br/>and I be an outlaw.
What?<br/>( trilling<br/>high-pitched noises )
Barney:<br/>Wow.
Hey, thelma, louise,
Y'all don't drive off<br/>no cliffs now, ya hear?
Lame!
But seriously,
Leave me a message,<br/>and we'll meet up later.
All right, what do you think?
Horrible.
You're gonna make<br/>such a great dad.
You look so classy and nice.
You're going to stick out<br/>like a sore thumb.
Have you seen how the kids
Are dressing these days,<br/>with the ashlee
And the lindsay and the paris?
They all dress like strippers.
It's go ho or go home.
Well, we have to get in.
I have to see this band,
'cause we have to make<br/>a decision by Monday,
'cause I'm getting<br/>married in 71 days,
And we still<br/>don't have...<br/>Shh.
Sweetie, just focus on<br/>one thing at a time, okay?
Have to dress like<br/>a whore and that's it.
All right.
That's the spirit.
Now, ladies, slut up!
( Chuckles)
I never thought<br/>this would be a bad thing,
But my wardrobe
Just isn't slutty enough.
I didn't know I still had this.
What?
The dress I wore<br/>to my actual prom.
Dude, you are the hottest girl<br/>at this prom, and not like
In a corporate, plastic way.
Like, truly, truly hot.<br/>Like a hot soul.
Aw, you look great,<br/>too, scooter.
So big news.
I heard from umpire school.<br/>I'm in!
Oh, disco!
I am so happy for you.
You mean happy for us,<br/>right, babe?
Scooter, you're gonna<br/>be an umpire someday.
No, baby.
We're gonna be<br/>an umpire someday.
Cheese.<br/>Cheese.
Nice.
You ladies look good,
But your outfits<br/>are missing just one thing.
No, barney, this is as far<br/>as we're going to go.
I'm not showing anymore...
Two beautiful flowers<br/>for two beautiful flowers.
Aw. Sweet.
Thank you.
( Chuckles)
Oh, robin, are you tearing up?
No.
I've never been<br/>to prom before, okay?
We got to go.
See ya.<br/>Ted:<br/>Bye, have fun.
See you.
Oh.
They grow up into skanks<br/>so fast, don't they, ted?
So, what, we ready for tonight?
Yeah. Just one thing<br/>we got to do first.
Shot of jim beam?<br/>Yeah.
Yes!<br/>And then I promised lily
That we'd stuff<br/>200 wedding invitations.
What?!<br/>I'm sorry, dude,
But you saw how<br/>stressed out she is.
Come on! You've been doing<br/>wedding stuff nonstop.
Take a break.
Once you're married,
If we go out and you get<br/>so drunk you throw up,
It'll be sad, but if we do it<br/>tonight... It'll be less sad.
Okay, it'll be cool...<br/>I'll tell you what.
We'll make a game out of it.
First one to stuff a hundred<br/>invitations gets a big prize.
Do I look like I'm four?
All right, what kind of prize<br/>are we talking about?
Wow, a lot more security<br/>than when we were kids.
Is this gonna work?
Yeah. Look, when I was 17,
I used to sneak into clubs<br/>all the time.
It's all about confidence.
Follow me.
Whee-hoo!<br/>Happy prom, everybody.
Going to prom...<br/>whee-hoo!
Uh, you're adults.
Okay, bye.
Okay, look,<br/>I just need to see the band.
I'm getting married<br/>in two months, and...
( chuckling ):<br/>And you're just finding a band?
( Grunts ) hey, ho, hey!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You either need to be a student<br/>or the date of a student.
( Sighs )
Wow. "ma'am"?
Check and mate.<br/>It's cool.
Time to activate plan b.
Scherbatsky, how comfortable<br/>are you with a crossbow?
Scherbatsky?
Hey, guys.
Do you want to take<br/>two hot girls to prom?
We don't have that<br/>kind of money.
For free.
Oh, hell yeah!
Great. I'm robin,<br/>this is my friend, lily.
Hi. Shall we?
Sure.
I knew it would happen.
This is the dream.
Oh, hey, wait.<br/>How's barney getting in?
Don't worry about me.<br/>I'll get in.
Oh... I'll get in.
( Upbeat rock music playing )
We're in!
Thank you. We're going<br/>to take a break.
Oh, you're kidding me.
Hey, uh, you ladies want<br/>something to take the edge off?
Yeah, what the hell?<br/>It's prom.
( Coughs )
That tastes like cough syrup.
Yeah, we couldn't<br/>get any alcohol.
Um, our fake ids<br/>say we're only 20.
We didn't realize it<br/>till after we bought them.
Nerds who aren't good at math?
Life's going to be rough, boys.
Hi.
Excuse me.<br/>I was wondering
If you guys could play<br/>"good feeling"
By the violent femmes.
I know it's probably<br/>not in your repertoire,
But I'm getting married<br/>and my fiancé
Wants to hire<br/>you guys as the band,
But I can't sign off on it<br/>until I hear you play
"good feeling"<br/>because that's our song,
And what kind of wedding<br/>band would you be
If you couldn't play<br/>our song, right? Right?
Look, I'm kinda<br/>wasted right now,
So I didn't understand<br/>any of that.
But, uh, if you get<br/>us the sheet music,
We'll play your song.
So, you buzzing, baby?
My phlegm feels looser.
This is pathetic.
It's guys' night.
We should be out<br/>in a bar getting in fights.
If I got in a fight,<br/>would you have my back?
You know it.
I'd have your back, too.
That's cool.
( Iaughs )
What, you don't think<br/>you'd need my help?
You don't know what I can do.
I'm like...<br/>Like a berserker.
Okay, ted.<br/>( phone rings)
Hello.
Hey, it's robin.
Um, lily needs you to download<br/>the sheet music
For "good feeling" and bring it<br/>out here, like, now.
Hang on.
It's robin.
She wants me to go to prom.
Can ted come?
Wait! Don't ask!<br/>That's so lame!
I don't even want to go anyway.
Uh, I don't know.
Things have been<br/>so weird between us.
What'd she say?<br/>What'd she say?
He lied and told me he broke up<br/>with his girlfriend
To try to hook up with me.
I mean, I know<br/>he apologized for it,
But it's just, it's not easy<br/>to forgive.
Look, if you absolutely must<br/>bring ted, it's, it's not like
I'm going to claw<br/>my own eyes out if he comes.
Okay, bye.
She totally wants you to come.
All right, sheet music's<br/>on the way.
Are you okay?
There's just so much<br/>to do for this wedding.
My head is swirling.
It's just all moving too fast.
How is it moving too fast?
We've been together<br/>for two years.
I just... I just don't want<br/>everything in my life
To be decided already.
I go to umpire school,<br/>you go to college.
We move into my dad's house<br/>in staten island.
We have kids,<br/>we grow old together.
What's decided? It's wide open!
Scooter, when I go off to<br/>college, that's the end for us.
You're, you're breaking up<br/>with me?
There's still so much<br/>I want to do.
I want to travel,<br/>live overseas as an artist,
Maybe have<br/>a lesbian relationship.
Plus, I think<br/>I was just dating you
'cause you look a little bit<br/>like kurt cobain.
I can't believe this.
I can change. I can look<br/>more like kurt cobain.
Please, just don't leave me.
I'm nothing without you, baby.
Please don't put that kind<br/>of pressure on me!
It's too much!
It's just one dance, god!
What?
Well, we did promise<br/>them one dance.
Yeah, sure, okay.
♪ Say what you say,<br/>made up my... ♪
So andrew, what's your big plan?
What's life going to be<br/>like after tonight?
Well, you know<br/>I got it all worked out.
Uh, leave this place in my dust,
Four awesome years at college,
And then I'll move to prague
Or start my own video game<br/>company or something.
No, you won't.
I won't?
No, you won't accomplish<br/>anything you set out to.
You'll get a girlfriend<br/>the first day of college
And you'll give up<br/>your independence
And you'll never live abroad
And you'll wind up old<br/>before your time
Wondering "whatever happened<br/>to my hopes and my dreams?"
Whoa. You really think<br/>I'll get a girlfriend?
So, uh, what's the deal here?
Am I getting lucky tonight?
Oh, sean, look,<br/>um, you're a nice guy,
But I just don't...
( vomits )
No, you're not<br/>getting lucky tonight.
Barney:<br/>Okay, just be cool.<br/>Don't look at me.
Okay.
How'd you get in here?
What's it to you, giant turtle?
It's me, barney.
Oh, hey. Where's lily?
She's in the bathroom.
Wait here, I should<br/>go talk to the band.
All right.<br/>How did you guys<br/>get in here?
We just snuck in the back.
You just snu... Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.<br/>I've been trying<br/>to get in here all night.
I finally paid<br/>a janitor 200 bucks
To let me borrow this<br/>mascot costume.
But you got in.<br/>( sighs )
Slow and steady won the race.
Hey, bro,
Have you seen my fiancée lily?
Your fiancée?
Whoa, tonight<br/>she's with me, bro.
Unless you're looking<br/>for trouble.
Listen, little buddy,
I understand it's prom
And the adrenaline's<br/>pumping, but...
No, not tonight.<br/>I've waited too long for this.
I finally got a girl<br/>and I'm not going
To let you take her<br/>away from me.
Whoa, whoa.
Look, let's not<br/>get carried away.
Yah! Nunchaku!
Oh!<br/>Ted:<br/>I'm coming, marshall.
I can't believe<br/>I unloaded like that
On a high school senior.
I can't believe<br/>a high school senior
Unloaded like that on me.
I'm going to ask you something
And, um, maybe it's crazy
'cause you guys<br/>are the cutest couple ever,
But, um, are you having<br/>second thoughts?
Yeah.
But not about marshall.<br/>About me.
I just keep thinking
About the girl I was<br/>ten years ago
And wondering<br/>what happened to her.
I don't want to be tied down.
I want to live in France<br/>and Spain and Italy
And just soak up life<br/>and put it on a canvas,
Being a waitress in crappy<br/>cafés for five years,
I don't care.
I'm going to be a painter.
And I can't do any of that<br/>with a, with a boyfriend
Shackled around my neck,<br/>you know?
But anyway, I'm blabbering.
Way to make new friends, lily.
I'm sorry. What was<br/>your name again?
Marshall.
Nice to meet you, marshall.
Guess we're hallmates.
Yeah.
( "Good feeling" playing )
It works.
Violent femmes.<br/>I love this song.
Me, too.
♪ Won't you stay with me<br/>just a little... ♪
I didn't have any<br/>of the experiences
I set out to.
The travel, the bohemian art<br/>life, my big lesbian experience.
I didn't do any of it.
Lily, you're marrying<br/>your best friend in the world.
I mean, isn't that worth
All the other<br/>experiences combined?
And look, you can still travel,<br/>I mean, you can still paint.

Yeah.

Well, I don't need it,<br/>but thanks.
Uh, yeah, you did,<br/>and you're welcome.
No, the kid was totally, like,<br/>a white belt and I'm gigantic.

Absolutely not.

So how was your first prom?
You tell me.
I hated my dress,
My date got wasted<br/>and puked on me,
There was a huge fight
And I kissed a girl.
So, basically, it was a prom.
Okay, I've missed you.
Not in a we're-going-<br/>to-make-out way,
Not even in<br/>an I-forgive-you way.
Just in an<br/>I've-missed-you way.
I'll take what I can get.
Barney:<br/>And that, my friends,
Is why you don't<br/>get your money's worth
When you wear jeans<br/>to a strip club.
So you got to admit,<br/>the 88 are rocking our song.
Yeah, it's good.

And then all of a sudden,<br/>you're 28.
And for the birthday boy,
Lasagna.<br/>Thank you.
Careful.<br/>The plate is very hot.
'kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
Ah! Sweet damn,<br/>that's a hot plate.
All right, so, barney,<br/>are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, barney,<br/>don't do this.
I have to, it's my<br/>birthday present to ted.
You don't have to.<br/>Please, it's going<br/>to be embarrassing
And we're going to have<br/>to stop coming here,<br/>which will suck...
In addition to probably<br/>being kind of healthy.
Come on, marshall,
It's the greatest pickup line<br/>of all time.

Oy, gevalt.
Ah...
Happy birthday, ted.
Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has<br/>anyone ever told y...
Oh, my god.

What's going on?
Try not to speak.<br/>Here, sit down.

Nope. I hit<br/>the snooze button.

What is going on?!
I think there might be<br/>some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We got to get her<br/>to the hospital.
What are you<br/>talking about?
You've had<br/>a terrible fall.
No, I haven't.
Really?<br/>'cause I could swear
You fell straight<br/>out of heaven.
Angel... Bing!
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your number.
What?<br/>- Give him your number.
Come on,<br/>you're embarrassing me.
Give him your number.
What are you...?<br/>Come on.<br/>Give him your number.
They're not going to stop<br/>'til you give me your number.
Give him your number.<br/>All right!

I'm picky.<br/>I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone,<br/>she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
It's not like<br/>I have a list.<br/>Oh, yes, you do.
Attractive,<br/>college-educated,
She wants two kids--<br/>a boy and a girl...
That's not hard.<br/>I know at least...
I'm not done.<br/>She likes dogs,
Otis redding,<br/>does the crossword.
She's into sports,<br/>but not so much so
That her legs are, like,<br/>more muscular than mine.<br/>That weirds me out.
And she plays bass guitar<br/>like kim deal from the pixies.
Or kim gordon<br/>from sonic youth.
Any kim from<br/>any cool band, really.
Can't be too picky.
You're never going<br/>to find this girl.
Exactly. So I'm just going<br/>to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan<br/>the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's<br/>just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
And little did I know,<br/>at that very moment,
Fate-- in the form of<br/>a 600 gigahertz
Superprocessing computer--
Was taking care of it.
Whoa, you're up early.
Yeah, thought I'd whip up<br/>some pancakes.
Does marshall know?
He's still sound asleep.
Awesome.
So awesome.
God! Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes,
I should cover you in syrup<br/>and gobble you up.
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Oh, yeah, that totally<br/>got me yesterday.
God, why didn't<br/>you throw it away?
I'm going shopping<br/>after work.
I'll pick up some milk.
Oh...!
These pancakes<br/>are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point<br/>of my day.
It was true.
See, marshall had always<br/>dreamed
Of using his law degree<br/>to protect the environment.
But he needed money<br/>for the wedding,
So he'd been interning for two<br/>months at barney's firm...
And he hated<br/>every minute of it.
Hey, barney,<br/>I had some questions
About filling out<br/>these requisition forms.
Binoculars.
Second pair on my desk.
I don't have time<br/>to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will ya?
Okay, corner office.<br/>Top floor.
Check out that guy.
Name's clark butterfield.
He works over at<br/>nicholson, hewitt and west
And every morning,<br/>he orders a sandwich
From the deli downstairs.
So?
So guess what I did<br/>to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh! Sweet lord.
And now I'm e-mailing<br/>said picture to him.
Ooh! Duck!
That is sick!
Why would you do that?
Who knows?<br/>This feud goes so far back
I can't remember who<br/>fired the first shot.<br/>You?
Totally.
Well, look,<br/>if you would just...
Help me fill out these forms,<br/>that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going<br/>to retaliate
Within the next four hours.
That's been his pattern.
This is war, eriksen.
I need you to clear<br/>your schedule,
Call lily,<br/>tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu...<br/>Come on, man,
I didn't recruit you to work<br/>here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my<br/>executive mischief consultant.
This is a job<br/>for me, barney.
It's a way to make<br/>some extra wedding<br/>money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry,<br/>but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you<br/>come in here, please?
Would you please inform<br/>mr. Eriksen
That I'm no longer<br/>speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, mr. Stinson
Is no longer...<br/>I get it.<br/>Thank you, tracy.
Hello?
Hello. May I speak with<br/>a mr. Ted mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?
Bob rorschach over here<br/>at love solutions.
You signed up for our services<br/>about six months ago.
Uh, yeah.
You guys never found me a match.
Right. Well...
Actually, that's why<br/>I'm calling.
We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.
I don't understand.<br/>What happened to ellen pierce?
Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought<br/>out the company.
You know, we're a high-end<br/>meats and textiles conglomerate,
But the geniuses
At corporate decided<br/>they wanted to diversify, so...
Here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is.
Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.
No way.<br/>The last time I did this,
The girl turned out<br/>to be engaged.
She's not engaged.
She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
So I read the file.
And by god,<br/>this woman was perfect.
She liked dogs, she spent<br/>her summers in north carolina,
She played bass guitar,<br/>she did the times crossword,
She played tennis,<br/>she liked old movies,
Her favorite food was lasagna,<br/>her favorite book was
Her favorite singer<br/>was otis redding
And she wanted two kids--<br/>a boy and a girl.
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me,
So I guess that means<br/>we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte<br/>for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail<br/>from butterfield.
Oh, god!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you<br/>have me drink it?!
Because now...
You're in.
Okay.
Don't think<br/>I'm overlooking
The obvious fact that I<br/>should just be mad at you.
But executive mischief<br/>consultant marshall eriksen
Reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should<br/>brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably<br/>a good idea.
So that night<br/>I had a blind date
With my perfect match.
I was so excited,<br/>I got there early.
But before it even started...
Lily?
Hey, ted, are you busy?
Um... Yes.
Oh, right. Soul mate.<br/>Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab<br/>out to duchess county
And change a flat<br/>on marshall's fiero?
What? No.
Can't you just call marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, ted, it's dark,
I don't know how<br/>to change a tire,
And I've stumbled into<br/>the beginning
Of a very scary campfire story.
Can you please hurry?
I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my god, is that a drifter
With a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
Come on, lily.
But you see my point.
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
And, so,<br/>one $90 cab ride later,
Oh, thank god.
I'm so sorry<br/>about this.
Did you get ahold<br/>of your date?
Yes.<br/>And was she okay
About pushing it back?<br/>Yes.
Because she's perfect.<br/>So what am I doing here?
You can never<br/>tell marshall.
Swear. Swear on the lives<br/>of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on luke and leia.
About a month ago,<br/>I started getting insomnia.
Marrying marshall had been<br/>all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that<br/>it was really happening,
It seemed kind of huge<br/>and scary.
Did you talk to marshall<br/>about it?
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous<br/>about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading,<br/>painting,
Setting the high score<br/>on super bomber man...
That was you? Awesome!
I know!<br/>I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking<br/>about victoria
And how she followed her dream<br/>to germany,
And I found<br/>this art fellowship.
Let me guess.<br/>It's somewhere far away.
San francisco.
But it's not like<br/>I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict<br/>with the wedding.
But I love painting,
And I've always wondered<br/>if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In new haven.
You don't want<br/>to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I... It's not like<br/>I was ever going to do it.
I just... I just really wanted<br/>to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live<br/>in the center
Of art and culture<br/>in america.
I'm sure you could<br/>find a program here
That's just as selective.
But you chose one in a<br/>city 3,000 miles away,
And you didn't<br/>tell marshall.
I think it's pretty<br/>clear what that means.
Okay, I was...<br/>I was having second thoughts.
Oh, man!
But I'm not anymore.
I... I mean,<br/>this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home<br/>and-and be with marshall.
You must think I'm so stupid.
I don't think<br/>you're stupid.
I love marshall.
I know you do.<br/>Come here.
It's okay. Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed<br/>to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come marshall<br/>isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one<br/>large shipping box<br/>and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to new haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know<br/>if I can get in.
If I do this interview,<br/>and get into the program,
Then I'll know, and I can forget<br/>all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not<br/>an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are<br/>certain things in life
Where you know it's a mistake
But you don't really<br/>know it's a mistake
Because the only way<br/>to really know it's a mistake
Is to make the mistake,<br/>and look back, and say, "yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake
Would be<br/>to not make the mistake,
Because then<br/>you go your whole life
Not really knowing if something<br/>is a mistake or not.
And, damn it,<br/>I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this--<br/>my life, my relationship,
My career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this<br/>make sense to you?
I don't know. You<br/>said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married<br/>in two months,
And I'm freaking out,<br/>and you're my best friend,
And you just have<br/>to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily. Lily!
Hey, lily, this is ted,
The guy you left stranded<br/>by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say<br/>good luck with the interview,
Remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you<br/>the same thing.
Hey, I need a big favor.
Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to<br/>duchess county and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing<br/>in duchess county?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy,<br/>but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that ted?
Yeah. He's stuck<br/>in duchess county.
Don't you have<br/>a big date tonight?
Uh... Marshall. Hi.<br/>Yes. Yes, I do.
So what are you doing<br/>in duchess county?
Can't a brother go apple picking
Without getting<br/>the third degree? Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.<br/>I'm coming to get you.
Relax, man.<br/>I'll take the fiero.
No, no, no. Just...<br/>Forget it.
Ha, ha! A little prank.
I'm not in duchess county.
So that's the prank?
That you're not<br/>in duchess county?
Yep. Gotcha! Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out<br/>this one.
It actually looks<br/>like butterfield.
You know, over at the nrdc,
It's a bunch<br/>of really committed people
Who take their job<br/>of saving the earth
Very, very seriously.
Which is great,<br/>and everything,
But I can't imagine having<br/>this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming<br/>to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, tracy.
Are you guys planning on<br/>punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
Were you going<br/>to think of that?<br/>No.
That would have been bad.<br/>Horrible. Ooh!
Luckily, there was still<br/>one person I could call
To get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry. I don't get in vans<br/>with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.<br/>I got candy.
Candy?!
So you're not going to tell<br/>me what you were doing
By the side of a highway<br/>in duchess county?
Nope.<br/>Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
I like your hat.
Right. This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room<br/>of your dental practice?
Highlights<br/>is a children's magazine.
Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took<br/>"highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger,"<br/>hence the hat.
Oh. I gotta see this.
No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says,<br/>changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate<br/>on the mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm. Uh...
College educated-- check.
Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is love<br/>in the time of cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "love in the time<br/>of don't bothera."
You know, it's very rude<br/>to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.<br/>We're in a van.
Vans have doors--<br/>let me see your hair.
Never. What else?
She loves lasagna.
Barf.
You know,<br/>I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look<br/>like a tiger-- check.
Ah!
And she's looking to get<br/>married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids--<br/>a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know,<br/>I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have<br/>zero kids.
Really? You don't want kids?
You know, ted, not everyone<br/>is as much of a woman as you.
Hey. I'm driving.
Look at that.
8:56. You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything<br/>you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had<br/>a rough night.
I want you to<br/>go in there
With a smile on your face, so,<br/>uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me<br/>your hair?
Actually, I was going<br/>to show you my breasts,
But... Sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.

Tomorrow morning, barney's going<br/>to send out the package,
And butterfield's going to be<br/>knee-deep in angry white mice.
Oh, hey, dude.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, lil, did you, uh,<br/>get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to...<br/>Drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know<br/>milk is important--
It's got vitamin a,<br/>vitamin d,
It's a great way to<br/>start the morning--
But ted just<br/>had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What? Why?
I changed my mind.<br/>I don't want to meet her.
Why? She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want robin.
Oh, god, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake<br/>I have to make.
Wrong. It's a mistake<br/>you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and robin have tried<br/>this again and again...
Here's the thing<br/>about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know<br/>something's a mistake,
You gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn<br/>that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Even really,<br/>really dumb mistakes.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">It was may of 2006<br/>in new york city
But everything<br/>was about to change.
So... What do you think?
Robin again?
Ted,
The universe clearly<br/>does not want
You and robin<br/>to be together.
Don't piss<br/>off the universe.
The universe<br/>will slap you.
Don't you think the universe<br/>has more important things
To think about<br/>than my dating life?
Unless your dating life<br/>is the glue holding
The entire<br/>universe together...
Whoa. Chills.
Anybody else<br/>get chills?
Look, I realize we've<br/>been down this road before,
Whatever I do, it all keeps<br/>coming back to robin,
So... I gotta do this.
Ow! What the hell?
That wasn't me.
That was the universe.
The funny thing was,<br/>at that very moment,
The universe was<br/>working on something-- a storm.
So tropical storm willy<br/>is going to be with us
At least until Monday.
It's gonna rain<br/>cats and dogs, folks.
So don't step in a poodle.
Sandy? Robin?
Thanks, lou.
Boy, too bad.
Our big metro news one
Camping trip was going<br/>to be this weekend.
Yeah, but camping out in the<br/>rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.
Guess we'll have<br/>to take a rain check.
And we'll check in with<br/>you tomorrow, new york.
Have a great night.
And, we're clear.
Bummer.
I was hoping to<br/>finally have sex
With you this<br/>weekend, scherbatsky.
Well, I'd give you<br/>the "I don't date
Coworkers" speech again,
But, god, you must have that<br/>sum'bitch memorized by now.
Shame, though.
It was a pretty<br/>hot show tonight.
The rhythmic give and take
Of our improvised banter<br/>there at the end
Really got my<br/>freak juice flowing.
How many times do you have<br/>to watch this crash and burn
Before you say, "enough"?
One more. One more time.
One more big, beautiful,<br/>stupid romantic gesture.
And then,<br/>whatever she says,
Yes or no,<br/>that's it.
If it's yes, great.
If it's no, then I am done<br/>going after robin forever.
So what's this
Big, beautiful<br/>romantic gesture?
I am going to make her...
A mix cd.
No, I'm kidding.<br/>I got a plan.
Lily, I'm going to need the<br/>spare key to robin's apartment.
I see where<br/>this is going.
Ted, waiting naked in<br/>a girl's bed wearing<br/>whipped cream undies
Does not work... Usually.
The setting--
Martha's vineyard, 1999.
The characters: Yours<br/>truly and a raven-haired
Au pair by the name...
Universe.
So, this plan<br/>you speak of?
Remember the first night<br/>robin and I went out?
I stole a blue french horn<br/>for her and it almost worked.
Yeah. Dude,<br/>that was awesome,
But how are you ever<br/>going to top that?
She should be here any second.
Uh, we're pretty hungry.
When do we get our pizza?
Enough with the-- we'll go get<br/>pizza later, all right?
Just...
Damn it.
Hello.
Hey, lily, I'm locked out<br/>of my apartment.
I need to come<br/>pick up my extra key.
Extra key?
Do I have an extra key<br/>to your apartment?
Yes, I gave it to you.
Oh, right. That key.
Yeah, I lost it.
Great, now I gotta go<br/>to the locksmith.
No, wait, uh...
Maybe you should just knock.
Knock?
Lily, my dogs<br/>aren't that well trained.
Hello, lily, this is janet kagan
At the russell house<br/>art foundation
I'm pleased to inform you<br/>that we've accepted
Your application<br/>for our summer fellowship.
We look forward<br/>to hearing from you. Bye-bye.
Uh, robin,
I-I gotta go.<br/>Just knock, okay?
Summer fellowship?
Just knock.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Robin...
I've sort of said this already.
I've tried to say it,<br/>and I've said it badly.
So this is me, just saying it.
With strings.
I'm crazy about you.
I think we should be together.
What do you say?
What do you say?
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
Those are the three options.
Ted, this is so...
I know.
I come home, I was<br/>going to watch jeopardy
And there's a<br/>string quartet and...
I have to pee.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Un, well, go ahead.
We'll, uh, we'll wait.
Yeah, 'cause when<br/>we talked earlier,
You said there'd be pizza.
No, I said I'd get you<br/>a pizza afterwards.
Look, could we talk<br/>about this later?
I'm sort of professing<br/>my love here.
Sure.
We're not getting<br/>any pizza.
Okay.
Let's talk.
Okay.
Um...
Oh, hey, you guys<br/>want to take five?
Thanks, guys.<br/>Just need a minute.
Sort of a big<br/>life decision.
Love the blue<br/>instruments, though.
Kind of an inside joke.
Thanks.
You're crazy.
Right.
It's not that I haven't<br/>thought about this.
You know that I have,<br/>but let's look at this, okay?
We only just started<br/>being friends again.
I know. But-- come on.
And we want different things.
That's still there.
That's not going away.
I mean,<br/>what if we do this
And it doesn't work out<br/>and I'd lose you as a friend?
I gotta<br/>think about this.
Okay, fine.
Think about it<br/>on the plane.
Let's go to paris<br/>for the weekend.
I'm serious.
I'm kidding.<br/>I'm serious.
I can't go to paris,<br/>I'm going camping.
I thought that<br/>thing was canceled.
Well, it's back on.
Since when?
Since like an hour ago.
...Sending the storm<br/>back out into the atlantic.
So it's blue skies this weekend.
Sandy? Robin?
Thanks, lou, but<br/>that blue sky
Isn't without at<br/>least one cloud.
I'm sorry to announce<br/>that one week from today
I will be leaving<br/>metro news one.
It has been an honor to bring<br/>you the news each night,
And read the paper<br/>to you each morning.
I will always<br/>treasure it.
Good night, new york.
And we're clear.
You're leaving?
There. I quit my job.
We're not coworkers.
Will you please<br/>have dinner with me?
I'm joking.<br/>I got offered a job at cnn.
Oh, congratulations.
Congratulations yourself.
What do you mean?<br/>Well,
Joel asked me<br/>who I thought
Should replace me<br/>as lead anchor.
I told him you.
They're announcing it<br/>next week. Act surprised.
Wow.
Thanks.
And, yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, let's go get dinner.
How about this weekend<br/>on the camping trip?
I roast a mean weenie.
Oh, you're kidding me.
No way.
Don't go on this thing.
Ted, I have to go.
It's a company camping trip.
Really? Because it also<br/>kinda sounds like a date.
With sandy... And his weenie.
I mean is this<br/>not a date?
I don't-I don't know.
So, what?
You actually like this guy now?
I don't know.
Are you gonna hook up with him?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
No, ted, I don't.
And you know what? That's okay.
I don't plan out every second<br/>of my life like you do.
I don't plan out every...
Oh, really? What is all of this?
I mean,<br/>why can't you just say,
"hey, robin,<br/>let's go get some sushi?"
No, it has to be<br/>a-a string quartet and-and paris
And flowers and chocolates
And let's spend the rest<br/>of our lives together.
Don't you think we're a little<br/>bit past sushi at this point?
God, you are
So terrified of anything real.
It's like you're<br/>floating out in space.
Touch the<br/>ground, robin.
Live in the world,<br/>make a mistake.
Make this mistake.
I need to think about this.
Fine.
No, I'm sorry, I...
I can't do this anymore.
I need an answer.
If you want me to say yes<br/>right now, I-I can't do that.
Well, if it's not yes,<br/>then it's a no.
Then I guess<br/>it's not meant to be.
Nice try, buddy.
Good hustle out there.
Look at the bright side.
At least you got<br/>some closure.
She's made her choice and<br/>you can finally move on.
Screw that. This ain't over.
Ted, you sat here
In this very booth<br/>and you said...
I don't care<br/>what I said.
This is gonna happen.
She can't say it's<br/>not meant to be.
It is meant to be,<br/>and you know why?
'cause I mean it to be.
Unpause?
Unpause.
See, marshall and lily<br/>had a rule
That at any point<br/>during a fight
They could pause<br/>and take a break.
Their fights often lasted<br/>for days.
A painting fellowship?<br/>I was never going to take it.
In california?<br/>I was never going<br/>to take it.
Ted, she is going<br/>on that camping trip.
Dude, barring<br/>some act of god,
Robin's gonna be with<br/>sandy this weekend.
Fine.
If an act of god<br/>is what it takes,
Then an act of god it is.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna make it rain.
I can't let robin<br/>go camping with this guy.
So how do I keep that<br/>from happening?
Simple-- I make it rain!
Ted, do you want me<br/>to slap you again?
'cause I kind of enjoyed<br/>it the first time.
Look, I-I might be<br/>crazy right now...<br/>No, you know what?
I am definitely<br/>crazy right now,<br/>but I have a plan.
That girl you used<br/>to go out with, penelope,
Wasn't she getting her phd<br/>in native american culture?
Yeah.<br/>Are you still<br/>in touch with her?
Sure. I mean, even though<br/>we stopped having sex,
We still get together,<br/>like, once a month to<br/>chat and catch up,
And of course I'm not<br/>in touch with her!
Well, you're gonna need<br/>to get in touch with her.
She's gonna teach me<br/>how to do a rain dance.
Did you just say<br/>a "rain dance"?<br/>Yes.
A rain dance.<br/>Yes.
A dance to make it rain.
Yes.
We're finding penelope!<br/>No, we are not!
Yes, we are!<br/>Ted, you're forcing me
To be the voice of<br/>reason, and it's not<br/>a good look for me!
Why the hell<br/>should I help you?
Come on, I know<br/>it didn't work out between us,
But we did...<br/>Have a relationship.
We had sex twice<br/>in your car,
And then you dumped me.
How is that<br/>a relationship?
Twice!
Barney, there is
No way...
Seriously, come on.
Penelope, I really need<br/>to make it rain this weekend.
Why?<br/>There's this girl...
"There's this girl."
You know,<br/>the traditional rain dance
Is a sacred prayer<br/>to nature.
I don't think
The great spirit<br/>looks too kindly
On white dudes<br/>who co-opt it to get laid.
Penelope,<br/>this is the girl I love.
If it doesn't rain this weekend,
She's gonna end up<br/>with the wrong guy. Please.
This wrong guy,<br/>is he a huge jackass?
Absolutely.
Kind of like barney?<br/>Kind of.
Hey.<br/>You hit on my mom!
We weren't exclusive!
I'm in.
And so the three of us
Headed up to the roof<br/>of my building.<br/>Okay.
Crouch down<br/>and bend over a little bit.
Wow, it took five shots
Of tequila to get you<br/>in that position.
I will throw you<br/>off this roof.
There's so much<br/>of your mom in you.
And she's been throwing up<br/>ever since.
So how'd she manage to<br/>eat so much chocolate?
Remember that guy, ted,<br/>that I was telling you about?
Well, I came home<br/>and I found him
Waiting in my apartment<br/>with a string quartet
And roses and chocolates...
Oh, that's so sweet.
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory,
But isn't it also<br/>kind of crazy?
I mean,<br/>a string quartet
In my living room--<br/>who does that?
Nobody does that.
No, honey--<br/>nobody does that.
But I guess I'm just<br/>a hopeless romantic.
I'm gonna put my hand<br/>up your dog now.
So you're saying<br/>you would forbid me from going?
Forbid? Who said forbid?
I was just reminding you<br/>that there's this wedding
Coming up<br/>in a couple of months,
And I was kind of hoping<br/>you'd save the day.
Look for me-- I'll be the guy<br/>in the awesome suit.
I mean,<br/>come on, lily.
It's what you've<br/>always wanted.
Yeah, but there's a lot of<br/>things I've always wanted,
And I haven't done<br/>any of them.
I'm sorry.
I just need to do this<br/>before settling down forever.
So now we've gone from<br/>"I was never gonna do it"<br/>to "I need to do this"?
Did I leave the room<br/>at some point?<br/>When did that happen?
Oh, maybe when you said<br/>you wouldn't let me do it.
I never said that!
You know, if you're having<br/>these kind of doubts now,
Maybe we just shouldn't<br/>get married at all.
Maybe not.
Pause.<br/>Pause.
So, are you just,<br/>like, starving?
Totally. Red lobster?
♪ oh, lobster,<br/>lobster, lobster ♪
♪ you are delicious!<br/>Oh, god,
I love butter sauce!
There's nothing bad about it.
Say something bad<br/>about butter sauce, I dare you.
Marshall, no.
We're on pause.
There's no crying
In pauseland!
Pauseland is a magical place,<br/>with-with...
Popcorn shrimp mountains
And butter sauce rivers!
Damn it.
♪ happy, happy, happy,<br/>happy, happy ♪
♪ happy birthday,<br/>happy, happy, happy, happy ♪
♪ happy, happy birthday,<br/>happy, happy... ♪
Ted, this is funny.
Still funny.
Still fu...
And now it's sad.
Hey, penelope, you sure<br/>I'm doing this right?
I think so.<br/>Uh-huh.
Does it, uh, look anything<br/>like a real rain dance?
I think so.
Hey, penelope,<br/>have you, uh,
Have you ever actually seen<br/>a rain dance performed?
No.
Extensively on the subject:<br/>Firsthand accounts,
Theoretical criticism,<br/>the anthropological...
Have you ever seen<br/>a rain dance?
I've seen a film strip.
Terrific. Uh,<br/>look, I should run.
I'm getting brain surgery<br/>from some guy who's seen
A couple episodes of e.R.
I can't believe this.
We've been up here<br/>for the past hour making<br/>complete asses of ourselves.
What do you mean "we,"<br/>white man?
How did we get here?
Couple of days ago, the<br/>biggest problem in my life
Was, did ted eat the<br/>last pudding snack<br/>pack in the fridge.
I think there's<br/>still one left.
Dibs.
Unpause?
Unpause.
Look...
I know this sucks.
It's just something<br/>I'm going through.
I'm not asking you<br/>to understand it.
I'm not asking you<br/>to be happy about it.
I... I'm just asking you<br/>to support it.
I want to, lily, okay?
I really do.
But I just can't.
Why not?<br/>Because you're scaring the hell<br/>out of me, that's why not.
What if you decide<br/>to go be a painter
And then you realize I don't<br/>fit in to your life anymore,
And three months<br/>becomes forever?
Can you promise<br/>me that
That's not gonna happen?
Marshall...<br/>'cause if you can't
Promise me that, we should just<br/>break up right now.
I'm not gonna wait around<br/>for three months
Just to have my heart<br/>ripped out.
Marshall, I love you.
Can you promise me<br/>that that's not gonna happen?
Pause.
No, lily, we cannot<br/>pause this anymore.
Can you promise me that<br/>that's not gonna happen?!
Pause!<br/>Why do you want me to pause?!
That's just a great use of<br/>the pause function, baby.<br/>Thank you.
Hey, ted.
Whatcha doing?
A rain dance.
Dude,
That's a fat kid<br/>with a bee in his pants.
Look, I highly doubt
The great spirit is a stickler<br/>for choreography.
It's the thought that counts.
She's leaving in half an hour.
These are your awesome years.
You're wasting them<br/>on this girl.
This isn't gonna work!
Yeah. I know that.
Well, then why are<br/>you doing this?
Because I love her.
I told her that<br/>the first night we went out,
And here it is, eight months<br/>later, and nothing's changed.
So, yes, I know<br/>this isn't gonna work.
But it has to work!
You hear me, universe?
This is ted mosby talking!
Give me some rain!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on...!
Oh, come on!
Pushing the front back<br/>into the tristate area
And giving manhattan<br/>one of its worst storms
In over a decade.
How about that?
He did it.
Robin!
Hey, robin!
Oh,
Thank god you're here!
My camping trip got rained out.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, it is.
Come down here.
It's pouring.<br/>You come up.
No, you have to come down here.
Why?
Why? Because I made it rain,<br/>that's what I did today!
And that's enough.
I-I've done my part.
Now, get down here!
I'm not dressed, ted.<br/>No. Come up.
I'm not coming up there, robin,<br/>I'm not.
You have to come down here!
I was gonna...
I know.
And that's how robin<br/>and I ended up together.
Turns out, all I had to do<br/>was make it rain.
As I rode home<br/>the next morning,
The city looked the same,<br/>the people looked the same,
It all looked the same,<br/>but it wasn't.
In just one night,
Everything had changed.

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006,
And life had just taken<br/>an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
To the part where you meet mom?
I feel like you've been talking<br/>for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff<br/>I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
Could I go to the bathroom?
No.
The summer of 2006<br/>was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great.
In fact, day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together<br/>with robin.
But while I'd been off having<br/>one of the best nights
Had been having one<br/>of the worst nights of his.
♪ Crying in the street...
Marshall:<br/>So that's it?
We're breaking up?
Marshall, I'm sorry.<br/>I just...
To san francisco<br/>and do this art program
And-and figure out<br/>who I am outside of us.
And the only way
That I can do that is if...<br/>If we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never, okay?
You walk out that door,<br/>and we're done.
You're never going to hear<br/>my voice again.
I should call her.<br/>No, no.
Ted, it is...<br/>If you call her
When she asked you not to<br/>you're just going to look weak
Now, listen, whenever<br/>you feel like calling her,
You come find me first.
And I will punch<br/>you in the face.
You're a good friend, ted.
(knock at door)
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how lily and marshall<br/>broke up,
And lily's gone and nothing else
Even remotely important happened<br/>last night,
Yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my god.
I-I'm so sorry.<br/>Wh...
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know<br/>if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message<br/>until I woke up.
Bro, I am so sorry.
Thanks.
I know it must be tough,
But are you ready<br/>to hear something
That will not only<br/>make you feel better,
But will actively excite you?
For the first time, ever,<br/>the three of us are single
At the same time.
I've dreamed<br/>about this day, boys,
And it's going to be
Legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back<br/>at her ex-boyfriends,
We'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve<br/>her father issues
Through promiscuity and binge<br/>drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party<br/>drives through the city
In a limo, sticking their<br/>heads out the sunroof shouting,
(mimicking female voice):<br/>"what's up, new york?"
We will be what is up new york.
Gentlemen, we are<br/>about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys<br/>did it, didn't you?
Captioning sponsored by<br/> 20th century fox television
Is that when love<br/>is beginning...
(moans)
And love is ending,
The first 30 days<br/>are remarkably similar.
For one thing, you spend<br/>most of your time in bed.
(moans)
(groans)
Your friends can't stand<br/>to listen to you.
He's so ticklish.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... Stupid, man.<br/>(mimicking choking)
And you never seem<br/>to wear pants.
(sighs)
Hey, marshall.
Hey, ted.
You hungry?<br/>What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario,<br/>you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking<br/>about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat<br/>something; what can I get you?
Beer.
No, that's what you had<br/>for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
Barney:<br/>So, he stays home
All the time not getting laid?
No, see,
That's what you do when you have<br/>a fiancée.
He should be down here<br/>celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor<br/>removed.
You should write and illustrate<br/>children's books.
You know what marshall<br/>needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad<br/>and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go<br/>at his own pace.
Anyway, lily's the one<br/>who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her some slack.
She's just trying to<br/>figure out who she is.
Yeah, she should call me;<br/>I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes are so blue.
Aw, teddy bear.
(mimics sword unsheathing)<br/>oh, that's a...
(groans)
(coughs)
Yeah, it was hard to feel<br/>too bad.
I was dating the woman<br/>of my dreams,
And things were going great.
Well, for the most part.
So, I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells<br/>and hope.
Somehow,
Erotic and comforting<br/>all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought<br/>he'd never go to sleep.
(moans)
Uh-oh.
Already?
He's calling her.
I don't hear any...<br/>He's calling her.
No.<br/>(screams)
Marshall: Okay, you're<br/>right, I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this,
She changed her number.
What, like I'm going<br/>to stalk her,
Or something?<br/>Like she's so special.
Like she's the only lily aldrin<br/>out there.
'Cause there are four others<br/>in the san francisco area alone,
And they all seem<br/>a lot better than her
Based on the brief conversations<br/>I had with them.
Does he know I'm in here?
Yeah, hey, robin.
Anyways, one of the<br/>lily aldrins said...
This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want<br/>to move too fast,
And yet somehow, we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
He cries a lot,<br/>he keeps us up all night.
Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were<br/>together nine years.
It's only been a<br/>month and a half.
He just needs to<br/>go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor<br/>last night, ted.
He watched a scary movie.
It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him<br/>out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
Announcer (over speaker): Gentlemen,<br/>please welcome to the stage, sunshine.
All right, I really don't think<br/>this is going to help.
Do you know why you're<br/>not over lily yet?
It's 'cause you can<br/>still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman<br/>until you can no longer
Picture her boobs;<br/>it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can<br/>only store a finite number
Of boob images<br/>or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled<br/>to capacity with lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away<br/>until you overwrite them
With images of<br/>other women's boobs.
Now, this journey may take
As many as a million boobs,
So we begin here<br/>tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's<br/>a beautiful day.
The indians are winning.
I got to admit,
It is really nice to be outside.
Announcer (over speaker):<br/>Yankee fans,
Please turn your attention<br/>to the diamond vision
For a special<br/>seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
Oh, no.
(crowd sighing)
(applause and cheering)
It's all a big lie!
She's just going<br/>to break your heart.
(crowd booing)
You can drag me out of here,<br/>but she has no soul!
We've tried everything...<br/>Baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat<br/>a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem<br/>with guys.
You don't know how to deal<br/>with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your<br/>prescription, dr. Estrogen?
Eat haagen-dazs<br/>and watch love actually,
Till your periods sync up.
(ted, barney laughing)
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh, my god.
How long have you<br/>been doing this?
Well, my dad taught me<br/>to shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely<br/>or depressed, I come here,
And it reminds me that...
Guns are fun.
(chuckles lightly)
Um, you know, ted is<br/>kind of against guns.
And that's why
Ted's never going<br/>to find out about this.
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
With me holding a gun,<br/>didn't it?
No, I-I just mean,
Please don't tell ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, this<br/>is what I needed.
I felt so powerless<br/>this whole time,
But this... (laughs)
This is power.
This is...<br/>(gasps)
I should have mentioned<br/>the recoil.
I got to hand it to you,<br/>when he got home,
Marshall was smiling.
Did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually,
Like, three days away<br/>from suggesting that.
Sometimes, all you need<br/>is to get in touch
With your feminine side.
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah!
Well, congratulations.
You're the first person<br/>to cheer him up all summer.
You win.<br/>Oh, what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away<br/>this weekend.
You are?<br/>Mmm.
That's so nice.
Yeah, my aunt and uncle<br/>have a beach house
Out in montauk, oh,<br/>it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like<br/>three affairs there.
Wow, must be a nice house.
I've seen pictures<br/>of your uncle.
This is going to be so great.
We'll finally get<br/>some time alone.
Are you sure marshall's<br/>going to be okay with this?
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.<br/>Oh.
In fact, take my car.
Really?<br/>Yeah.
Hey, thanks...<br/>And, hey,
If you need anything day<br/>or night, just call me...
You know what,<br/>please don't call me.
What? What's wrong?
It's, uh,<br/>lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten
To switch her address.
So?
So, I wonder what kind<br/>of charges she's making
Out there in san francisco.<br/>No.
No, no good can come<br/>from looking at this.
You've made too much<br/>progress already.
I know but I just,<br/>maybe the... no!
You're going to<br/>thank me for this.
You're a good friend, ted.
August 5th,<br/>one charge... tickets.
To what? George clinton<br/>and the p-funk all-stars.
August 10th, one charge:<br/>Tennis emporium.
August 18th, two charges:
Mario's bistro<br/>and, get this, pet palace.
You guys see what<br/>this means, right?
Wow, mario's bistro.
What a perfect place<br/>to whore around.
Only the best<br/>for my little lily pad.
Oh, funk legend george clinton,
I am so glad you spotted<br/>me at your concert
And dragged me onstage to dance<br/>with you courtney cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed<br/>to play tennis with me.
Aw.
You know, marshall<br/>tried to get me
To play tennis for nine years,
But I didn't do it, because<br/>I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
Oh.
A ferret.
Oh, I'll buy it some food<br/>next door at the pet palace.
Oh, I've always wanted one,
But marshall had this<br/>secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made<br/>you promise not to tell nobody.
(laughing):<br/>It was.
Oh.
I love you, funk<br/>legend george clinton.
I love you, too, lily.
That's right, marshall,<br/>she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play<br/>with my hair.
♪ Ow, we want the funk
♪ give up the funk...
That's the craziest<br/>thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, why are you<br/>afraid of ferrets?
Because, robin, they're like<br/>fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
Plus, those charges are<br/>from, like, a month ago.
Exactly.<br/>For new charges,
You can see credit card activity<br/>from, like, two hours ago.
But, you know, don't.
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!
Barney:<br/>He needs her password.
It's not like he<br/>has her password.
Ooh, this is good,<br/>he has her password.
There's a charge<br/>from earlier today:
The kellett hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in new york.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in new york?
I-I guess I've been thinking
When she got back,<br/>she'd call me.
That's really the only reason
I've been able to hold it<br/>together so far this summer.
This has been<br/>"holding it together"?
Okay, you know what?<br/>I'm calling her.
No.<br/>Ted, give me the phone.
You're not calling her,<br/>this changes nothing.
You, come here.
Look, while we're away<br/>this weekend,
Can you keep an eye on him,
Make sure he doesn't<br/>call that hotel?
You want me to baby-sit him?
(laughs):<br/>20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh, yeah, how about<br/>you do it for free
Or every time we hang out,<br/>you have to watch this?
My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.<br/>Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
Marshall.<br/>Marshall, marshall!
Ted, I know I shouldn't<br/>do this, but I have to!
You call her everything<br/>we've worked so hard...
(both yelling at once)
Hello, lily aldrin's<br/>room, please.
Thank you.<br/>Hang up now.
Ted, I can't hang up now.<br/>Hang up now.
The missiles are in the air, and<br/>I know that you don't approve.
Hang up.<br/>Hello.
Uh, a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy<br/>in her room.
I'm going down there.
Barney:<br/>Dude, you can't do that.
I have to go down there,<br/>and I have
To tell her I love her; I have<br/>to beg her to take me back,
Even if I have to<br/>get down on my knees.
Marshall, you can't do that.<br/>Oh, really, why not?
Ted:<br/>56 days.
That's how long it took me<br/>to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry, but right now,<br/>you are not marshall.
You are the miserable,
Whining, shampoo-sniffing<br/>ghost of marshall,
And frankly, a guy like you
Doesn't have a shot<br/>in hell with a girl like lily.
You know who might have a shot
Somewhere down the line?
Marshall.
The real marshall.
But if you go down there right<br/>now like this, you're going
To blow it for him, and he's<br/>never going to forgive you.
Of course, whatever I say,
You're just going to do<br/>the opposite,
So have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.
Come on, robin.
(clears throat)
Is it still okay if<br/>we borrow the car?
Bold. Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was too hard on him.
I can't believe you're accusing<br/>me of being too hard on him.
You're the one<br/>who said "tough love."
Yeah, tough love, not<br/>"hand the guy a noose."
Oh, but it's okay<br/>to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah, he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.<br/>Do you know how many people
Are killed each year<br/>the second amendment
Protects my right to bear arms...<br/>In accidents...
All right, all right, all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
(laughs softly)
I'm going to call barney,<br/>see how they're doing.
(phone rings) go for barney.
Oh, hey, where are you guys?
We're at a fund-raiser,
Helping young women raise money<br/>for community college.
Strip club, nice.
Is marshall okay?<br/>(laughs)
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.<br/>Marshall?
Tell ted that...
Uh-oh.
Already?
What? What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.
He's going to go down<br/>to that hotel.
Crap, you're right.
Okay, okay, here's the plan,<br/>here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel<br/>and find him.
I'll stay here<br/>and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...
Barney!
Was there a hot tub<br/>at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi, uh, could you tell me<br/>what room lily aldrin's in?
Marshall.
(chuckling):<br/>Hey.
What happened?
Well, I went up to lily's floor,
And I had this little speech<br/>in my head...
Everything I've been wanting<br/>to say to her all summer
About love, loyalty, respect.
I knocked on the door.
So you knocked out<br/>lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't lily's boyfriend.
What? Who... who was it?
Ted: His name was joey adalian,<br/>although he went by a number
Of aliases in his years<br/>as an identity thief.
Apparently,<br/>earlier in the summer...
Lily:<br/>Oh, this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn<br/>I had some change.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
Do you, uh, take credit cards?
Yes, I do.
So lily's not back in town,
And she doesn't<br/>have a boyfriend?
Th-that's good news, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges
Were the only remaining<br/>connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is<br/>or what she's doing.
She was my whole life, man,<br/>and now she's-she's gone.
You know, first day of<br/>college, I showed up,
And-and I got up to my room,<br/>and there was my roommate,
Lying on the bed with<br/>his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on,<br/>big smile on his face
Like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.<br/>Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high,<br/>I thought you were the dean.
Wh-what I'm saying is
There's a version of<br/>you without lily,
And it's not this.
You can't let lily<br/>steal your identity
The way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay, resolved.
Starting tomorrow, I'm<br/>going to start being okay.
(chuckles)
Cheers.<br/>Cheers.

But he wasn't,
'cause that's not<br/>how life works.
The next day, he found one<br/>of her socks or something,
And then, one morning...
Ted, I think<br/>you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall, what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
And one really disgusting<br/>batch of pancakes...
So good.
Mmm.<br/>So good.

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Marshall and lily<br/>had been together
For nine wonderful years,
Until she dumped him<br/>and ran off to san francisco.
The healing process<br/>was taking a long time.

Then, one night,<br/>he made a giant leap forward.
All right, I'll<br/>see you guys later.
I'll walk you out.
Marshall:<br/>See ya.
You just checked out<br/>robin's ass.
What? No!<br/>N-no, barney, I was...
Dude, that's awesome.
You're finally forgetting
About that short redhead.<br/>Lily.
Yes, lily. Thank you.
That was going to drive me<br/>crazy all night.
Hey, ted, marshall just checked<br/>out your girlfriend's ass.
I did not, ted, I...<br/>That's awesome.
You're finally getting better.
This is the moment<br/>I've been waiting for.
Starting tonight, I am going<br/>to teach you how to live.
Ted, you had your chance.<br/>You're out; marshall's in.
Yes!<br/>Oh, god.
Marshall, being a single guy<br/>in new york city is like...
What's something everybody likes?<br/>Candy.
Yes, it's like being<br/>in a candy store.
You just walk right in<br/>and grab yourself some whoppers.
(groans) yeah.
Is whoppers the best one?
Mounds.
Milk duds.
Gobstoppers.
This went on for another hour.
I'll just skip to the end.
Dubble bubbles.<br/>Nice!
Marshall.
We're doing this.
I am not taking no<br/>for an answer.
Fine. (chuckles) hey, robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.
Ted, what is wrong with you?
He checked out my ass.
I felt like I was having<br/>a bad ass day.
Cool, see ya.
Lily.
It is a great ass.
It is a great ass.
Ted: None of us had seen<br/>lily in three months.
There were so many<br/>unanswered questions,
So many things to say.
Your hair is adorable.
(both giggling)
Meanwhile, barney was taking<br/>marshall out to meet women
For the first time<br/>since he was 17.
Just wing it.<br/>Come on.
Hi. Have you<br/>met marshall?
Hi.<br/>Hi.
Look how sweaty my hands are.
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?
Like, this smelly water<br/>coming out of your skin.
Eww.<br/>It was nice meeting you.
I-I-I hate to<br/>interrupt, but, uh,
Do you like magic?
Um, I guess.
(gasps)
Oh, my god!
(laughing)
Anyway, marshall<br/>here is awesome.
Salad in a bag? His idea.
Dude!
You were awesome last night.
You were charming;<br/>you were funny.
You were totally working<br/>that girl.
You went home with her.
Yes, I did.
But she told me
That if it wasn't for me, you<br/>would have had a shot with her,
So, in hypothetical terms,<br/>you scored last night.
All right!
Hypothetical high five.
Nice.
All right. Tonight, we're going<br/>to go to the bar...
Barney, no, I am not going<br/>out with you ever again.
Come on! I'll, I'll teach you all<br/>of my strategies. Oh, really?
My favorite, number seven:
Create a mystery about yourself.
That way,<br/>they become so intrigued,
They have to hang out<br/>with you all night.
Oh, come on, does<br/>that really work?
Maybe it does,<br/>and maybe it doesn't.
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.
I have something you've got to hear. You<br/>will not believe what just happened.
You go first.
I found a 1939 penny<br/>on the subway.
Just imagine the kind of history
This little copper guy...
Lily's back in town.
And you let me go first?<br/>Have you seen her?
Uh, yeah. I actually went
Apartment-hunting<br/>with her today.
How's she doing?
You're not going to like it.
I am doing great.
This summer:<br/>Best thing ever!
San francisco is so<br/>happening right now.
She's happy?!
Marshall had the worst<br/>summer of his life,
And she's happy.
Yeah, and I suppose<br/>her art program
Was all fulfilling or whatever.
Oh. The art program:<br/>Best thing ever.
Oh, my god.
This is your best work.
In all my years teaching,<br/>I've never seen
Anything so...
Needless to say, this is art.
(chuckles)
I can't teach you anything.
(gasps)
(chuckles)
But the best part of s.F...
Oh, that's what
We call san francisco...<br/>The people.
Even just riding around<br/>on the bus all summer.
It was like a human tapestry.
Hi, I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash<br/>adventure-traveler writer.
I'm paula. I sing in a<br/>punk band for children.
Yeah.
I'm dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
Wow. I'm so happy for you.
Oh, she's such a...
After what she did to marshall,
She should come back here<br/>devastated,
Crawling on all fours<br/>over the broken glass
Of her own shame and regret.
You never chose sides.<br/>I respect that.
She's unbelievable.<br/>Unbelievable.
Unbelievable?<br/>What's unbelievable?
Oh. Listen, marshall.
Ted found a penny on the subway,
And it's old, and<br/>that's interesting.
Way to go.
Okay, first of all,<br/>that is interesting.
Second, we have to tell him.
No, we don't.
He's just starting to get<br/>better, going out with barney.
I mean, how do you think<br/>he's going to feel
When he hears lily's moved on?
She's moved on?
It happens.<br/>I've fallen out of love
Faster than that before,
Sometimes, boom, with<br/>no warning whatsoever.
One day we're in love,<br/>the next day, he's dead to me.
But we're great. Honey.
Now, let's review barney's rules<br/>for mating without dating.
Lesson two, corollary five.
Make a beautiful woman feel<br/>self-conscious and unattractive,
And she'll be putty<br/>in your hands.
Excellent.
Have you chosen your entree?
I have. Sweet brunette,<br/>eight o'clock.
Nine o'clock. Ten... Thirty.
She's walking to the bar.
Her? Really?
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy<br/>of success.
Okay. Hit it.
(smacks lips)
What's the matter, four eyes,
You got astigmatism<br/>or something?
I'm sorry, I was trying<br/>to playfully disarm you,
But I just got out<br/>of a long relationship.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I'm marshall.
Hi, marshall. Amy.
Don't worry. I've been there.
Hold on.
Nice recovery.<br/>I think it's working.
Um, amy.
This is my friend, barney.
Barney, this is amy.
Hi, barney.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Amy, do you like... Magic?
I hate you.<br/>I am so sorry.
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.
Twice.
Twice in a row,<br/>you took my candy.
That was my candy.
I know, but tonight...
No.
Forget it.
You're such a jackass.
I thought you were gonna<br/>call me a jerk.
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.
Tonight, we'll go<br/>to a college bar
Near nyu...<br/>The scorpion and the toad.
I figure
In a younger crowd
You'll seem more mature,<br/>more worldly
And, as a third-year<br/>law student, more smarter.
Okay, but no magic.
How did you do that?
I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.
The next day robin and I
Went apartment-hunting<br/>with lily.
But I need the freedom<br/>to really chase my passion,
Which was painting,
But now I think it's music
Or spoken word... maybe both.
God! Isn't life amazing?
It is so great to see you, ted.
I'm going to get the key<br/>from the lockbox.
Hmm?
What?
She's miserable.
She's realized<br/>she's made a huge mistake.
Her and marshall will be back<br/>together in a week.
I love it!<br/>Um, no. You just
Want lily to be miserable.
The truth is, she's happy.
Trust me. I've known<br/>lily for nine years.
Trust me. I'm a girl.
Yeah, but you're canadian.<br/>Why do you always
Have to bring that up?
You're our weird<br/>neighbors to the north.
You bring it up every time.<br/>All right, five bucks says
She still wants marshall.
You're on.
Five american bucks.<br/>Damn it.
Okay, so how do we get
The truth out of her.
Tequila. It's<br/>her weakness.
Three shots, she'll tell you<br/>the truth about anything.
I hope this is my new home.
Yeah, I'm going to take<br/>that first apartment.
(knocking)
Marshall eriksen, suit up!
No way. Yeah, you're<br/>good in that.
Let's go.
(clears throat) wait.
Empty your pockets.
Come on.
Come on, let's...
(clears throat) sleeves.
There is nothing in my...
Oh, is that right?
Uh-huh.
Let's go.<br/>(clears throat)
Behind my ear.
There is nothing behind your...
Both:<br/>Oh.
Woman:<br/>Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's<br/>killing me, though.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year<br/>at columbia law, so...
Does kill you, I can<br/>probably get a conviction.
(both laughing)
Yeah.
You must be majoring<br/>in chemistry,
'cause what I'm picking<br/>up between us is, uh...
College lesbian phase.
Listen, I got to go,
But it'd be great<br/>to see you again.
Yes, it would.
It really would.
Well, maybe I'll<br/>see you here sometime.
Probably not.<br/>I'm never here, so...
You know, I do have<br/>a phone number.
Great. Nice.
Hi, I'm barney.
Oh, no.
Do you...
Mind giving my friend<br/>your phone number?
Sure.
Whoo!
I did it! I got<br/>a girl's phone number.
Oh, and her handwriting<br/>is so cute. Look.
Oh, I'm gonna take her out<br/>for chinese food
And then maybe we'll<br/>walk through the park.
It'll be so... What?
Sorry, buddy, I'm<br/>taking this one, too.
I'll kill you!
And then, I discovered<br/>this area, north beach.
Best beach ever!
Oh, I've been
Blabbering on about my summer.
How are you guys doing?
And hey, how's marshall?
Give me the card!<br/>I'm not giving you any card.
I swear...!<br/>You are not getting...!
Terrific.
That is so good to hear.
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, hold on.
This could be<br/>about the apartment.
(ringing continues)
Okay, we're way past<br/>truth-telling-lilly
And about to hit<br/>cinco-de-mayo-1998-lilly
And I'm not cleaning<br/>that up again.
So, congratulations, you win.
She's happy.
I didn't get it.
That first apartment, I...
I waited too long and...
Somebody else got it.
(sobbing)
Interesting.
Wow, lily, you, uh...
Seem to be having a<br/>pretty strong reaction
On losing an apartment.
I wonder if it's<br/>because it reminds you
Of something else you lost<br/>because you couldn't commit.
(sobbing) no, lily,
You're crying<br/>over the crown molding
And the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.
Right, lily? Just quit<br/>crying and tell him.
(sobbing continues)
The apartment is a metaphor<br/>for marshall.
Stop it.<br/>You don't want to see
What I'm like when I'm angry.
Stop! Hold on!
If we can't settle<br/>this like gentlemen,
Then no one gets the number.
(screams)
Stop the cab.<br/>Wha...?
(tires screech)
No, wait. Come on.
Marshall!<br/>(door closes)
81st and first, please.
Ah, she does have<br/>cute handwriting.
Ted:<br/>The thing about a hangover
Is that everyone has<br/>their own special remedy.
Waiter:<br/>Morning, guys.
What can I get you?<br/>Shh!
Bring me the dirtiest,<br/>greasiest tuna melt you got.
And a milkshake.
For you, sir?
Gravy.
You want that gravy<br/>on something?
Surprise me.
I'd take you with gravy
If my boyfriend wasn't<br/>sitting right here.
Just kidding. I'm good.
What are you so chirpy about?
She's still drunk<br/>from last night.
I don't think so.
Whoo!
Look, if you want<br/>marshall back so bad,
How come it took you two<br/>days to even ask about him?
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying<br/>to play it cool.
But really...
But it's good, I mean,<br/>work is great...
Lily: Come on, say<br/>something about marshall.
What's marshall doing right now?
Shut up and talk about marshall.
Shut up and talk about marshall.
Marshall, marshall,<br/>marshall, marshall...
I've got to ask!
And hey, how's marshall?
It was such an awful summer.
I just wanted to get<br/>back here and see him.
But I thought<br/>your summer was great.
Not exactly.
Oh, my god.
This is your best work?
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything<br/>so needless.
To say this is... Art...
I can't teach you anything.
So all those interesting people<br/>you met on the bus?
Yeah, um...
Hi. I'm mike.
I'm a buddhist monk slash<br/>adventure travel writer.
(imitating woman): I'm paula. I<br/>sing in a punk band for children.
(deep voice): I'm dan.<br/>I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.
I never got in touch<br/>because I was too embarrassed.
I screwed everything up.
I have no job, no place to live.
I lost the love of my life.
I know I have no right<br/>to ask this,
But do you think marshall<br/>would take me back?
In a heartbeat.
If you called him up, yeah,
He'd take you back<br/>with open arms.
Wow. So maybe I should call him.
Maybe.
No! This is... Ow!
Hold on.
Look, if you're going<br/>to go back to him,
I don't want to hear<br/>the word "maybe."
"maybe" cannot be<br/>in your vocabulary.
This breakup almost killed him.
And he cannot go<br/>through it again.
So, unless
You're absolutely certain,
Stay the hell away from him.
This guy likes pennies.
Hi, marshall.
No, go away. I don't<br/>want to talk to you.
Okay, I know what I did<br/>a couple nights back
Is in a moral gray area.
But the great news is,<br/>she loved you.
If things had gone your way...
You'd gone out a couple times,
I think she definitely would<br/>have had sex with you.
There's no "would" in sex.
(both chuckle)
You're right, I totally...
I'm just no good<br/>at this, barney.
I'm good at being in a couple.
I'm good at being<br/>lily's boyfriend.
Being single... forget it.
Come on, you can't give up now.
What if I told you that<br/>you could relive that night
With the exact same<br/>conversations,
The exact same jokes
Only this time, you<br/>get her and I don't.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
She has... Wait for it...
(voice rising):<br/>Here it comes...
(high-pitched):<br/>Almost there...
An identical twin.
Yes!
A twin isn't the same person.
Of course it is. What do<br/>you think identical means?
"Ident"... same, "ical"... person.<br/>Same person.
Hey, we could double date.
Fine.
But you have to promise me,
You're not going to steal<br/>my new twin, and leave me
With your old, used-up twin.
Used-up?
They're a human being, marshall.
So uncle marshall<br/>and uncle barney
Went out on a double date<br/>with the twins.
How you doing?
Great.
Amazing. This<br/>is so much fun.
And I think me and the<br/>girl are really clicking.
You are.<br/>You definitely are.
Listen, you're going<br/>to have to leave now.
I just talked<br/>with the twins, and get this,
I'm going home<br/>with both of them.
Yeah. That's happening.
It is impossible that you're<br/>doing this to me again.
But they're twins.
You... you said to me<br/>that being single
Would be like being<br/>in a candy store.
Well, it's not.<br/>It's not like a candy store.
It's a lawless,<br/>postapocalyptic wasteland.
I may be your best friend...<br/>Actually ted's my best friend.
But in this world, it's<br/>every hombre for himself.
That's what being single is.
And after nine years<br/>in captivity,
That is the single greatest<br/>lesson I can teach you
About surviving in the wild.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have two unique breasts
And two duplicates<br/>waiting for me.
(chuckles)
Oh, bad news:<br/>Marshall got food poisoning.
What?<br/>Oh, no.
That's too bad.<br/>I really liked him.
Yeah. Well, I guess<br/>we're just a threesome tonight.
Lily, what are you doing here?
Oh, oh, I was just walking by.<br/>I wasn't...
Oh, you mean new york?
My program ended.
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...<br/>It was awful.
It was the worst mistake<br/>I ever made.
I'm so sorry, marshall,<br/>and... Hello.
Lily, this was the<br/>worst summer of my life.
I know. It was the worst<br/>summer of my life.
It was the hardest thing that<br/>I've ever had to go through.
Can we please get back together?
All that crap you<br/>said to me about,
"we need to figure out<br/>who we are outside of us,
And we need to learn<br/>to do things on our own,"
It broke my heart.
Three months ago,<br/>you broke my heart.
Can we please get back together?
Lily, you were right.
All that crap was right.
So, no.
No, we can't get back together.
We shouldn't.
At least, not right now.
Wow.
Okay. Yeah.
Well...
Will we still see each other?
Yeah, yeah.
I think so.
I don't know.
This is all really new to me.
I just got out of<br/>a long relationship.
I like your hair.
Thanks.
I figured new city,<br/>a different color...
♪ ...Wide open road
♪ it was love to us
♪ it was all that we had...
And the pizza there:<br/>Worst pizza ever.
I'm so glad to be<br/>back in new york.
Listen, if there's<br/>anything I can do
To even begin to make<br/>things up to you...
Actually, there may be something<br/>that you can do for me,
But you can never<br/>ever ask me why.
So then I was promoted<br/>to assistant ménage-er...
Manager...<br/>Why do I keep doing that?
Lily?
You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant ménage-er...<br/>I did it again.
I can't believe it.
You gave my twin sister<br/>chlamydia.
You slime!
Wha... Wait, I know magic.
Well played, eriksen.
Well played.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, you know<br/>that photo in the den?
It was taken back in 2006,<br/>when grandma and grandpa
Came to visit me and we all<br/>went out to brunch.
We all look pretty happy, right?
(camera shutter clicking) wrong.
I wish your face would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs<br/>would explode.
I hate you.<br/>I hate you more.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say I blame you.
No, I mean I'm seriously<br/>going to kill him.
I don't care how<br/>unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.<br/>Not now.
Okay, if you don't, I will.
Robin...
Okay, for any of this<br/>to make sense,
You got to understand, there<br/>are three parts to this story.
Let's start with the marshall<br/>and lily part.
As a 30th anniversary gift,<br/>I had flown
My parents<br/>to new york for the weekend.
Oh, I forgot to tell you,<br/>your cousin jimmy
Had a wonderful time<br/>at that spa he visited.
You mean the spa the judge<br/>ordered him
To go to to quit cocaine?
Coffee?
Now, grandma and grandpa<br/>didn't like to talk
About things that were<br/>uncomfortable, emotional,
Or in any way... Real.
Hi, mr. And mrs. Mosby.
Oh, lily!<br/>Hi, marshall.
Good to see you.
I was just stopping by
To pick up some of my things.
Yes, we were so sorry<br/>to hear about your...
You know, the, the...
Well...
Lily calling off the<br/>wedding and dumping me?
Me begging marshall to take<br/>me back and him rejecting me?
I love your hair.
Ted: This was only the second<br/>time marshall and lily
Had seen each other<br/>since breaking up,
But to their credit,<br/>it wasn't that awkward.
Actually, we're cool.
We just divided up cds.
It was all very civil.
I'm proud of us;<br/>we're, we're good.
Mrs. Mosby:<br/>Well, we were all
Going to go<br/>to casa a pezzi at 8:00.
Lily, would you like to join us?
Um...
What?
Well, I-I don't want to go
If it would make you<br/>uncomfortable.
Why would it?
Well, I mean, yeah,<br/>we're... We're good,
But you got to admit<br/>there's that stuff between us.
Um, not for me.
Now it's just like<br/>we're friends.
It's like we're<br/>brother and sister.
"Brother and sister"?!
Okay.
Fine, yeah, I'll see you<br/>at the restaurant, bro.
See? Not awkward at all.
Lily: Hello, everyone. Hi. Hi.
Hello, marshall.
Mrs. Mosby:<br/>Lily, that is
A stunning dress.
Oh, thanks.
It's kind of revealing,
But I thought, "hey,<br/>we're all family."
(chuckling):<br/>Right, bro?
Ooh. Ow.
What's wrong?
Oh, I, I hurt my<br/>ankle in yoga today.
The instructor told me<br/>to just take deep breaths
To get through the pain, just...
(whimpers)
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.
No, I'm fine.
It's just...<br/>This roll is really spicy.
She just wore that dress<br/>to torture me.
Well, you know what?<br/>Two can play at that game.
See, at brunch, I'm going<br/>to torture lily right back.
Yeah.
There's a part of my body that<br/>she's got a weakness for, too.
Dude, you can't whip that out<br/>at brunch.
No, not that.
I'm going to unleash my calves.
That's crazy.
Nobody's turned on<br/>by men's calves.
They're a thoroughly<br/>unerotic body part.
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too,
If I had those skinny little<br/>chicken legs.
I'll be waiting by the phone<br/>for your apology.
So marshall showed up at brunch<br/>with a plan.
Hello.<br/>Oh, hi.
Hey, marshall.<br/>Hey.
Hey. How are you feeling?
You looked kind of feverish<br/>last night.
Oh, no, I actually feel great.
It is kind of warm in<br/>here, though, isn't it?
Oh, I don't know,<br/>if anything, it's kind of...
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
I'm just making myself feel a<br/>little bit more... Comfortable.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
I've been doing all these<br/>toe lifts lately, and so...
My calves have really<br/>been cramping up.
(sultry music playing)
(both moaning)
Take off your dress.
Take off the rest of your pants.
Oh.<br/>Oh.
I really wasn't expecting<br/>that to happen.
Yeah, me neither.
It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?<br/>Yeah, it does.
Why did you have to throw<br/>your magnificent calves at me?
You know you have<br/>a punter's leg.
Well, why did you have to throw<br/>your beautiful boobs at me?
You know you have... Boobs.
Just admit it, you came here<br/>trying to seduce me.
Seduce you?<br/>You seduced me.
You sat down next to me<br/>and took most of your pants off.
You went to san francisco<br/>for three months.
How is that seducing you?
Well, it's not but I'm<br/>still mad about it.
All right, that's it...<br/>I want the beatles anthology.
Oh, well, that's too<br/>bad; I'm keeping it.
And you know the u2<br/>box set I gave you?
Look inside...<br/>All dave matthews.
You are evil.
Smile.
I'm going to kill him.
I can't say I blame you.
No, I mean I'm seriously<br/>going to kill him.
Now let's talk about<br/>the barney part of the story.
This was going to be robin's<br/>first time meeting my parents,
So we were both a little nervous.<br/>(knocking)
(scoffs)<br/>barney, what are you doing here?
Uh... I'm here to<br/>meet your parents.
They must be dying<br/>to meet me after all
The legendary barney<br/>stories you've told them.
I haven't told them any<br/>legendary barney stories. What?
Barney, here is a list<br/>of all the things
I talk with my dad about:<br/>Baseball.
But I'm your best friend.
Well, actually marshall's my...
I'm the most important<br/>person in your life.
Well, robin's actually...<br/>Barney: How could your parents
Not know about me?
To us, sure, in very small,<br/>infrequent doses.
I mean, come on,<br/>you're not exactly
The kind of friend<br/>parents want their kid to have.
Oh, really?
Then I guess those<br/>shoes aren't the thing
You're most wrong about today.
(knock at door)
Um...
Hey, mom.
Hey, dad. Mr. Mosby: Ted.
I know you've all<br/>been excited to meet...
Barney stinson.
An honor to meet the two of you.
That needlepoint "bless this<br/>mess" pillow you made for ted...
What a stitch.
Stitch!<br/>Did that just happen?
Uh, mom, dad,
This is my girlfriend, robin.
Hello. Robin: Hello.
Mrs. Mosby:<br/>Oh, it's wonderful
To meet you, robin.
Oh, you are so pretty.
Isn't she pretty, al?
A real looker.
That's funny, I didn't even<br/>"look" in the mirror today.
That's not anything, is it?
So, I made a reservation<br/>at san marino tonight for 8:00.
(laughing):<br/>San marino.
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.
No. We have to try<br/>casa a pezzi.
Best salmon risotto<br/>I have ever had.
I love salmon risotto.
I know.
How are we supposed to get<br/>a table at casa a pezzi?
They're booked for weeks.
Well, lucky for you,
I happen to know<br/>the head waitress,
Which is ironic because...
(muttering urgently)
Ironic because we both work
At a homeless shelter<br/>where I serve the food.
Where do you volunteer, robin?
What's the matter with you?
I'm his girlfriend, and I'm<br/>not even trying that hard.
Way to wreck the<br/>curve, kiss-ass.
Robin, I'm his best friend.
Girlfriend, that's<br/>like a bad flu.
Out of your system<br/>after a couple weeks in bed.
(chuckling):<br/>High five.
Can I help?
Yes, you can, virginia.
There's a story<br/>behind that brooch,
And I'm going to hear it.
Well, funny you should ask.
(playing emotive<br/>classical piece)
Mr. Mosby:<br/>Whoa! Bravo, barney.
That is my all-time<br/>favorite sonata.
Barney, you are just delightful.
No, virginia, you're delightful,<br/>I am deligh-ted.
And he's just ted.
I'm really not<br/>planning these things;
They just keep happening.
I think I dropped<br/>an ice cube down here.
Ow, it's so cold.
All right, that's it,<br/>I'm out of here.
In a minute.
Anyone up for a drink<br/>at maclaren's?
No, I'm kind of tired.<br/>Me, too.
Yeah, I'm sure my folks<br/>are gonna want...
I feel like I could knock<br/>back a few cervezas.
Cervezas?
Did he fall?
But I want to get up early<br/>for mass tomorrow.
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.M.,<br/>it's my favorite service.
Wait a minute... you're able to<br/>cross the threshold of a church?
I'll save you a seat.
Oh, you are just terrific.
Isn't he, susan?
Robin.
Susan, her name is virginia.
Dude, I am sincerely ticked<br/>at your dad right now.
Last night, we go to maclaren's<br/>for a drink, right?
So barney darts back<br/>into the burning house,
Lifts up the refrigerator<br/>I'm pinned under
And pulls me to safety.
Whoa. You're like a hero.
Oh, I'm no hero, wendy.
You know who is a hero?
My dalmatian, smokey.
He... Didn't... Make it out.
(sobbing):<br/>I'm sorry.
You poor, brave man.
Why don't you give<br/>the guy a hug?
I'm... Oh.
My dad was your wingman?
This is really<br/>messing with my head.
Barney, is my dad cool?
I'm not done.
So, your dad stays<br/>to finish his drink,
But I take off,
Because I have to be up early<br/>for mass with your mom.
Sure.
Anyway, I realize that I left<br/>my phone on the bar,
So I come back...
(mouthing)
Mmm...
(shutter clicks)
Oh, my god.
Is that really...
Oh, my god!
Can you believe your dad<br/>rack-jacked me like that?
My dad made out with<br/>wendy the waitress?
He cheated on my mom?
No, that's impossible.
Ted, it's a well-known statistic<br/>that 83% of people
Married longer than six months<br/>are seeing someone on the side.
Do you know that<br/>when you make up
A statistic,<br/>you always use "83%"?
You think I'm lying.
Well, have you done<br/>any surveys on the subject?
Because the good people at
Have, and they beg to differ.
That's not a real web site.
Oh, and I suppose<br/>I didn't get a real t-shirt
For running in their 10k.
(knock at door)
Hi, dad.<br/>Hey, ted.
Ted: Enjoying your<br/>vacation so far?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, listen, can I speak<br/>to you outside for a sec?
Sure.
So you went out<br/>with barney last night?
Yeah.
You have a good time?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry<br/>you couldn't join us.
Yeah.
So...
What?
Well...
Well, what?
You think cerrano's got<br/>a shot at the rbi title?
I wanted to confront him,<br/>but I couldn't.
I guess I got<br/>the let's-not-talk-about-
Well, you didn't get your<br/>dad's close-the-deal gene,
That's for sure.
Smile.
Great.
I don't care how<br/>unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.
Not now.
Okay, if you don't, I will.
Robin...!
Ted:<br/>Okay, now I got to back up
To tell you the me<br/>and robin part of the story.
We were expecting my parents<br/>at any minute.
One last thing about my mom.
She grills every single one of
My girlfriends about when we're<br/>gonna get married and have kids.
But this is the first time<br/>she's meeting me.
Doesn't matter.
And you'll know it's coming
When she mentions my cousin<br/>stacy... six kids in five years.
The woman's basically<br/>a ride at a water park.
But I don't want<br/>to get married and have kids.
What am I supposed to say?
You know what?
You're an adult with<br/>perfectly valid opinions.
You shouldn't have to<br/>apologize for them.
I'm gonna lie.<br/>I would.
Thanks again for letting me have
The u2 box set.
I know how important<br/>it is to you.
I talked to aunt<br/>caroline the other day.
Stacy's pregnant again.
Oh, good for her.
So, dear...<br/>Oh, boy.
Tell us what it's like<br/>being a journalist.
I'm just not ready.
Okay. No pressure.
Oh.
Uh, I thought you, um...
It's great.
Good. Focus on your job now,
Because your career clock<br/>is ticking.
There's time<br/>for marriage and kids
And all that other stuff later.
Ooh, a piano!
Ted:<br/>You lucked out with
My mom last night, huh?
What a relief, right?
Oh, absolutely.<br/>Whew, what a relief it is
To know I'm the one girlfriend
Your mom doesn't want you<br/>to have kids with.
Hooray?
I mean, did she really think<br/>that your college girlfriend
Cheryl would pop out<br/>attractive children?
'Cause I've seen pictures,<br/>and, I'm sorry,
That girl had a brow ridge<br/>like a caveman.
Come on, she was just<br/>frowning under direct light.
And besides, that's not even<br/>what I liked about her.
It was her...<br/>It's not important.
What happened to<br/>marshall and lily?
They've been fighting lately.
They're probably off<br/>somewhere going at it.
More coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
Isn't she sweet?
Well, if she's so sweet, maybe<br/>she should have ted's babies.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Lily:<br/>Just a minute.
Marshall:<br/>Maybe less.
Robin, dear.
Did I say something<br/>to upset you?
Why don't you want me<br/>to have your grandkids?
Do you want to have<br/>my grandkids?
No!
I mean, I don't know.
I just...
I want you to want me
To want to have your grandkids.
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.
No family history of diabetes
Everyone has nonporous teeth<br/>and perfect eyesight.
I had one schizophrenic uncle,<br/>but even he had perfect vision,
Which was unfortunate<br/>for the people around
The bell tower he was in,<br/>but still he was
A very fine man, and...
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that<br/>there was a line.
Marshall, your zipper.
Oh. Right.
Robin, it's not that I<br/>don't want grandkids.
It's just I don't think<br/>anyone should make the mistake
Of getting married too young.
Why do you say that?
I mean, you got married<br/>pretty young.
That wasn't a mistake.
Was it?
(whispers):<br/>Well...
Okay, there's something<br/>you don't know.
Waitress:<br/>Smile.
I wish your face would melt off.
I wish your eyeballs<br/>would explode.
I'm gonna kill him.
I don't care how<br/>unpleasant it is,
You have to talk to him.
Not now. Okay, if<br/>you don't, I will.
Robin...!
Oh, gosh, let me help you<br/>pick those up, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?!
The only sweetheart in your life
Should be the woman you<br/>married 30 years ago,
Not the waitress<br/>at the bar last night
And not this clumsy floozy!
I'm sorry, you're not a floozy.
I'm upset; I don't know<br/>what I'm saying.
But stay away from my dad.
Ted, what are you talking about?
Dad?
You, uh, want to tell mom
What happened at the bar<br/>last night?
Okay.
I hooked up with a waitress.
Oh.
"Oh"?
I mean, oh!
Oh! Ooh!
We're going to have<br/>a serious talk
About this when we get home, al.
Oh, ooh!
Serious talk?
Mom, what...?
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?
Mrs. Mosby?
Ted, we weren't quite sure<br/>how to tell you this...
Your mother and I are divorced.
You...
What do you mean<br/>you're divorced?
Since when?
Oh, gosh, it's been<br/>about nine months now.
Closer to ten, I think.
Time flies.<br/>(chuckles)
So ten months ago,<br/>you just up and decided
To get divorced<br/>without telling me?
No, it wasn't a snap decision.
We'd been separated<br/>almost two years.
How could you not tell me this?!
We meant to, it just never<br/>seemed like the right time.
So last christmas...?
We talked about<br/>telling you kids then,
But it didn't seem<br/>very christmasy.
I got you a tandem bike.
Oh, it didn't go to waste.
Your mother and frank<br/>ride it all the time.
Who the hell is frank?!
(chuckling):<br/>Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.
You remember dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.
Okay, my head's<br/>about to explode,
And I don't want to get it<br/>all over everyone's waffles,
So I am leaving.
Teddy bear, oh...
You know, he mentioned<br/>he was divorced last night.
I totally spaced on that.
Ooh, no line<br/>at the omelet station.
Lily...
I'm sorry that I said<br/>all those things.
Me, too.
I just find it really confusing<br/>to be around you right now.
It's the same for me.
I think we're probably<br/>both better off
Trying to keep some<br/>distance for a while.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Are you wearing<br/>a push-up bra?
Did you mystic tan your calves?
I withdraw the question.
We're sorry we didn't say<br/>anything about the divorce.
It was wrong not to tell you.
Thank you.
But listen,<br/>don't tell your sister.
It would just upset her.
No, this is ridiculous!
We have to start talking about<br/>stuff, and not just baseball.
Indians won today<br/>on a walk-off double.
Against the red sox?<br/>Boy, that's a big win.
No. No. No.
We're not gonna blow past this.
I mean, I don't even
Know who you people.
I don't even know how you met.
I never told you<br/>how I met your mother?
No.
Oh, great story.
At a bar.
That's it?
That's what passes for<br/>communication in our family?
Man, when I have kids,
And I tell them how<br/>I met their mother,
I'm gonna tell them everything,<br/>the whole damn story.
I think it was an irish bar.
(scoffs)
I just, I don't...<br/>I don't understand.
You seemed so happy.
When I was growing up,
You seemed so...
What happened?
We just realized we're<br/>very different people.
Your father's kind of a<br/>head-in-the-clouds romantic,
And I'm much more<br/>down-to-earth.
So?
Robin and I are like that.
That doesn't mean anything.
I wanted kids.
And your mother...
Also wanted kids.
Robin and I have<br/>different views on families.
We're not about to break up<br/>because of it.
On some level, I always knew.
I didn't even want to go out<br/>with him in the beginning,
But he spent months badgering<br/>me until I finally gave in.
Huh.
Well, when you don't connect<br/>on that many fundamental levels,
It's only a matter of time<br/>before you realize
You're not meant to be together.
But we love robin.
Meeting you was<br/>the highlight of my trip.
Well, second highlight.
Mrs. Mosby:<br/>We'll see you inside.
Sorry.
Wow.
I know.
They love me!
(chuckles)
We are definitely going to<br/>try and communicate more.
From now on, full disclosure.
Good. Good, I think it'll be<br/>really good for the family.
By the way, how's grandma?
She hasn't returned<br/>my last couple calls.
I'm gonna get some juice.
No.
No.
You missed a great game<br/>last night.
(chuckles) real squeaker.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, sometimes<br/>your relationship
Goes so smoothly for so long
That you think it will be<br/>that way forever.
It never is.
Well, we just had<br/>our first fight.
We had our first fight.
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
A few months ago, my<br/>architecture firm was approached
To design this new building...
It's this big skyscraper<br/>in spokane.
It'd be a huge project<br/>for his firm.
And if we don't get it,<br/>we could go under.
So anyway, the head architect<br/>unveils his new design
To the whole company.
No.<br/>No.
Yes.
All skyscrapers<br/>kind of look like a...
Marshall, it's a 78-story<br/>pink marble tower
With a rounded top
And two spherical entryways<br/>at the front.
Wow, so it's the whole package.
(laughs):<br/>Yeah, you did.
Had to.
Oh, dude, if they're<br/>selling condos,
You got to get me in.
And don't give me the shaft.
Yeah, you did.
Had to.
It's a travesty.
It's gonna define<br/>the skyline of the city.
If it was me, I could've<br/>designed something amazing.
Instead, I'm spending<br/>12 hours a day
Designing the cornices.
Yeah, you did.
That wasn't one.
So you and ted<br/>had your first fight.
It obviously ended well.
I mean, you're here with me.
Actually, it didn't end at all.
I started getting bummed<br/>out, so I came here.
It's what I do.
When my grandma died,<br/>I got a perm.
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
The thing is,<br/>ted has been literally
Complaining about work<br/>nonstop for weeks.
So, when I came over today,
I was kind of done.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
How was your day?<br/>Good.
Wow, you're a great interviewer.
Aren't you gonna ask<br/>how my day was?
No, I know how it was.<br/>It was awful.
Ooh, you want to rent<br/>a movie tonight?
You know, um...
I listen to your work<br/>stories all the time.
Yeah, but...
And I don't want<br/>to be rude here,
But my work stories<br/>are interesting.
I'm a television news reporter.
Robin...<br/>What?
I knew exactly what<br/>he was going to say.
I was just helping him<br/>get there faster.
You should work at<br/>a suicide hotline.
And then it got ugly.
What I don't do is tell you the<br/>same story over and over again.
I mean, you wouldn't<br/>watch the same movie
Over and over again, would you?
Maybe
A great movie like die hard.
But field of dreams?
Once is more than enough.
So that's your go-to bad movie?
The number one
Example on the tip<br/>of your tongue
Of a bad movie<br/>is field of dreams?
It's about ghost<br/>baseball players.
I think it's stupid.
(stammers)
So, now he's all mad at me<br/>about the stupid movie.
Robin, he's upset because you<br/>wouldn't listen to him,
Not because you didn't like<br/>some movie.
How do you not like<br/>field of dreams?!
Listening is the foundation<br/>of a relationship.
And if he's really droning on,
You can always practice saying<br/>the alphabet backwards.
You know, in case you get pulled<br/>over for a dui.
I guess I don't know<br/>how to do that.
Yeah, it's really hard,<br/>even when you're sober.
That's what I tried to explain<br/>to the cop.
No, I mean, I guess I don't know<br/>how to do this girlfriend thing.
I've never been in<br/>a relationship
This serious before.
I should probably go tell him<br/>I'm sorry, shouldn't I?
You're trying to do it<br/>right now, aren't you?
What the hell comes before "q"?
Then at the end of the movie
When he has a catch with his<br/>dad, like...
Like he never did when he was<br/>young enough for it to matter.
Can we talk about<br/>something else?
You know what, dude?
Forget about robin, okay?
You're hanging with us tonight.
I've got an awesome<br/>party lined up.
Oh, god.
This gonna be another one of<br/>your weird all-guy parties?
That was a poker game.<br/>What is wrong with you?
No, it's the first law<br/>school party of the year
And it's gonna be awesome.
I haven't seen this guys<br/>since, like, last year
Before lily and I broke up.
So I'm gonna have to<br/>break the news to everybody.
It's really gonna bum them out.
This party's gonna suck.
Well, love to join<br/>you at that one.
But I got tickets<br/>to foxy boxing.
But I got to get back<br/>to my apparently boring job.
Your job's not boring.
Robin thinks so.
Dude, lots of chicks think<br/>architects are hot.
Think about it, you create<br/>something out of nothing.
You're like god.
There's nobody hotter than god.
I love it when<br/>you quote scripture.
I'm telling you, you should use<br/>the architect angle
With the ladies.
Okay, first of all,<br/>I have a girlfriend.
Second, the architect angle<br/>doesn't even work on her.
And, third, I can't imagine that<br/>working on anyone ever.
That's 'cause you're always<br/>like...
(flatly):<br/>Ted mosby, architect.
If it were me,
I'd be like...
(suavely):<br/>Ted mosby, architect.
Anything sounds impressive
When it's said with<br/>the right attitude.
(clears throat)
Marshall ericksen.
Recently dumped and<br/>heading to a lame party.
Whoa.
Whoa, ladies,<br/>please take it easy.
There's enough of me<br/>for everyone.
Oh. Hi. Hello.
All right.<br/>We're gonna take off.
Wait up, I'll leave<br/>with you guys.
Ted mosby, architect.
(clucks tongue):<br/>Trust me.
Hey, just out of curiosity.
If a guy told you<br/>he was an architect,
What would you think of that?
Are you kidding?
Architects are hot.
How do you think mr. Brady<br/>scored a babe like carol?
Solid point.
She did have hair of gold.
Yes, she did.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Hey, carl, is ted still here?
No.
Hey, lily.
You still single?
Yes.
You know...
I've poured a lot of free drinks<br/>for you over the years.
A lot.
Carl, do you really want<br/>to be with a woman
Who would trade sex for beer?
Only if you're into it.
It's on me.
Thanks.
I wonder where ted went.
Ted mosby, the architect?
Actually, yeah.
Oh, he is such a cool guy.
He was here earlier.
And what made you decide
You wanted to become<br/>an architect?
Well, you know,<br/>soul of an artist,
Hands of a master craftsman.
It was inevitable, I guess.
I bet you can draw, can't you?
(chuckles modestly)
You should draw me.
Well, I could try,<br/>but you might end up
Looking like<br/>a midcentury tri-level.
(laughing)
Hey. If you want,<br/>my friend marshall
Invited me to this party<br/>we could all go to.
Marshall's great.
He's just a lawyer,
But somebody has to<br/>push the paper around
For us creative types.<br/>Am I right?
Yeah.<br/>(laughing)
He asked her to a party.
Oh, my god, are you okay?
Okay? It's awesome.
It's a win-win.<br/>Ted got to vent
And I don't have to hear it.
Maybe after he's done<br/>with the talkie-talk,
He'll come over and<br/>I'll get the fun part.
What is wrong with you?
God, I feel like I'm teaching<br/>love as a second language here.
Okay,
You know how when he tells you
Boring work stories<br/>you're supposed to listen?
Well, when he picks up<br/>some random girl at a bar,
You're supposed to freak out.
I'm not freaking out because<br/>in my mind, she's fat.
She's a kickboxing instructor.
Her ass looks better<br/>than my face.
All right, we'll<br/>swing by the party.
Now the party was for some<br/>of marshall's classmates
From columbia law school,
Who by day were<br/>some of the sharpest
And most serious young<br/>legal minds in the country.
By night, however...
(loud music playing) ooh...
Damn,
These are some<br/>drunk almost-lawyers.
Okay!
Seriously...
Who wants to shave my ass?!
That guy went on to become<br/>a supreme court justice.
Okay, where are the guys<br/>and the hooker?
Yo, what's up, ladies?
Welcome to the party. Yeah!
Just need you to sign this<br/>release protecting the host
From any and all responsibility<br/>should you harm yourself
Or a third party.
Then freakin' rage!
Yeah!<br/>Hey,
Drunk legal dude, um...
Have you seen marshall ericksen?
He was with a guy named ted.
You mean ted mosby,<br/>the architect?
Man, what a visionary.
Yeah, they were here.
Awards are nice,<br/>they look good on my shelf.
But none of that acclaim<br/>means anything
Compared to the joy<br/>seeing the sun rise
Over your first building.
Wow.
I would love to watch<br/>the sun rise with you.
I know you would.
It's the job.
Dude.
You should let us<br/>shave your ass tonight.
No way.
Hey, marshall, where's lily?
I didn't want to ruin the party<br/>for everybody this early,
But, uh... Everyone take a seat.
Um... Lily actually called off<br/>the wedding this summer
To go to san francisco.
So...
We're broken up.
Her name wasn't on<br/>your lease, was it?
'Cause if not,<br/>new york state law,
You're not obligated to give her
Half the deposit when you move.
Yeah, that's not really the part<br/>I was worried about, guys.
And don't forget<br/>the precedent set by
Any personal effects<br/>she left in your house
Or dwelling become<br/>yours after 30 days.
(murmuring)
Guys, can we cease and desist
With the lawyer speak<br/>for a minute?
Love died.
The love that made you all<br/>believe in love,
That's dead now.
You should sue her.
Uh, really?<br/>On what ground, kara?
On the grounds<br/>of... Shut up.
That's our attorney general.
(giggling)
See? Marshall's still<br/>hung up on our breakup.
Why? Because I listened to him.
It was a strong,
Nurturing relationship<br/>that I threw away like old gum.
Not that I'm worried<br/>or anything,
But, um, back to the sun rising<br/>over ted and, uh...
Oh, what tasteful way<br/>did you describe her?
The girl with the smackable ass.
Yes, that's the young lady.
So, I know the bouncer
At this techno club, posers.
Do you feel like dancing?
Yeah, okay.
There is no way<br/>ted went dancing.
Ted hates clubs.
Hell, yeah.<br/>I love clubs.
I mean, I was going to<br/>design a cathedral tonight,
Kind of take a whack at<br/>the whole relationship
Between god and man conundrum.
But sure, let's go dancing.
(squeals) wait, let me<br/>just check with my friend.
Okay.<br/>Hey, marshall.
You up for some super loud,
Repetitive music that hasn't<br/>changed since the mid-90s?
Um... Only always.
Let's go.
Dancing? He went dancing<br/>with this girl?
Okay, maybe this is<br/>a little bad.
Dancing is bad.
Dancing leads to sex.
Did you grow up<br/>in that footloose town?
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him that I<br/>was wrong and I'm sorry,
And I totally want to listen
To his stupid stories.
Yeah, think of another way<br/>to phrase that
And you'll be fine.
He's not answering.
Calling marshall.
(synthesized dance music) hello.
Marshall, hi, it's robin.<br/>Can I talk to ted?
Oh, robin, hi.
Um, no, ted's not here tonight.
He's, uh... He's working.
Uh, okay. Bye.
Marshall just lied.
Ted's cheating on me.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a couple guys<br/>who came in here earlier.
One's about six-four,<br/>210, sandy brown hair.
And the other's<br/>a cheating bastard.
You're going to need<br/>to refresh my memory.
Okay, fella, baby knows<br/>how this game's played.
How's a $20 help your memory?
Thanks, but seriously,<br/>it was crazy tonight.
You really do need<br/>to refresh my memory.
Then can I have the...?
That's cool. You keep that.
So these guys...<br/>One of them's an architect.
Ted mosby, the architect?
That's the one.
Oh, yeah, he was here.
And then I was all,<br/>"no, frank gehry.
You're on your<br/>own this time."
And that, my dear, was the<br/>end of that hack's career.
I live across the street.
That is one hell<br/>of a non sequitur.
You want to come over?
Well, I don't know.
But I suppose I should at<br/>least give you a ride home.
Hop on.
I'll see you<br/>at book club, vinny.
I'll be bringing the crudités.
Nice. Giddyap.
Dude, dude, what are you doing?
Galloping.
You proved it, all right?
The whole ted mosby,<br/>architect things works.
Architects rule!<br/>Whoo-hoo!
Aren't you a little worried<br/>that a certain somebody
Might find out that<br/>you're doing this?
This isn't you, ted.
It is tonight.
(neighing)
Whoo!
You know this girl.<br/>Where does she live?
I'm not telling you that<br/>for less than 20 bucks.
Well, I'm out of money.<br/>I'm cashed, too.
I'll take your purse.<br/>My purse?
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.
Okay, fine.
You should tell her
That looks really good<br/>with a chocolate boot.
Bitch is lucky I brought<br/>my small purse.
No room for my gun.
Here.
Now where does<br/>the rodeo slut live?
The building with the green<br/>light, apartment 3-c.
Oh, my god, robin,
Are you going to kick<br/>this girl's ass?
Yeah... And steal her purse.
I can't believe<br/>he's cheating on me.
You know how many times<br/>I could have cheated?
And you know two of them,<br/>and they would surprise you.
(whispers):<br/>3-c, let's do this.
You ready?
Should I just kick the door in?
Those are really nice heels<br/>and you already lost a purse.
Let's see if it's unlocked.
(whispers):<br/>It's unlocked.
Okay, get in there
And kick some spankable ass.
Robin.
I'm the problem.
What?
You were right.
I don't know how to be<br/>a girlfriend.
I took the nicest guy<br/>in the world
And I made him a cheater.
Well, don't stand out here<br/>and beat yourself up.
Get in there and beat ted up.
I'll handle the slutty<br/>kickboxer.
Actually, I'll take ted.
Let's do this.
Bring it.
What do you think you're...?
Barney?
Thank god you're here.
Can you help with this?<br/>I need nails.
Okay, I'm totally lost here.
Where's ted?
Ted? He's at work.
How did you get here?
Awesome story.
As per usual.
How do you think mr. Brady<br/>scored a babe like carol?
Solid point.
And she did have hair of gold.
Yes, she did.
Sorry, I forgot my binocs<br/>for foxy boxing.
Whoo, looks like things just got<br/>a little foxier right here.
Yes, they did.<br/>And you're just in time.
Girls, I got to go,
But I'm leaving<br/>you in very good,
If slightly sullied hands.
Don't go. We don't<br/>even know your name
To look out for your buildings.
Yeah, stay.
Excuse us for one second.
Okay, you were right...
The architect thing totally works.<br/>Mm-hmm.
But I have a girlfriend,
And I've got to get<br/>back to work.
This project is getting<br/>harder and harder.
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, had to.
See ya.
Sorry, my, uh...
Intern had to leave.
Oh, well, that's too bad.
I'm anna, by the way.
Ted mosby...<br/>(clucks tongue) architect.
But none of that acclaim<br/>means anything
Compared to the joy<br/>of seeing the sun rise
Over your first building.
Giddyap.<br/>(barney neighing)
Dude, dude, what are you doing?
Galloping.
All right, you proved it.
The whole ted mosby,<br/>architect thing works.
Architects rule!<br/>Whoo-hoo.
Aren't you afraid<br/>a certain somebody
Might find out about this?
I mean, this isn't you, ted.
It is tonight.
And that led to a couple<br/>of hours
That I cannot, as a gentleman,<br/>divulge to you.
We did it right here,<br/>and here and here.
But why would you use<br/>ted's name?
I've had some recent<br/>bad press on the world wide web.
So I'm taking a t.O.
On the whole<br/>"using my real name" thing.
Oh, this is great.
It wasn't ted.
Everything's okay.
Everything isn't okay.
Look at me.
I'm acting crazy and jealous<br/>and paranoid.
This is how people act<br/>in relationships.
And that's why I avoid<br/>relationships.
Well, guess what,
I haven't been crazy or jealous<br/>or paranoid in months,
And I really miss it.
And thus ended this chapter of,<br/>"let's pour our hearts out
In the bedroom of barney's<br/>one-night stand."
Come on, let's go before<br/>she gets out of the shower.
You're such a pig.
You're not even going<br/>to say good-bye?
I'll have you know I composed<br/>a lovely form letter
For use in just<br/>such an occasion.
Just fill out her name<br/>and then...
Something with a "a."
A... A...
I'll just put "resident."
(door creaking)
Go, go, go, go.
Robin took a long walk<br/>that night.
She thought about how opening<br/>yourself up to another person
Usually means opening yourself<br/>up to going a little crazy.
She thought about how much<br/>easier it was just to be alone.
And then she came to see me.
♪ And I am nothing<br/>of a builder ♪
♪ But here I dreamt<br/>I was an architect... ♪
Hey.<br/>Hey.
What are you doing here?
I brought donuts.
And I don't want to brag,<br/>but they're filled with jelly.
Thanks.
So, uh... How was your night?
It was... Fine.
Nothing exciting.
How was yours?
You really want to hear
About boring architect stuff?
Yes, I do.
I'm sorry about earlier.
To tell you the truth,
I never even saw all<br/>of field of dreams.
I fell asleep half way through.
What? The best part's<br/>the last 20 minutes.
Well, maybe they should have<br/>moved that part up
A little bit earlier, 'cause...
You know what, um...
What I'm trying to say is...
I love being the person<br/>you bitch to.
So how was your day,<br/>mr. Architect?
Oh, I like the way you say that.
Hey, you want to see<br/>the building
That will make every man in spokane<br/>feel inadequate? Obviously.
Wow.<br/>Yeah.
You know, you didn't mention
All the foliage around the base.
If you trim that back,<br/>the rest would look bigger.
You don't have to tell me.
And, um...
Just for fun, I've...
I've sort of been<br/>working on my own idea
Of what I think<br/>the building should be.
What do you think?
You know that time we went<br/>to spokane
And I pointed out<br/>that skyscraper?
That was the first building<br/>I ever designed.
And that night<br/>was the first time
Wow.
Ted, this is amazing.
Thanks.
It's not like it will<br/>ever come to anything.
I don't know.
It might come to something.
You know, girls find<br/>architects very hot.
Okay, but I don't want you<br/>expecting 78 stories or anything.
(giggles)
Barney:<br/>"dear resident...
"the time we spent together,<br/>however long it was,"
"meant the world to me."
"I would love to see you again,<br/>but unfortunately, I cannot."
"you see, I am a ghost."
"I can only materialize<br/>once every decade"
"on the anniversary of my death."
"I chose to spend my one day<br/>among the living with you,"
"sweet... Resident."
"perhaps we will meet again<br/>in another decade,"
"Until then, all my love<br/>from the beyond. Barney."
Barney?
Who the hell is barney?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Your uncle barney was<br/>always a bit of an enigma.
In all the years we lived<br/>in new york,
None of us had ever set foot<br/>in his apartment.
Until one day, one of us did.
(screaming)
It's a pretty good story.
And believe it or not,<br/>alcohol did not play a role.
It all started two weeks earlier
At lily's housewarming.
Welcome to my new home.
Oh, wow, lily, this is...
Oh, this is all of it.
Yeah, I know it's small,
But it's got character.
Thank you.
And I am learning lithuanian<br/>from my neighbors.
They're great.
They're always out there<br/>in the hall, you know,
Cooking and gambling and giving<br/>each other haircuts.
It's nice.
Hey, is that a toilet<br/>in your kitchen?
Or a stove in your bathroom?
Oh, that's not just a stove.
That's a stovenkerator:
A combination of a stove,
Oven, sink and refrigerator.
Stovenkerator.
Isn't that futuristic?
God, I hope not.
Hey, cool murphy bed.
Yeah, it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed<br/>this morning, so...
Oh!
You know what,
I bet sleeping at this<br/>angle is good for you.
For some reason.
I got it.
(man shouting in lithuanian)
That was, something, something,
I am going to, something, you<br/>like a, something, donkey.
Huh.
Other cultures.
Hey,
Let's break out<br/>the fruit basket.
Hey, who ate all the...?
(squeaking)
Okay, we have to get lily<br/>out of that apartment.
Her roommate is a raccoon.
I'd offer her my place,
But I've got dogs<br/>and she's allergic.
Dogs? I live<br/>with her ex-boyfriend.
I think she's a little<br/>more allergic to that.
Robin: What about<br/>your place, barney?
I know it's shrouded in mystery,
But it's gotta have a couch.
The fortress of barnitude?<br/>No way.
Come on.<br/>She's desperate.
Hmm, normally a prerequisite<br/>for the women I bring home,
But... Pass.
One of you guys<br/>is very, very lucky
Because I have...
A boom, an extra ticket
To the alanis morissette concert.<br/>Who's in? Ew.
Absolutely not.<br/>No.
Damn! I got these tickets,<br/>like, months ago
For me and lily and now I can't<br/>find anyone to go with me.
This is what I miss<br/>about being in a couple.
I always had someone<br/>to go to concerts with,
Or farmer's market,
Or brunch.
God, I miss brunch!
Well, I guess you could...
Well, you could try<br/>going to brunch alone.
Oh, you don't think I've tried?
Table for one.
One couple?
Um, no, just me.
Really? For brunch?
You're right. Who am I kidding?
Ooh, the popover pantry.<br/>That place is great.
Can we go get brunch tomorrow?
Of course, sweetie.
Can I go with you guys?
Really? For brunch?
God, I hate being single!
Okay, I'll take the over<br/>on the pittsburgh game.
Oh, and p. To the s.,<br/>I never got my payout
From seattle from two weeks ago.
Yeah. Don't make me call<br/>the gaming commission on you.
I'm sure they'd be<br/>very interested
To know what's going on<br/>over there.
All right? All right?
Okay, I love you, too, mom.<br/>Take care.
Hello, lily.
You've somehow managed<br/>to circumvent my security.
How did you do it?
Ted gave me your spare key.
Spare key, brilliant!
I'm sorry, but you know<br/>I'd only come here
If I had no other choice.
But earlier today, I was getting<br/>ready to go to sleep and...
Sveikas.
That's terrible.
Well, see ya.
Well, can I stay here maybe?<br/>Oh...
I'd let you,<br/>but I don't have any room.
You live in a two-bedroom<br/>apartment.
You have one room<br/>just for your suits.
Hey, I'm at a point in my life
Where my suits are my family.
Look around you, lily.
You are in the heart<br/>of bachelor country,
And as a woman, you are<br/>an illegal immigrant here.
Now, you can try<br/>to apply for a sex visa,
But that only lasts 12 hours.
14 if you qualify<br/>for multiple entry.
(chuckles)
Eww... Is something
Some lame, judgmental<br/>chick would say,
But I say give me<br/>multiple high fives.
Wow, you really are desperate.
I really am.
Okay, you can stay<br/>here for two days.
(sighs) but I only<br/>have one rule.
You can't change anything.
Why would I change anything?
This place is...
Perfect.
Except for the fact<br/>that you don't have a tv.
See that wall?
(turns on tv,<br/>indistinct chatter from tv)
300-inch flat-screen.
They only sell them in japan,<br/>but I know a guy.
Had to ship it over in a tugboat
Like freakin' king kong.
It hurts my eyes.
Yeah. That doesn't<br/>go away.
Hey.
Hey, where have you been?
The alanis morissette concert.
By yourself?<br/>No, actually I went
With a friend from law school.
Oh, really?
Who's this friend?
Brad.
Bro, alanis morissette rocks!
Totally!<br/>I can't believe
I almost didn't come tonight.<br/>Let me guess:
You bought the tickets<br/>for you and lily
Right before she dumped you.
Yeah, how'd you know?
I just got dumped myself.
What, kara broke up with you?
I'm sorry, man. That sucks.
Brad, do you like brunch?
You invited him to brunch?
Yeah, I invited him to brunch.<br/>Why, is that weird?
Yes. That's why<br/>I was all,
"you invited him<br/>to brunch?"
Why can't two guys<br/>who are friends go to brunch?
Because brunch is kind of...
Girly.
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
Lunch isn't girly.<br/>What makes brunch girly?
I don't know.
There's nothing girly<br/>about a horse.
Nothing girly about a horn,
But put them together<br/>and you get a unicorn.
I don't care what<br/>either of you say,
I am going<br/>to the popover pantry with brad.
We're here. We're hungry.<br/>Get used to it, brunch.
(sniffs):<br/>Hmm...
Smells delicious.<br/>Thank you.
There was no food in the<br/>fridge, so I picked up...
What are you doing?
Lily, what was<br/>the first rule again?
Don't change anything?
And what was the second rule?
There was no second rule.
Exactly! There was<br/>only one rule
And you broke it.
I bought groceries.
That counts<br/>as changing something?
(sighs):<br/>Lily,
If I wanted a fridge<br/>full of groceries,
Or fresh coffee in the morning,
I'd be in a relationship.
But I don't want to be<br/>in a relationship.
That's why I make<br/>it crystal-clear
To every girl that<br/>walks through that door
That this is not a place<br/>to leave a toothbrush.
This is not a place to leave<br/>a contact lens case.
This is a place to leave.
Come on, I'll give you a tour.
Uh, no flash<br/>photography, please.
Bienvenido to the bedroom.
Dig this: King-sized bed,
Full-sized blanket, one pillow.
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."
Next we say bienvenue<br/>to the bathroom.
What, only one towel?
What, no hairdryer?
You know where<br/>I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.
And the coup de grace...
Yeah, that's right.
Patent-pending.
And wilkommen to the hallway.
While guys like ted and<br/>marshall may hide their porn...
Marshall doesn't have porn.
Aww, that's sweet.
While guys like ted and<br/>marshall may hide their porn,
I had mine...
Professionally lit.
Girls see this, they can't get<br/>out of here fast enough.
And if that doesn't<br/>drive them away,
There's always your life-sized<br/>storm-trooper.
No, that's just awesome.
So you see,
Whenever a girl wakes up here,
I never have to tell her to go<br/>build her nest somewhere else.
My apartment does it for me.
God, I love brunch.
Oh, damn...
The zucchini bread<br/>is "ridonkulous."
This isn't weird, right?
I sort of thought it might be,
But it totally isn't.
And b-t-dub,<br/>you totally
Did not oversell the eggs benny.
Right?<br/>I mean,
Why can't two single bros
Go out and rock brunch<br/>Sunday morning-style?
Exactly. Thank you, that's<br/>exactly what I've been saying.
This must be destiny.
What are you talking about?
I have two tickets<br/>for mamma mia Friday night.
You like abba, right?
(laughs): What am I saying?<br/>Who doesn't?
Anyway, I was gonna take kara,<br/>but now it's all you and me.
We're gonna do broadway,<br/>bro style. What do you say?
Yeah!
Hey. Did the cold wake you?
No, I've just been<br/>watching you sleep.
Oh, did you try<br/>and take a shower?
I'm sorry, I only have<br/>one clean towel.
I don't buy into the myth
That we need<br/>to shower every day.
Okay.
I'd offer you some coffee,
But I don't have any,<br/>so you're gonna have to...
I'm boycotting coffee.
You may as well drink the tears<br/>of a colombian peasant farmer.
God, I love this place.
Good thing I don't have a job
Because I could<br/>stay here all day.
I think I left something<br/>on the bookshelf.
Whoops.<br/>Oh, no, oh, look.
Oh, I'm disgusting.
Wow,
You're open about your sexuality
And that's one<br/>of the reasons I love you.
Did I just say that?
Oh, well, cat's out of the bag.
I love you.
Whoa, uh...
Okay, beep, beep.<br/>Backing up, um...
Hi, barney. Oh...
Oh, my god.
Are you married?<br/>Is this your wife?
What? No.
Yes!
Yes?<br/>Yes.
You son of a bitch!
I can't believe I let you<br/>enter my sacred temple.
Come on, baby. Oh,<br/>dawn, you can find...
Please, no. Oh, you<br/>don't understand.
(dawn continues muttering) what<br/>have I done? This is the worst.
How could...?
You're not going anywhere.
Wow.
That was close.
That hippie chick<br/>wouldn't leave.
She was ready to squat here.
Well, she'd have to
With your spring-loaded<br/>toilet seat, wouldn't she?
She was freakishly immune to<br/>everything in my apartment...
Except you.
You're better than porn.
Thank you?
How would you like to<br/>extend your stay here?
All you'd have to do
Is pretend to be my wife,
And scare off the occasional<br/>one-night stand.
I know, I know.<br/>You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...<br/>I'll do it.
Really?
Barney, you've clearly got
Some serious mother issues<br/>that have left you
The emotional equivalent<br/>of a scavenging sewer rat.
But, in my
Other apartment,<br/>I would be living
With an actual scavenging<br/>sewer rat, so you win.
I'll take it.
Mamma mia?
Mamma mia.
You know what?
It's supposed to be
A great musical, okay?
It won all sorts<br/>of tonys and stuff.
No, totally.
It sounds like a really, really<br/>fun, exciting, third date.
Ooh, third date.
You know what that means.
(makes bed squeaking sound)
It is not a date, okay.
It's just two bros<br/>taking in a broadway show.
You bros going to get<br/>dinner beforehand?
We might grab a steak, yeah.
Mmm-hmm. Where at?
Cafe I'amour.
Brad says the food<br/>is really good there, okay.
Sounds like brad's got quite<br/>the night planned out.
You better bring your "a" game.
That means no granny panties.
All right, you know what?
You two are just threatened
Because I'm a single guy<br/>moving in on your couples' turf.
Well, guess what?
It's my territory now.
I'm peeing all over brunches,<br/>fancy dinners and musicals.
That's right; brad and I<br/>are taking back broadway.
What are you going to wear?
I was thinking like this<br/>collared shirt and these pin...
Oh, you know what? Shut up.
Can you pass<br/>the arts and leisure?
Can you pass<br/>the arts and leisure?
I just did.
Honey, I'm...
Barney, what the hell<br/>is going on here?
Lily, I can explain...
How could you?
In our own home?
You bastard!
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't know he had...<br/>Just get out.
This is what I get after<br/>I worked as a stripper
For four years to put you<br/>through medical school?
I got breast implants for you.
I...
I was just about<br/>to turn on the tears.
Brava.
That was incredible.<br/>And that
Slap was genius.
You did not hold back.
Yeah, that I just<br/>always wanted to do.
Fair enough.
I have to say,
It's kind of nice having food<br/>around here for a change.
You know...
Nah, never mind.
What?
You're my wife.<br/>You can tell me anything.
Well, if you really wanted<br/>to sell this ruse,
We should try to make<br/>this place a little more...
You know, homey.
Like-like a woman<br/>would actually live here.
What did you have in mind?
(lively tune plays)
♪ bones, bones,<br/>brittle little bones ♪
♪ It's not the milk you seek
♪ it's the sun you need
♪ sugar dumpling, muffin baby
♪ this world is going crazy
♪ do-do, do-do
♪ do-do, do-do
♪ do-do, do-do, do
La, la, la.
Hey, you're home.
I didn't think<br/>we'd be seeing you
Until tomorrow morning.<br/>Ha, ha,
Ha, ha.<br/>It wasn't a date.
Okay, it was a date<br/>and it got way weird.
Oh, you really don't<br/>have to do that.
No, I insist.
You're my guest.
Thanks, brad.
Bro,
You got some chocolate<br/>on your chin.
Still there.
I'll get that bad boy.
Whoa.
Well, it could have been worse.
It could have fallen<br/>in your lap.
It gets worse.
No, I-I can do it, brad.
Okay, thank you.
So anyway, ah,
It's this Saturday.<br/>Do you want to come?
You want me to go<br/>to a wedding with you?
Okay, that's not too bad.
Two single guys on the prowl.
Just keep brad away<br/>from the bouquet.
It gets worse.
It gets better.
In vermont this time<br/>of year is ridonk.
Vermont?
Yeah, the wedding's<br/>at this awesome b&amp;b.
Kara and I used to go there.
Anyway,
There is one room left,<br/>and we got it.
Walt whitman suite, bro.
You said no, right?
Of course.
I understand.
It's cool.
It's the first time I was going<br/>to see my college friends
Since kara left me.
I just...
(sobbing):<br/>I just miss her so much.
I'll go to vermont with you.
That's great!
You know, uh, they're<br/>registered at pottery barn.
I figure we could go<br/>halfsies on a gravy boat.
(laughing)
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.
Damn you, brunch!
This guy's crazy, right?
Look, I don't think he's crazy.
I just think he's suffering
From a severe case<br/>of girlfriend withdrawal.
And unfortunately,<br/>you're his nicotine patch.
And now you have to do
What every dysfunctional<br/>couple has to do:
Break up.
You're right.<br/>You're right.
I promised brad I would go
To the wedding with him,<br/>and then that is it.
Good man.
Oh, I think we made<br/>the right decision
Going for the custom-made<br/>italian sheets. Hey,
If my bed's going suit up,
It's going to do it right.
Want to give it a whirl?
Oh.
(moans)
All right, I'm going<br/>to head out, hit the bars.
What are you going to do
Tonight? Oh, I was just<br/>going to watch letterman
But, god this bed is so comfy.
I wish you had a tv in here.
Okay, seriously,
What do you do for a living?
(chuckling):<br/>Please.
I thought you were going out.
Eh.
After the monologue.
The next morning,<br/>as the sun rose over manhattan,
Your uncle marshall<br/>headed over to brad's apartment
To leave for the wedding<br/>in vermont.
But when he got there...
No.
No...
No.
No!
No.
Ted.
Um, brad got me flowers.
Hold on.
Brad got him flowers.
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.
Oh, hey...<br/>No, brad, uh,
I don't want to hear it.<br/>I do like you.
And calla lilies are<br/>my favorite flower.
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,<br/>but this is not cool, man.
I can't believe that you would...<br/>Hey, sweetie.
Hey.
Aww.
Hey, marshall.
Hi, kara.
So you guys, are like,<br/>back together now? Yeah.
Happened last night.
Uh, I'm sorry, bro.
I should have called you.
Yeah, you should have.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt...<br/>Don't, brad.
Just don't.
♪ There was something<br/>in the air that night ♪
♪ The stars went bright...
Oh, what was with him?
I don't know.
I think he's in love with me.
♪ Fernando...
(screaming)
I can't believe we just...
You and I... What have we done?<br/>Nothing.
Nothing happened.
We-we just went to sleep.
Just went to sleep?
I don't sleep<br/>in the same bed as a woman
And not make a move.
How could... You.
You spooned me against my will.
Hey, it takes two to cuddle.
We...
We...
We redecorated my place.
We stayed in
On a Friday night
To watch letterman,
And then slept together<br/>and didn't have sex?
Oh, my god,<br/>we're in a relationship.
That's what you think<br/>a relationship is?
You were supposed<br/>to be the vaccine,
But you gave me the disease.
You gotta go.
Barney.
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.
You let down your guard,<br/>and let someone into your life,
And-and it actually felt okay.
And that terrifies you.
Uh-huh.
You gotta go.
Hey, you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work<br/>into this place,
And I've grown accustomed<br/>to a certain standard of living.
A certain standard of living?
You didn't pay a single...<br/>Yeah...
And so mr. And mrs. Stinson,
After two weeks of marriage,<br/>decided to call it quits.
Fortunately,<br/>they reached a settlement.
And that's the story
Of how aunt lily<br/>furnished her apartment.
Marshall ran into brad<br/>again some time later.
Oh, my god, it's brad.
Laugh like I said<br/>something really funny.
Right, right.<br/>That's was great.
Hey, marshall.
Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?
It's good.<br/>Hey, I'm, uh...
Yeah, I know who you are.
Well, I got to go.<br/>I got this thing.
Yeah, me, too,<br/>but more important.
So, I guess I'll see you around.
Sure. Sure.
Even if you don't believe it,
Tell me he looks fat.<br/>Totally looks fat.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, when you reach your<br/>late 20s you might be surprised
To discover you still don't<br/>have life quite figured out.
Like with aunt lily.
Even though she was back<br/>from san francisco,
She was still on a quest<br/>to find herself.
It's just that all I've ever<br/>done is teach kindergarten.
I want to get out there<br/>and change the world.
I want to find my passion.
And she did find it.
I'm going to be a life coach.
In fact, she found it<br/>again and again.
I'm going to be<br/>a marine biologist.
Slam poet.
Beekeeper!
Not a beekeeper.
Her newest lifelong dream?
Singing in a punk rock band.
What is she doing for money<br/>through all this?
Uh, she's waiting tables<br/>at big wave luau.
Wait, you mean<br/>that hawaiian place
Where they wear those<br/>embarrassing outfits?
No.
Here she comes.
Here she comes.
Welcome to big wave luau.
Can I tiki your drink order?
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
Barney:<br/>Oh, hi, lily.
We were just<br/>in the neighborhood,
Thought we'd get some lunch.
We didn't even know<br/>you'd be here.
What do you want?
Whoa. I don't<br/>think that's how
You're supposed to greet a<br/>customer at big wave luau.
Aloha, island visitors.
The big wave brought you<br/>to our humble luau.
For that, we thank you.
Or in my native tongue, mahalo.
(laughing)
I didn't catch your name.<br/>Did you guys catch her name?
No.
My name is anuhea.
It means cool and fragrant,
Much like any of our<br/>12 specialty drinks.
Robin, nothing to add?<br/>No.
Lily is my friend and I'm<br/>not going to make fun of her
For trying to follow her dreams.
Thank you.
Although, you might<br/>want to bring out
The big hawaiian drum because I'm<br/>pretty sure today's my birthday.
Birthday girl!
I have never needed beer<br/>more than I do right now.
I thought you said your semester<br/>was gonna be a piece of cake.
I remember because you were<br/>eating a piece of cake
At the time and you said, "dude,<br/>my semester is gonna be this."
Yeah, well, it was<br/>supposed to be,
But my professor's like the<br/>toughest grader I've ever seen.
She had like a bad divorce<br/>this summer
And now she's taking it out<br/>on us.
To tell you the truth, I think<br/>she just needs to get laid.
Really?<br/>Laid, you say?
You wouldn't be into her.
She's, like, in her late 40s.<br/>She hot?
Yeah, I guess she's kind<br/>of hot, yeah.
And she's looking<br/>for some action.
Sounds to me<br/>like she could be a cougar.
A what?
A cougar.
An older woman,<br/>usually in her 40s or 50s,
Single and on the prowl<br/>for a younger man.
What's a woman in her<br/>60s or 70s... a turtle?
Marshall, I've thought it over<br/>and I accept your challenge.
I didn't challenge you<br/>to have sex with my...
Tomorrow, the cougar<br/>hunt begins.
So, I quit my job.
I just couldn't take it anymore.
Approximately 50 times a day,<br/>some guy asks me for a lei.
Classic.
Ted, didn't you tell me
They need a new assistant<br/>in your office?
Yeah.
Somebody did just quit.
So, where should we eat today?
Oh, awesome, you brought lunch<br/>for everyone?
Dude, that is<br/>cold-blooded.
It was an honest mistake.
Look, when somebody opens<br/>up a container
With an entire chicken in it,
It's okay to assume they made<br/>lunch for everyone.
Ted, that girl didn't quit.<br/>You destroyed her.
It was an whole chicken.
And did I mention<br/>she had 12 sides?
Oh, now you're gonna<br/>bash her figure.
Real classy, ted.
So, lily, what do you say?<br/>Do you want the job?
What would I be doing?
Basically, you're sort<br/>of a general office assistant.
You'll sit there.
My station is right over here.
And things are a little<br/>bit crazy right now
'cause we're pitching a new<br/>building to a big client.
Oh, right, is that the...?<br/>Yeah.
Here's the model.
You weren't kidding.
It really does look<br/>like a giant penis.
I know.
For whatever reason, mr.<br/>Druthers just doesn't see it.
How can he not see it?
I mean there's the...<br/>I know.
And the way it...<br/>I know.
And the two little...<br/>I know.
Wow, it is just...
Spectacular?<br/>Why, thank you.
Lily, this is<br/>mr. Druthers,
The head architect<br/>on the project.
Lily's going to be<br/>our new office assistant.
Ah.<br/>Nice to meet you.
Ted, I looked at your design<br/>for the penthouse balcony.
Tell me, do you want<br/>to be an architect?
I, uh...<br/>I am an architect.
Really?
Well, my six-year-old<br/>nephew plays with legos.
Is he an architect?
Not unless he somehow passed<br/>all his licensing exams.
Ted, you've got promise,
But you have to study<br/>what I do more carefully.
Now I want you
To design some styrofoam trees<br/>for the building model.
Think you can handle that?
Absolutely.
So you're going to design the...
Styrofoam trees.
Once again... with feeling.
Styrofoam trees.
Styrofoam trees!
Styrofoam trees!
That's the spirit.
Now, gather 'round.
This isn't just<br/>about trees, ted.
This is about life.
And sometimes in life,
You have to get the trees<br/>just right or you're fired, hmm?
Man, that guy is<br/>a total, well...
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
That's professor lewis's<br/>office there.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, yeah, it's<br/>a cougar all right.
A prime specimen.
See, you can identify a cougar<br/>by a few key characteristics.
Start with the hair.
The cougar keeps up<br/>with current hairstyles
As a form of camouflage.
The prey may not realize<br/>that he's engaged a cougar
Until he's already<br/>being dragged, helpless,
Back to her lair.
Now, the blouse.
The cougar displays<br/>maximum cleavage possible
To captivate her prey.
If you're watching them bounce,<br/>she's about to pounce.
And see the claws?
Long and sharp,
To ward off rival females...
Or open alimony checks.
Yeah, this one's a beaut.
Okay,
Let the hunt begin.
No, wait.
I'm not so sure I'm comfortable
With you hunting my<br/>constitutional law professor.
Who do you rather have<br/>grading your papers...
A savage, man-eating jungle cat,
Or a purring, satisfied kitty?
Go, barney.
Go mount and stuff that cougar.
(with italian accent):<br/>Scusi,
I am luigi,<br/>italian exchange student.
I was, uh,
Walking to class,<br/>but then I noticed you...
Bella principessa...
Tell me what you<br/>want or get out.
(normal voice):<br/>Direct.
I like that.
The name's barney.
What I want... Is you.
Turn around.
My place. Two hours.
Don't be tardy.
I can't believe how<br/>mr. Druthers treats people.
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.
He's not usually this bad.
It's just that the partners<br/>have made it very clear
This project is<br/>make or break for us,
So lately he's been<br/>a little testy.
You know what I mean...<br/>Crotchety.
(laughing)
I'm just saying, it's<br/>been hard on him.
Okay. All right, stop.
Did you show lily your design?<br/>No.
What design?
It's nothing.<br/>It's fantastic.
Just for fun, ted's been working<br/>on his own design,
And it doesn't look at all<br/>like male genitalia.
At least, not<br/>healthy male genitalia.
Ted, you should pitch<br/>your building to druthers.
Are you kidding?<br/>He's hammond druthers.
He's a legend.
I'm just part of his team.
This building is<br/>huge for the firm,
So it's really important<br/>we don't blow it.
(laughing)
All right, enough.
(panting):<br/>Oh, my god.
Incredible.
Hmm... C-minus.
C-minus?
What are you talking about?
I just pulled<br/>an all-nighter!
You didn't budget<br/>your time well,
You glossed over some of<br/>the most important points,
And your oral presentation<br/>was sloppy and inconclusive.
Mr. Druthers asked if you<br/>were making the trees
Or waiting for them<br/>to sprout on their own.
Then he stared at me<br/>until I laughed.
Okay, I'm done.
Great. I'll put the paints away.<br/>You just go show him.
Great. Thanks.
Oh, finally.
I wondered whether<br/>you were making the trees
Or waiting for them<br/>to sprout on their own.
(laughing):<br/>Good one, sir.
Anyway, here they are.
Hmm.
Too green.
Too green?
Yes, the leaves should really be<br/>more of a natural brown color.
Almost brunette.
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise
From a thicket of wild,<br/>ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.
Can you picture it, ted?
I can't un-picture it.
Good.
Oh, my god.
It's gone!
What? What's gone?
My baseball, signed three times<br/>by pete rose.
Well, it's got to be around<br/>here somewhere.
What do you think, ted,
It just let itself out of its<br/>plastic case and rolled away?
Somebody stole it.
Well, um, I better get back<br/>to these styrofoam trees.
Oh, who cares about the trees?
It's just busy work to make you<br/>feel like you're contributing.
Inspiring as always, sir.
Lily?
Where'd she put those paints?
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Um, lily, question for you.
Why did I find<br/>mr. Druthers' baseball,
Signed three times by pete rose,<br/>in your desk drawer?
That's easy. I took it.
Why?
It's simple.
I can't believe there's no<br/>horseradish for the roast beef.
I guess you were sick the day they<br/>taught that at sandwich university.
Mother, no one from the nursing<br/>home is stealing from you.
I didn't get you<br/>a birthday present.
What? You gonna cry?
Huh? Little crybaby's<br/>going to cry?
Hey, everybody, look!
The little crybaby's gonna cry!
(pretending to cry)
I lost my ice cream!
Okay, I may have exaggerated<br/>that last one,
But the point is, he was mean.
And that's why<br/>I took away his ball.
What does his ball<br/>have to do with anything?
Druthers has to be taught<br/>he can't behave like that.
When I was teaching
Kindergarten,<br/>whenever a kid was mean,
I would take away<br/>one of his toys.
The kid would be upset at first,
But then he'd learn<br/>to stop being mean.
Hey, guys.<br/>What's going on?
Lily stole my boss' baseball,
Signed three times by pete rose.
Why? Was he being mean?
You know about this?
Yeah. It's her own<br/>personal form of justice.
Did you tell him about<br/>that time at the gap?
Ooh, that was a good one.
This sales guy<br/>was rude to robin,
So I took a pair of khakis.
I gave them to you<br/>for your birthday.
So I've been walking<br/>around in stolen khakis?
I prefer<br/>to call them "justice khakis."
That's not justice.
It's shoplifting,<br/>and it's a crime.
Lily, your little system<br/>doesn't even make sense.
In kindergarten, the kid knew<br/>why he was being punished.
Druthers just thinks<br/>someone stole his ball.
Well, that's why I left a note.
A note?
Yeah. When he finds it,
He'll understand why<br/>his ball was taken away,
He'll stop being mean,
And the office<br/>will be a nicer place to work.
Maybe he'll even be open<br/>to hearing your ideas.
Look, lil, we're all tolerating
This prolonged nervous breakdown<br/>you're clearly having,
With the punk band and the<br/>beekeeping and the petty larceny,
But this is my career<br/>you're messing with.
I'm not sure I like your tone.
You know what?<br/>Now you just lost the ball.
Hey.
I'd ask you how last night went,<br/>but we had a pop quiz today.
Nobody got higher<br/>than a c-minus.
I know, I know.
You claim to have so much sex.
I only assumed<br/>you'd be good at it.
Look, I miscalculated.
I thought she'd be old and<br/>fragile, like most cougars.
But kitty's got claws.
Don't worry though.
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
Just let it go, man.
You're making things worse.
I promise you, after tonight,
That cougar will be my pet,
And I its master.
I think I'm falling<br/>in love with you.
Oh, god. That wasn't<br/>your first time, was it?
Although that<br/>would explain a lot.
What? No.<br/>We had sex yesterday.
Oh, right. That.
Well, you had sex yesterday.
I revised my syllabus<br/>for the spring semester.
When druthers goes<br/>to get his bagel,
I'll go in, grab the note,<br/>put the ball back.
If something goes wrong,<br/>yell out, "who wants espresso?"
So I'll know he's coming.
Got it? Okay,<br/>now give me the ball.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I mean I stand<br/>by what I did, ted.
Come on, lily.<br/>We're running out of time.
Everybody get in here now!
Who wants espresso?
Now, as most of you know,
My pete rose, pete rose, pete<br/>rose baseball has been stolen.
Well, I just found this note.
"Dear mr. Druthers,<br/>I, your baseball, am leaving.
"Maybe, if you start<br/>being nice, I'll come back.
"If not, other things in your<br/>office may follow my lead.
"In fact, I overheard<br/>your ipod talking,
And he may shuffle<br/>off at any minute."
Normally,
I would scream at everyone<br/>until my voice goes,
But maybe that's<br/>the wrong reaction here.
Interesting.
Instead, I'm giving my baseball<br/>until the end of the day
To decide he's homesick,<br/>or tomorrow morning,
I'll begin firing<br/>three people an hour.
And, if the thief<br/>doesn't believe me,
Well, then, you are gambling<br/>more than pete rose...
Major league baseball's<br/>all-time hit leader,
A man whose absence from<br/>the hall of fame is a travesty
To the entire sports world...
Ever "allegedly" did!
Wow. Looks like<br/>bye-bye, ipod.
Give him his ball<br/>back right now.
People are going to get fired.
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, ted.
I saw this in<br/>kindergarten all the time.
This isn't kindergarten.
Mr. Druthers<br/>is an adult,
And he wants his ball back.
All right, I'll give it back<br/>if you show him your plans.
No. You'll give it back<br/>or you're fired.
I'm sorry, ted.<br/>I just can't do that.
Then you're fired.
Fine.
Here's the ball.
At least you have one now.
Dude, you're killing me.
You didn't tame the cougar.
You just made her angrier.
Do you not see the powerbar<br/>in my hand?
I'm fueling up.
So you're going back over there?
Oh, yeah. And tonight,<br/>just like john mellencamp,
I am going to get rid of<br/>the "cougar" once and for all.
Get it?
'Cause that's what he did<br/>with his name.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Please give me another chance.
Barney, I teach all day.
It's the last thing I want to do<br/>when I get home.
But you don't understand.
See, I've been going easy<br/>on you, holding back,
'cause I was afraid<br/>you'd break a hip or something.
But, this time, no mercy.
I don't care how long it takes...<br/>Days, weeks, half a year.
(sighs):<br/>Fine.
Come in. You can start
While I finish<br/>grading some papers.
Hurry up.<br/>Clients will be here any moment.
Now, slide it closer<br/>to his chair.
I want this thing to really<br/>smack him in the face.
Mr. Druthers, thank you again<br/>for understanding about lily.
Oh. Well, I pity her.
I mean, to steal from my office
And then write<br/>that slanderous note...
You might say that<br/>lily was mentally deranged.
You might say that, ted.
Lily was mentally deranged.
You might even say it loud<br/>enough for everyone to hear.
Lily was mentally deranged!
Oh! That's a bit harsh,<br/>don't you think, ted?
The clients are here.
Excellent. Bring them in.
Our client was a major bank
And financial services<br/>company in spokane.
That still captured<br/>the distinct flavor
And history of the northwest.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
The spokane<br/>national bank building.
That's a penis!
That's... That's ridiculous.
There's no way
This majestic tower<br/>can be confused
With the male organ of love.
We're not building a penis.
You got any other ideas?
Other ideas?
You said you wanted<br/>hammond druthers.
This is hammond druthers.
Well, hats off<br/>to your ladyfriends,
But I'm not building it.
We're done here.
The trajectory<br/>of my entire career
Had I not unwittingly worn<br/>my justice khakis that day.
Wait!
We have one more idea for you.
Ted, what are you doing?
I have another design.
Sit down, shut up, right now.
No.
♪ Thank you for the invitation
♪ she showed me very nice...
To ted! The youngest person<br/>to ever design a building
Over 70 stories, probably!
All:<br/>Probably!
Congrats, ted.
Hey, thanks for telling me
To stand up to druthers<br/>and pitch my idea.
Seriously, none of this would have<br/>happened if it weren't for you.
Oh. You know what, ted?
That was very nice.
You have earned<br/>these screws back.
Don't sit in your desk chair<br/>until you've put them back in.
Hey, I'm project manager now,
So, if you want<br/>your old job back...
No, thanks.
I think I figured out what<br/>I want to be when I grow up.
♪ Check the score...
Casey, that's not<br/>how we treat people.
You'll get this back<br/>when you learn to be nice.
♪ We're number one
♪ ...Back where you're from
♪ wrote this to<br/>suit everybody's... ♪
Barney! Oh, my god!
What happened?
He broke his hip.
That's not true.
It's just temporarily<br/>dislocated.
Seriously, I'm fine.
No, he's not fine.
Professor lewis, hi.
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.<br/>I graded your paper tonight.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Yeah, she was.
B-plus.
B-plus?!
Marshall,<br/>after I've gone through
My eight weeks<br/>of physical therapy,
I am going to get you that "a"!
Let her go.
She belongs out there,<br/>in the wild.
You should feel proud.
You fought the cougar and lived.
It was an amazing safari.
I can't wait<br/>to show you guys the slides.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">So, I guess that decides it.
Yup.
Is not nearly as much fun<br/>as hanging out at a bar.
Man, what's that?
What?
That cute coffee girl<br/>wrote a heart by your name.
♪ Somebody has<br/>a crush on you ♪
♪ Somebody thinks<br/>you're me. ♪
Do you really<br/>think she likes me?
I mean, I guess it's<br/>not that surprising.
Every time I come in here,<br/>I do totally crack her up.
Marshall, here's<br/>your pumpkin latte.
Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin<br/>in this little cup?
(laughing)
I'll have a pumpkin latte.
How do they even fit a pumpkin<br/>in those little cups?
What? You got a shrink<br/>ray back there?
(laughing)
Yeah.
Hey, remember that time<br/>I said that thing
About how do they fit a pumpkin
Into the little cup?
Which time?<br/>The first time.
Yeah. That was really funny.
Right.
All right, there's only two<br/>reasons she'd laugh at that.
One, it's the first joke<br/>she's ever heard,
Or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.
You think?
Yeah, that why you're not
Back with lily, right?<br/>So you can experience
What it's like to be single.
Well, what if the heart
Doesn't mean anything?
What if she writes it<br/>on all the cups?
Mine says "ted," no heart.
Mine says... "swarley."
How'd they get "swarley"<br/>from "barney"?
It's not even a name.
Who would ever<br/>be called "swarley"?
Oh, please don't start<br/>calling me "swarley."
This would never<br/>happen at a bar!
Man! What's up<br/>with swarley?
I know. You almost never see<br/>old swarlz get that upset.
Psssh.
Hey, guess what?
Oh, sorry.
It's only my mom.
She's just rambling on<br/>like always.
Uh-huh.
What happened?
Marshall asked out a girl.
Wow. Well, if anything,<br/>that's dad's fault.
That'll keep her going a while.
Oh, of course, you know,<br/>he had a little help.
Swarley hooked him up?
Oh, good. You<br/>got my text.
Yeah. Oh. No, it was me.
I gave marshall<br/>one of my secrets.
So, what'd she say?
Nothing.
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.
What? You gave her<br/>the look, right?
Head down, eyes looking up,
Hands in pockets, shoulders up,
Head slightly tilted,<br/>conveying shy vulnerability.
I think so.
Look, can we just go?
Pumpkin latte
For marshall.
I didn't order that.
Phone number.
I love that look.
I think I slept with you<br/>because of that look.
And it's fake?
Oh, and you biting<br/>your lower lip,
Shyly looking away and thrusting<br/>your chest out is natural?
Yeah, I hear you.
(knocking at door)
Hey! Hey. Hey, guys.
Are you free tomorrow night?
I was thinking of having<br/>a wine tasting
Slash "help me catch the rat<br/>in my apartment" party.
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.
I should invite marshall, right?
It'd be weird if I didn't.
Yeah, I don't think he can go.
Really? Why not?
Uh, okay, um...
Lily, we have to<br/>tell you something.
Marshall has a date.
Oh. Well... Good for him.
Really? You're<br/>okay with it?
Look, we've been broken up<br/>almost six months.
I mean, I'm not<br/>thrilled about the idea,
But he has every right<br/>to date someone else.
That's very mature.
Why are you holding the phone?
Oh, shoot.
(laughing)
That's hilarious, mom.
Didn't even notice.
Hey, dude, by the way,<br/>I really like that suit.
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, ted.
It's moroccan, actually.<br/>Whoa.
I got a call for swarley.
Is a swarley here?
You weren't interested
In my suit at all, were you?
Hmm?<br/>Swarley!
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.
Could you ask again?
Important call for swarley!
Marshall:<br/>Geez,
Can't you hear him, swarley?
There's a call for you.
Stop calling me that.
Uh... Hey, I'd<br/>like you guys
To officially meet chloe.
Hi. Hi. Hi.
It's nice to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
It's right back there.
Right?
Right? She's hot!
And she likes me?
She likes italian food.
I also like italian food.
She likes billy joel.
I also like... Music.
And I think
We're going to go out again.
Dude, you gotta ditch her.
Obviously.
What? Why?
She's got the crazy eyes.
Dude. The eyes.
They're crazy.
What are you guys talking<br/>about, the crazy eyes?
It's a well-documented
Condition of the<br/>pupils, or pupi.
No. Just pupils.
It's an indicator of<br/>future mental instability.
She does not have<br/>the crazy eyes.
You just can't see it<br/>because you're afflicted
With "haven't been laid<br/>in a while" blindness.
She was too far away<br/>in the coffee place,
But when I saw her<br/>up close, just now...
Hey, I'd like you guys<br/>to officially meet chloe.
Hi. Hi. Hi.
It's nice to meet you guys.
(maniacal cackling)
(bats screeching)
(clocks ticking)
You guys, I'm not going<br/>to stop dating chloe
Just because you think<br/>she has the crazy eyes.
You can keep going out with her,
But you're gonna regret it.
One time, I met a girl<br/>at this very bar.
I saw that she had<br/>the crazy eyes...
But I ignored it.
And then, sure enough.
Barney, can I ask<br/>you a question?
Anything.
Would you like to<br/>have a threesome?
Of course.
Great. It'd be me, you,<br/>and mr. Weasels.
So, did you do it?
No. It ended up<br/>being just a twosome
With the third one<br/>watching from a chair.
Which one were you?
I'd rather not say.
Look, there was a time<br/>I didn't believe
In the crazy eyes either,<br/>and then I met jeanine.
She had serious crazy eyes.
I told myself I was just<br/>imagining it, but then...
So, should we go get a drink?
As long as it's<br/>in your apartment.
(tires squeal)
Whoa, I'm sorry.
Watch! Where! You're! Going!
So, where do you live?
You guys, chloe is not gonna<br/>do any of that stuff.
She's a nice girl from nebraska.
She's not crazy.
She's... She's awesome.
But you can't avoid<br/>the crazy eyes forever.
Sooner or later, the crazy<br/>comes bubbling to the surface.
Hello?
Marshall, it's chloe.
Are you the one who's<br/>called me, like, nine times?
Yeah. Could you come get me?
I'm in the middle<br/>of taking a test.
Please. I'm so scared.
Well, what's going on?
This weird midget guy<br/>started following me
And he was screaming at me
And he had a limp<br/>and a big hump on his back
And the police didn't believe me
And I almost got<br/>trampled by a horse and...
God, I must sound<br/>totally crazy to you right now.
No.
Pfft.
Not at all.
So, she's needy crazy.
That's one of the worst kinds.
I've had one of those.
Makes up stories<br/>to get attention.
Went out with her for three<br/>weeks... her dad died twice.
Guys, she was really<br/>freaked out, okay?
Maybe the story is true.
What in the world
Would make you believe<br/>that's a true story?
She's really hot.
They always are.
You all done with that, ted?
Yeah.<br/>Ned.
I told you to call him ned.
That's just sad.
Sorry, swarley.
So, do just you<br/>and ted live here
Or does swarley live here, too?
Nah.<br/>"swahili" has his own place.
(popping crash)
What was that?
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.
Oh.
So, here you go.
Two pumpkin beers.<br/>(laughing)
I was joking.<br/>They're regular beers.
What is that?
This picture is broken.
Oh. That's too bad.
Is that lily?
Is that the girl you<br/>were going to marry?
Yeah. Is that what<br/>that sound was?
Did you just smash this?
No.
Why would I do that?
Let me look into your eyes.
Okay.
I had a really<br/>nice time tonight.
Yeah, me, too.
Stop blinking.
I like your eyes a lot, too.
Stop!
Hi. I'm lily.
Stop!
Now, I know aunt lily<br/>hiding in the apartment
While uncle marshall was<br/>on a date with another girl
Seems pretty crazy,<br/>but when you hear
Her side of the story, well,<br/>it's still pretty crazy.
What's up, swarlz? No.
Okay? No. No more.
I will not let this<br/>become a thing.
It's over.
No more swarley.<br/>No swarlz.
♪ No more swar-lay
♪ no more swar...<br/>Wait for it... Ley ♪
No more bob swarley, mon.
No more.
No!
It's over.
Do you understand?
Yes.<br/>Yes.
Thank you.
Nice.
Why didn't you call me?<br/>Was I supposed to call you?
Yes, about the whole marshall-<br/>dating-another-girl thing.
You said you were fine with it.
Yeah, in front of ted,<br/>but then I shot you a look.
What look?
This.
That doesn't seem like a look.
Yes it is. It means,<br/>"I'm upset call me later."
You should have pulled me aside<br/>and told me what the look meant.
If I pulled you aside,<br/>I wouldn't need the look.
Well, maybe if it was a more<br/>distinctive look...
Okay, the look isn't important.
What's important is that<br/>I can't stand the idea
Of marshall dating<br/>another woman.
I mean, what if
He falls in love with her?
Well, if it makes<br/>you feel any better,
Ted says she has the crazy eyes.
What's that?
Apparently, a thing women have<br/>that guys can see
And it tells them<br/>that the girl's crazy.
Oh, kind of like how you<br/>never want to date a guy
With perfect fingernails?
Jerk nails. Exactly.
Well, did-did ted say whether<br/>she was good-looking?
I mean, 'cause if<br/>I knew she was ugly,
Then maybe I wouldn't<br/>be so freaked out.
Uh, he didn't say,<br/>but you can find out.
I think her name is chloe...
She works at cosa coffee<br/>on 78th.
Phone call for swarles barkley?
Carl.
Hey, ted.<br/>No, he's not here.
Good one, though...<br/>Remember that one.
Is, um,
Chloe here?
She just left.
You can probably<br/>still catch her.
She's easy to spot...<br/>She's got a pink umbrella.
Oh, thanks, brian.
My name is scott.
Your tag says brian.
I know. Funny story.
So, I wake up<br/>this morning, and...
Yeah, see you later, brian.
(thunder rumbling, rain falling)
Lily:<br/>There she is.
She doesn't look that great.
She's not fat,<br/>but that doesn't mean anything.
I know tons of skinny,<br/>ugly women.
That's right, snotty girl<br/>in my yoga class,
I'm talking to you.
Come on, chloe, turn around.
Here we go.<br/>Turn around, chloe.
Come on, show me<br/>that hideous face.
Damn it!
Ooh, I know,<br/>I'll get ahead of her,
Then I'll cut back so I...
Aah!
Turn around!
Come on! Just turn around!
Okay, this is ridiculous.
(deep, gruff voice):<br/>Hey!
Turn around!<br/>What's the matter with you?
(deep voice):<br/>Hey, you!
Turn around!
Turn around, chloe!
She's hot? I'm so sorry.
No, it's fine.
I-it just makes<br/>things easier.
Now that I know she's<br/>a threat, all I have to do
Is keep marshall from<br/>ever seeing her again.
Okay, I have two plans...<br/>You can help me choose.
Plan a... remember<br/>that time marshall and I
Had sex in the bathroom?
Oops, I got knocked up.
Lily.
Okay, plan b
Is called "chloe's accident."
Just stop.<br/>What?
Lily, you can't do<br/>any of those things.
If you two are ever gonna<br/>get back together,
You have to let him work out<br/>whatever this is.
I know. You're right.
Now, come on, ted asked us<br/>to be upstairs at 6:00.
Some surprise for barney.
Barney?
Uh, swarley.
Hey, guys.<br/>Hey.
Hey. Where's marshall?
Oh, he's getting a haircut.
Oh. For his date.
Good for him.
Hope he has a good time tonight.
Relax, you've got nothing<br/>to worry about.
The girl's crazy.
Thanks!<br/>He'll just have
Wild monkey sex with her<br/>five times, max,
And be done with her.
Thanks again.
(loud music plays)
What are you doing?
I just wanted to listen
To a little music, that's all.
Deejay: And this next one's<br/>going out to swarley.
All your friends know<br/>you miss barney,
But he's gone, and you got<br/>to accept that, baby.
And, swarley, you're gonna be<br/>a better woman for it.
Here's "I am woman"<br/>by helen reddy.
♪ I am woman...
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.<br/>I love it!
You know, I was thinking
About this whole new<br/>name thing last night,
And you know what I realized?
I like it.
You like being called swarley?
Are you kidding?<br/>I want you to call me that.
Do you really think<br/>this is gonna work?
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying,<br/>I love my new name,
So please only call me<br/>that from now on.
Call you what?
You know,<br/>that-that-that new name
That you've been calling me.
Say it.
Why? You guys know what it is.
Say the name.
(groans):<br/>No, I don't want to!
I hate it! I hate it!
It's not funny!
It's never been funny!<br/>I've never done any...
(screams):<br/>No!
Man, he is really gonna lose it
When all the magazine<br/>subscriptions start coming in.
I signed him up for<br/>people in espanol,
But I addressed it to swarlos.<br/>(laughing)
Hey, where's the picture<br/>of marshall and me at the pier?
Didn't it used to be<br/>by that window?
Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of<br/>took it down when you left.
Put it behind<br/>some books, I think.
Oh, well-well,<br/>maybe I should put it back up.
Why, so chloe'll see it<br/>and get scared off?
(laughs):<br/>No.
So marshall'll see it<br/>and feel guilty.
Yeah, okay.
Ted:<br/>But she wasn't okay.
Later that night,<br/>while marshall was on his date,
(key rattles in lock)<br/>(glass breaks)
(gasps)
(door opens)
Anymore.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Wow, you really did<br/>memorize all the lyrics
To "we didn't<br/>start the fire."
(laughs):<br/>Yeah.
Marshall:<br/>Can I, uh, can I
Get you a drink?<br/>I'd love a beer.
You got it.
Lily did what<br/>any sensible woman would do.
And she stayed there,<br/>listening to her ex-fiance
On a date with another woman.
Chloe: I had a really<br/>nice time tonight.
Marshall: Yeah, me, too.<br/>Stop blinking.
I like your eyes a lot, too.
Until, finally,<br/>much like billy joel,
She couldn't take it anymore.
Stop!
Hi.
I'm lily.
Lily...
Lily, what the hell<br/>are you doing?
I don't know. I...
I don't know...<br/>What I'm doing.
Oh, pumpkin beer...<br/>That was a good one.
I'm just...<br/>I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.
En-enjoy the rest<br/>of your date.
(door slams)
She seems nice.
(chuckles softly)
Lilly, what the hell...<br/>I'm sorry.
I only snuck up there because...
When I saw how cute she was<br/>yesterday, I freaked out.
Lily, you saw her yesterday?
Yeah, I...
Kind of chased her<br/>down the street.
Wait, so you were<br/>the hunchback with the limp?
Yeah.
And she didn't break<br/>the picture, I did.
So chloe's not crazy, she's...
Just a nice, normal girl.
Yeah, she is.
And you deserve<br/>a nice, normal girl.
So, why don't you just<br/>go back up there
And-and finish your date.
Yeah.
(quietly):<br/>Okay.
Okay.
(sighs)
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
Then why did she think<br/>you were a guy?
I-I might have used a voice
(deep voice):<br/>That sounded like this.
Why?
Because I didn't want her<br/>to know it was me,
Which I now realize<br/>doesn't make sense,
Because she hadn't even met me.
You're crazy.
(sniffles)
You have... Crazier eyes than<br/>anybody that I have ever met.
Shouldn't you be<br/>going back up...
I mean, you're out of your mind.
You're...<br/>Just absolutely insane.
(soft laugh)
Shouldn't you be<br/>going back upstairs?
I've missed you so much.
(exhales)
Okay, I ran it by the group,
And we decided we're gonna<br/>give you a choice.
We will agree to stop<br/>calling you swarley,
But instead, we'll<br/>call you Jennifer.
Well?
I'm thinking.
How about this?<br/>Mm-hmm?
On mondays, wednesdays<br/>and fridays...
Hey.
Look at this.
That six months earlier<br/>I had walked up and found
Marshall alone, crying<br/>over his breakup with lily,
I found him again.
Only this time he wasn't alone,<br/>and he was happy.
So we went to the bar<br/>to celebrate, and it was great.
I was with robin, marshall<br/>and lily were back together,
Until we got back<br/>to the apartment.
Oh, my god.
Hey, chloe, I...
Guess I forgot I<br/>left you up here.
I was gonna leave,<br/>but I can't find my keys.
They're right there<br/>on the coffee table.
(laughing)
Silly me.
I must have looked
Everywhere else.
Well... I'm just gonna go.
(clears throat)
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm chloe.
Robin.
It's nice to meet you, roland.
I'll see you guys later.
(nervous chuckle)
(chuckling):<br/>Roland?
Your name's roland.
(laughs):<br/>That's funny, right?
Rock and roland.
Warsaw is the capital of what?
Roland. (laughs)
You're monica roland-ski.
Hey, yeah,
That's just how I roland.
Nice try, swarley.<br/>Damn it.
(over stereo):<br/>♪ sometimes you want to go
♪ where everybody knows<br/>your name ♪
♪ And they're always glad<br/>you came... ♪

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>And so, after six months apart,
Aunt lily and uncle marshall<br/>were finally back together.
Oh, my god.
These pancakes are delicious!
Yes. Thank you.
Um, I learned how to cook<br/>while you were gone this summer.
Oh. Do you want<br/>to cook dinner tonight?
Yeah, sure.
(chuckles)
How about pancakes?
And things were<br/>back to normal... Almost.
You may not have much range,<br/>but at least I'm marrying a guy
Who knows how to make pancakes.
Oh, um...
I mean, um...
Well, I realize
That we haven't really discussed
Whether us getting back together
Means us getting married, but...
I still wanna.
Do you still wanna?
Really?
(chuckles)<br/>of course, I love you.
No, I mean, that's how<br/>you're gonna do it?
"Do you still wanna?"
That's like<br/>the lamest proposal ever.
When I did it,
I got down on my knees...
I don't know, I'm just saying.
Marshall eriksen, will you ma...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What?! You can't lead with that.
You got to...
Build up to that.
You got to have, like,<br/>a little speech.
Do you remember<br/>your proposal to me?
I had a speech prepared.
What do you want to hear?
I don't know.
I mean, you could tell me,<br/>like, about how good-looking
And funny and smart I am
And I've been<br/>working out lately.
It might be nice for you to<br/>mention something... About that.
Hmm.
Marshall,<br/>you are good-looking...
Thank you.
You're funny.<br/>Oh, thanks.
You're smart.
And a few tears wouldn't hurt.
Okay, would you freakin'<br/>marry me already?
Of course I'll marry you.
Of course.
But, um, until you see<br/>a ring on this finger,
Don't expect me to put out.
Yeah, right.
(sighs)
(sighs)
I'll give you this.
That was a very<br/>creative use of syrup.
(chuckles)
I can't even look mrs.<br/>Butterworth in the eye.
Oh, my god.
We're getting married!
I know, I know.
(both moan)
Ted:<br/>It was a moment of happiness,
Followed of course<br/>by a moment of total panic.
See, when they called off<br/>their first wedding,
Aunt lily took off<br/>for san francisco
Leaving uncle marshall<br/>with the unfortunate task
Of telling his entire family.
Yeah, so now she's gone<br/>and the wedding's off.
What do you call someone
Who just takes off<br/>and leaves like that?
What do you call that?
I think that that's<br/>a little strong.
I can't even believe
You would use a word like that.
Geez, grandma.
Man, I made a big mess
By canceling this wedding,<br/>didn't I?
It's okay, baby.
You're not just realizing<br/>that now, are you?
God, the idea of standing
Up there in front of all<br/>those people who hate my guts...
Just makes me want to run off<br/>to atlantic city
And get married today.
(chuckling):<br/>Yeah.
Coming up at 11:00:
Are there piranhas<br/>in the east river?
What you don't know...<br/>Could eat you.
Robin! Stop the news!
What the hell?<br/>It's okay. They're my friends.
We're going to<br/>atlantic city to elope.
You got to come with us.
Oh, my god,<br/>that is so fantastic!
I-I don't know<br/>if I can just leave work.
It's okay; mike can read<br/>the news tonight.
Hey, mike...<br/>You can read, right?
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.
Let's go to atlantic city!
Yeah!<br/>Yeah!
You guys are eloping!
Oh, that's fantastic.
Wait, is this because<br/>there's a time crunch
Uncle ted should know about?
I hope not because I plan<br/>on getting hammered.
Guys, this sounds like<br/>so much fun,
But I can't really<br/>take off work.
I'm kind of important<br/>around here, you know?
I'm the project manager.
Ted, for the rest of our lives,
We are going to be telling<br/>the amazing story
Of how we went to atlantic city<br/>and got married.
Don't you want to be<br/>in that story?
Of course I do.
Let's go to atlantic city!
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, but<br/>when we tell the story,
Can you leave out the part<br/>where I hesitate?
You got it.
Hey, guys.
Wow. A pedicure.
Uh, if there were any shame<br/>in a dude getting a pedicure,
I don't think there would have<br/>been a feature
About it in details magazine.
We're going to atlantic city<br/>to elope right now!
Oh, congratulations, lily.
Marshall,<br/>you're getting married?
What the hell?
So are you in or not?
Hell, yeah, I'm in!
Just... I'm almost done.
No, we got to get<br/>going to the...
Well, actually, I mean...
It is my wedding day,<br/>and since we're here...
Ted: So we all got a pedicure<br/>and then headed down...
To atlantic city.
(marshall laughing)
Wow.<br/>Look at this place.
I guess I'll have my pick<br/>of something old.
And something blue.
Somebody should really<br/>check on this lady.
Ah, a.C.,<br/>always in decline,
Never hitting bottom.
It's good to be back,<br/>old friend.
You been here before?
Oh, uh, once or twice.
Man:<br/>Barney!
(speaking mandarin)
Ah, good to see you, too.
Three times, maybe.
The wedding chapel...<br/>This is it.
Are you ready to do this?
I'm ready.
Let's get married. Ted: Yeah.
Oh, crap.
I don't have a veil.
I'm a bride; I can't<br/>get married without a veil.
And a bouquet.
I need a veil and a bouquet.
Oh, my god,<br/>we're getting married.
Robin:<br/>Don't worry. Relax.
We'll get you a veil, honey.
Oh, robin,<br/>that's a really cute outfit.
Oh, really? Thanks.
Yeah, it has to go.<br/>I'm the bride; you can't look
Better than me.<br/>Done.
I'm going to get the bouquet.
You guys get the veil.
We'll meet in the chapel<br/>in 20 minutes.
Ready, break.
You guys want to go gamble?
No, we got to go get the veil.
Or we looked everywhere,<br/>and we couldn't find one.
Yeah, okay.
No, you guys go ahead.
I'm going to find the veil.
So this is it, right?
The last 20 minutes<br/>of your single life.
I'm proud of you, buddy.
Thanks.<br/>How are you feeling?
Great, a little nervous.<br/>Yeah? Craps?
Not that nervous. No, I mean<br/>do you want to play craps.
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Okay, I got the veil.
She wasn't ready to be married.
All right,<br/>let's talk bachelor party.
Are we thinking<br/>full-on strip club,
Or should we rent a room
And have a private toy show...<br/>Whew.
What did you just say?
Barney, no.
Marshall, I'm your best man.
You're not my best man.<br/>Right here.
And as your best man, I have<br/>to throw you a bachelor party.
That's part of being<br/>a best friend.
You're not my best friend.<br/>Right here.
Barney, I don't have any time<br/>for a bachelor party.
I've got, like, 18 minutes.
18 minutes.
Oh, good.<br/>Did you get the veil?
Of course.
And it took us<br/>exactly 18 minutes.
We went to a strip club.
Dude!<br/>Unbelievable!
We weren't there for very long.
It's not like I had time to have<br/>a lap dance or anything.
I got a lap dance.<br/>You...!
Aw, your last lap dance ever.
(chuckling):<br/>Right... What?
Okay, I'm here.
Right?<br/>Ooh.
Oh, god, the things people<br/>waste money on in atlantic city.
Does it smell like<br/>strippers in here?
That's weird, right?
Marshall and lily<br/>are getting married!
Yeah. Whoo! Hell,<br/>yeah, look at this.
(bouquet playing<br/>"wedding March")
Oh, baby, this is it.
Let's do this thing.
All right.<br/>All right.
Hi.
We're here to get married.
(dryly):<br/>Congratulations.
We offer a variety of packages<br/>to give you the special day
You've always dreamed about.
We don't want any of that.
Just your basic quickie<br/>wedding will be fine.
Yeah.<br/>("wedding March" playing)
You know<br/>this isn't vegas, right?
Robin:<br/>Well, sure.
In vegas, the casinos<br/>pump in oxygen.
Here, it looks like<br/>everyone brought their own.
What?
It also takes three days
To get a marriage license<br/>in new jersey.
The earliest<br/>I could book you for is Monday.
No, no, no, it has to be today.
That's the whole point.
Look, I don't know what to say,
But if you guys don't want<br/>to book a wedding for Monday
Or play a round of keno,<br/>I can't help you.
Thirty-five.
Wait, wait, wait,<br/>I don't understand.
People get married<br/>in atlantic city all the time.
Yes, they do,<br/>but they don't elope.
They choose atlantic city<br/>for its white-sand beaches,
World-class amenities,<br/>and exotic riviera feel.
Have you been outside?
There is half an orca whale
Rotting not 20 feet<br/>from the cabana.
You guys, take it easy, guys.
Are you sure about this?
About the marriage laws<br/>of the state
Where I work<br/>in a wedding chapel?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Bright side:<br/>The bachelor party continues!
Yes!
Continues? You mean "start."<br/>he means "start."
We went to a strip club.
Twenty-seven.
Is there any way that we<br/>could get a license today?
You could go to the courthouse.
In some extreme circumstances,<br/>the waiting period
Can be waived, but you have<br/>to have a good reason.
Well, we're in love.
What better reason<br/>could there be?
The last one I heard was,<br/>"I'm going to iraq tomorrow
"To defend my country," but,<br/>you know, give yours a whirl.
Ted:<br/>So, we went to the courthouse.
God, this is taking forever.
Can't believe<br/>they're getting married.
I know.
I am so proud of these two.
After all they've been through.
In fact, that crazy<br/>road has led them
All the way here<br/>to atlantic city.
Ted, up here.
Huh?
You were just staring<br/>at my shirt boobs.
No! I wasn't.
I-I was checking<br/>out the hot bod
Underneath the shirt.
Okay, look, maybe I was<br/>looking at your shirt,
But it's a, it's a<br/>funny, funny shirt.
Hey, it's barney!
Barney!<br/>Hi.
(speaking mandarin)
Suit up.
Legend.
Daddy.
Ah!<br/>American daddy.
What the hell was that?
A... Chinese guy?
Hi. Hello.
Uh, we need a marriage license,
But we need to skip<br/>the waiting period because...
We're in love.
Aw. I'm gonna waive
This waiting period right now.
Oh, really?!
Is what I would say if I could<br/> waive the waiting period,
But, unfortunately,<br/>only a judge can do that.
Oh. Well, so can<br/>we see a judge?
Absolutely.
Really?!
Is what I would say<br/>if there was any chance
Of you seeing a judge today,<br/>which there isn't.
Why are you doing this to us?!
'Cause you're on candid camera!
Really?!
Is what I would say...
You know what?<br/>We get it.
Okay, this is a good plan b.
Judges are people.
People go to the bathroom. A judge<br/>is bound to come by eventually,
And we'll get married.
I'm sure we won't<br/>be waiting long.
Geez, you go to a vending<br/>machine for 30 seconds.
Vultures.
Psst.
What?
Here?
Yeah. Got a little<br/>time to kill.
Oh, my god, it's<br/>the t-shirt, isn't it?
No.
A little.
Something is seriously<br/>wrong with you.
So what, is that a no?
All right, let's do it.
All right. Um, also...?
Yes, I'll leave it on.
Sweet.
Guys, let's bail.
This is never gonna happen.<br/>Look,
I know this turning<br/>into a bit of a disaster,
But believe me, it's better<br/>than the alternative.
You throwing a big, free party
With lots of booze and<br/>food and all your single,
Desperate girlfriends<br/>from college?
Yeah, glad we<br/>dodged that bullet.
(gasps): Judge! Judge, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
(tape plays "wedding March")
Turn it off.<br/>Okay.
May we please get married today?
Now, normally I would say no
To a request like that,<br/>but you two impress me.
Hmm, just the fact that you've
Been together for ten years,
Standing by each other's side<br/>through thick and thin,
Never wavering.
What was that?
What was what?
That little look.<br/>What was that?
A look of love.<br/>Mmm.
You two have stood together
Through thick and thin, right?
You know, man, listen,<br/>yeah, I mean,
What's thick, what's thin?<br/>All... Yeah.
I have.
All right, what was that look?
What's going on?
They broke up over the summer.
Lily totally ran off<br/>to san francisco
And these two just<br/>had sex in the closet.
What? We're under oath.
No, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
He's a judge.
Wh... did we<br/>take an oath?
Do you even know<br/>what an oath is?
Uh, yeah.
Courthouse. Oath.<br/>We're under it.
Guys.
It's looking like<br/>this isn't gonna happen.
No, marshall, we are<br/>gonna get married today.
Baby, anyplace we go, we're<br/>gonna need a marriage license.
Except international waters.
So-so let's find<br/>a ship captain.
A ship captain can marry us.
There's boats<br/>all over this place.
Oh, is that what<br/>those wooden things are
Floating between the garbage?
This is a great idea.
This is gonna work.<br/>Let's go.
Excuse me.
Are you a ship captain?
This is my machine.
I should go talk to her.
No, let me.
Blackjack?<br/>Yeah.
Well, I found a guy<br/>who said he'd be willing
To put his boat in my slip,<br/>so we're getting closer.
Okay, lil,
Why is it so important<br/>to do this today?
Because...
If we don't do it today, I just<br/>know we're gonna wind up
Having a huge wedding<br/>with a huge crowd
Full of huge midwestern people
Looking all disapproving<br/>and judging me
While sipping little<br/>cups of mayonnaise
And-and cracking runaway<br/>bride jokes all night long.
Nobody's gonna do that.
No, they're not because
I'm not gonna<br/>give them the chance.
I'm gonna find a ship captain
And we're gonna<br/>be married tonight.
Sweetie, this is crazy.
You're never gonna find a ship capt...<br/>Hey, lily.
Found a ship captain.<br/>What?
Yeah. First guy<br/>we talked to.
Ship captain.
How great is that?
See? See, this<br/>is destiny.
So, captain, can you take us out
To international waters<br/>and marry us?
I sure can. If there's<br/>two things I love,
It's bringing people<br/>together in marriage
And making $5,000.
What?<br/>Deal.
$5,000, okay, we can do that.<br/>Come on, everybody.
Fork over your cash.<br/>Don't think.
Just do it.
I can get us that money.<br/>How?
Have you noticed<br/>that all day today
Chinese guys have been<br/>coming up and saying hi to me?
Yes. Have you noticed<br/>I haven't asked about it
Because I'm too scared<br/>of the answer?
Well, those are<br/>my old gambling buddies.
Truth is... I used to come<br/>here all the time.
Play an old chinese game called
"shing hasabu shing".
Had a small gambling problem.
Actually, it wasn't so small.
I... Kind of lost<br/>my entire life savings.
But tonight, I don't know,<br/>I'm feeling hot.
I think I can win us that money.
No, we're not letting you gamble
All our money away.
Uh, it's not gambling
If you absolutely know<br/>you're going to win.
I'll get us that money.
I swear it... nay...
I oath it.
Now, I had been to a lot
Of casinos before that night,<br/>and I've been to a lot
Of casinos since,
But in all that time<br/>I've never seen a game
Quite like this one.
To this day, I have no idea<br/>how it was played.
But luckily, barney did.
(speaking chinese)
Do you understand<br/>what's happening?
Not a clue.
(speaking chinese)
(shouts)
Do you think he's winning?
I don't even know<br/>if he's playing.
Wait, I get it.<br/>I understand this game.
No, you don't.
I totally understand<br/>the game, theodore.
Barney, split your tiles.
You can triple your money<br/>if you find the jellybean.
Marshall, please.
Don't you think<br/>I know what I'm...
My god, you're right.
(speaks chinese)
(players speaking chinese)
(speaks chinese)
(screaming excitedly)
Wow.
It's beautiful.
Thanks, barney.<br/>Did you guys see me?
I was on fire tonight.
Man, I can't wait<br/>to get back to the shore.
God, I love gambling!
When we get home, we're gonna go
To a little meeting. Okay?
Why can't I do it just a little?
Okay.
Let's get this started.
All right.
Okay, uh...
You guys want the serious one<br/>or the funny one?
Oh, I think... Serious<br/>would be best.
You sure?
I got a lot of great<br/>nautical jokes in there.
Like how you two float each<br/>other's boat, stuff like that.
Yeah, serious is probably good.
All right.
"We stand witness today
"to celebrate the union of lily
"and marshall.
"Today, you two will become one,
"sharing your lives,
"the happiness, the sadness,
The frustrations<br/>and the joy..."
This is pretty cool.
I can't believe you<br/>never want to get married.
I never said "never."
"...To declare your love
"and devotion to each other
"in front of friends and family,
All the people<br/>who matter most to you."
What was that?
What was what?
That little look.
You two just shared a look.
We don't want to do this.
We don't.
Are you kidding me?
You guys are calling off<br/>another wedding?
After I spent all this money
On a bridesmaid shirt?
Did I bet someone<br/>that they'd call it off?
I did, didn't I?<br/>Who'd I bet?
You actually expect<br/>any of us are gonna
Come to your third wedding?
Yes. 'cause it's<br/>gonna be amazing.
Look, before I was afraid
To face marshall's family<br/>and-and I didn't
Want to do all that work,
But now that we're here...
I realize that I have<br/>to face marshall's family
And I really want<br/>to do all that work.
So do I.
And yeah...
My family might still<br/>be upset with you.
But when they see us up there,
They're gonna see<br/>how much we love each other
And none of that<br/>other stuff is gonna matter.
I love you, marshmallow.
I love you, too, lily pad.
I now pronounce you<br/>man and wife.
What?!<br/>What?!
What, is that not right?
Are... We married?
Did you just marry us?<br/>Weren't you listening?
We don't want to be married.
Uh... I-I suppose
I could unpronounce you.
Both: Unpronounce us.<br/>Unpronounce us!
All right, I unpronounce<br/>you man and wife.
Oh, whew...<br/>That was close.
Uncle marshall and aunt lily<br/>got married for 12 seconds
Somewhere off the coast<br/>of atlantic city.

Hey, guys. Both: Hey.

Is robin here?

You're scared of<br/>the seven dwarfs?
Just doc. He's creepy.
I mean the guy went<br/>to medical school.
What's he doing living<br/>with six coal miners?
I couldn't sleep last night.<br/>I bet you guys couldn't either.
Why?<br/>Uh...
Only the gala event
For the grand opening<br/>of sharper image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my e-mail?
No, I blocked your address
After the fourth time<br/>you sent me the video
Of the monkey<br/>sniffing his own butt.
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you<br/>foot massagers
And one of you<br/>a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.
Come on,
Let's go!
Okay, I'm in.
To the willowbrook mall!
Guys: To the willowbrook mall.<br/>Oh, it's
At a mall?
I'm not going.
What? Why not?
I just don't feel like
Going to a mall.
We can split a cinnabon.
No, I'm really not going to go.
Come on, it'll be fun.
No, I don't go to malls!
Sorry, I just don't like malls.
Why not?
I'd rather not say.
Sharper images. But that's<br/>where clothes live.
Guys, guys, guys,<br/>robin doesn't like malls.
If she doesn't want to tell us<br/>why, she doesn't have to.
I think we should all
Just respect her privacy.
Thanks, ted.
So, what's the deal<br/>with you and malls?
I thought you said that,<br/>if I didn't
Want to talk about it,<br/>I didn't have to.
Yeah, with those people.
But I'm your boyfriend.<br/>Come on. What is it?
Did you get arrested at a mall?
No.
Dumped at a mall?<br/>Ted.
Found out you were<br/>canadian at a mall?
Let it go. Trapped<br/>under a fake boulder
At a mall?<br/>Let it go.
Mauled at the mall?
Let it go!
And who gets trapped
Under a fake boulder<br/>at the mall?
Not me in ohio when I was nine,
That's for sure.
Why won't robin tell me<br/>why she hates malls?
Ted, you should be happy<br/>robin has a secret.
The more you learn<br/>about a person,
The better chance<br/>you have of hitting
The fatal "oh" moment.
Yeah, that moment when you<br/>find out that one detail
About a person that is going<br/>to be a deal breaker.
It's a promise ring.
I made a pact with god to stay<br/>a virgin till I'm married.
Oh.
I don't have an eating disorder.
It's just when I put food<br/>in my mouth,
I chew it,<br/>and then I spit it out.
Oh.
I just turned 30.<br/>Oh.
So trust me,
You want to postpone knowing<br/>anything about each other
For as long as possible.<br/>Mm. I disagree.
If there is some<br/>potential "oh" moment,
I want to know about it<br/>right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?
I now pronounce you,<br/>man and wife.
I love you.
I used to be a dude.
Yeah, I agree with ted.
In a real relationship,<br/>you share everything.
That's why marshall and<br/>I don't keep any secrets.
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter. Go play<br/>a song on the jukebox.
They tell each other everything.
I can think of tons of things,
There's no way<br/>marshall's told you.
Try me.
Do you know about the time<br/>marshall was in trenton?
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.
Bill's bachelor<br/>party in memphis?
Oh, when they had to pump out
All the nickels<br/>from his stomach?
Wow. Okay. Seattle.
Trick question.
Marshall's never been<br/>to the pacific northwest
Because he's afraid<br/>of sasquatch.
Damn.
I'm not afraid of sasquatch,
I just think we should<br/>all be on alert.
Not only do they tell<br/>each other everything,
They want to know everything.
So after the shower<br/>I was brushing my teeth.
And I was like, "oh, man!"
I wanted to have<br/>some orange juice.
"I should have<br/>done that first."
But I already had the<br/>toothpaste on the toothbrush.
So I just went ahead<br/>and brushed them anyway.
What happened next?
Yeah, meanwhile,<br/>robin tells me nothing.
Fine.
Do you want to know what<br/>robin's secret is?
You know?
Of course I know.
Her face got flushed...<br/>That's shame, my friend.
Our friend robin used to<br/>do porn, wait for it...
Ography.
Yeah, we didn't really<br/>need to wait for that.
And it's ridiculous.
I don't know.<br/>He could be right.
She does have the fake<br/>orgasm noises down.
Hey!
What? The walls are thin.
That's not what<br/>I'm "hey" ing you about.
You know what it might be?
This is going to sound
A little crazy but what<br/>if robin is married?
Married?
What does that have<br/>to do with the mall?
Well, maybe she got<br/>married at the mall.
A ton of people get married<br/>at the mall of america.
It's great.
There's this gorgeous indoor<br/>golf course for pictures,
Numerous fine dining options,<br/>and talk about a reasonable...
We are not getting married<br/>at the mall.
Well, just meet with the guy.
She's not married.<br/>Robin hates marriage.
Because she already got married.
At the mall.
No,
Because before robin moved<br/>to new york, she...
What was she doing?
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about canada,<br/>she kind of clams up.
She's a pretty private person.
Except when she's<br/>talking about...
Oh, a friend of mine in canada<br/>got married way too young
And it really turned her off<br/>to marriage.
What do you think<br/>of this wedding cake?
Oh, I like it.
Hey, you remember that friend<br/>of mine in canada
Who got married way too young?
Her wedding cake was a<br/>mrs. Field's giant cookie.
My friend in canada<br/>who got married
Way too young, they had<br/>to do their vows twice,
Once in french.
They speak french there, too?
God, that place is a mess.
So you don't think there's<br/>any "friend" from canada?
Oh, I'm sure there is.
Just like I have a "friend"
Who wet his bed till he was ten.
Use your brain, ted.
Guys, there's no way<br/>robin is married.
It's ludicrous to<br/>even suggest it.
Thank you, barney.<br/>'cause it's porn.
I need another beer.
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything<br/>that she's married.
$20,000 says it's porn.
I don't have $20,000.
Well, then what do you have?
Well...<br/>No.
I've got it.
The ultimate wager...<br/>Slap bet.
Oh, slap bet. We used to<br/>do those when I was a kid.
Whoever is right gets<br/>to slap the other person
In the face as hard<br/>as they possibly can...
But no rings.
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature. You can<br/>be slap bet commissioner.
Ooh, I love it.<br/>What are my powers?
Um, if a problem arises<br/>and we need a ruling,
That's your job.<br/>But...
You have to be unbiased
And put the integrity<br/>of slap bet above all else.
This is an honor you will take<br/>with you to your grave.
On your tombstone, it will read,
"lily aldrin, caring wife,<br/>loving friend,
Slap bet commissioner."
And your tombstone will read
"got slapped by marshall,<br/>so hard he died."
What if I just ask robin point<br/>blank if she has a husband?
You said you would<br/>respect her privacy,
So maybe you should<br/>just drop it.
Yeah, you're right.
Husband.
There's no "p" in husband.
Wow, you seem to know a lot<br/>about husbands.
Fine. I'll<br/>take it back.
Oh, hey, since you<br/>mentioned husbands,
This is great,<br/>you're going to love this.
Marshall, you know marshall.<br/>He thinks that the reason
You didn't want to go to<br/>the mall the other day
Is because you got married<br/>at a mall
And have a husband in canada.
Huh.
I told him he's crazy.<br/>Because he's crazy, right?
I mean, how crazy is that?
Are you asking me<br/>if I'm married?
Well, you can ask me.
Nope, I'm not married.<br/>Your turn.
What happened<br/>to respecting my privacy?
Look, just say,<br/>"no, I'm not married."
Ted, I don't understand<br/>why you can't... just
Say, "no, I'm not married."
I can't.
Marshall's right.
I was young and I got married.
It was a mistake<br/>and he moved away, but... Yeah.
I'm married.
Oh.
You have a husband?
I was young and stupid
And we got married at a mall<br/>and we broke up at a mall
And I... I haven't been<br/>to a mall since.
Why didn't you get divorced?
He moved to hong kong for work<br/>and I was like...
Eh, good enough.
Good enough? That's<br/>not good enough.
You order pancakes, you get<br/>waffles, that's good enough.
Look, I haven't seen him<br/>in years.
(sighs) it's just
A part of my life<br/>I want to forget.
Just please don't tell<br/>anyone about this.
Okay.
Dude, your hand is monstrous.<br/>Yeah, well,
What'd you expect?<br/>You've seen my penis.
I can't believe you told us<br/>robin's secret.
How could I keep something<br/>like that to myself?
And you begged me to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Just tell us.<br/>I'm begging you.
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please please<br/>please please... fine.
Robin's married.
Yeah, well, you still<br/>shouldn't have told us.
I mean, what kind<br/>of boyfriend are you?
See that's just it,<br/>I'm not the boyfriend.
I'm the mistress.<br/>No, not the mistress.
The mastress.
The master. What<br/>do you call it?
Uh, pretty sure we're going<br/>to call it mistress.
What am I going to do?<br/>My girlfriend's married.
Do I ask her to get a divorce?
Ted, even if she is married,<br/>it's a canadian marriage.
It's like their money,<br/>or their army.
Nobody takes it seriously.
It's serious to me.
You know what,<br/>in some countries,
If you been separated for<br/>longer than five years,
Technically, you're<br/>no longer married.
I can check it out at the<br/>law library at school.
I can see my hand<br/>print on your face.
Don't get too cocky, slappy.
A shipment of porn from canada
I won the bet. Why are<br/>you still searching?
Just because you were right<br/>doesn't mean I'm wrong.
Oh, right, like you need<br/>an excuse to watch porn.
Canadian porn.
Trust me when I tell you their<br/>universal health care system
Doesn't cover breast implants.
If I have to sit through one<br/>more flat-chested nova scotian
Riding a mountie<br/>on the back of a zamboni
I'll go oot of my mind.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Listen, dude, I got<br/>to talk to you,
But you got to promise me<br/>that you won't tell barney.
Fine, I won't tell barney.
What is it?
Robin's not married.
What?
Why would she tell me she was?
I don't know, but I cross-<br/>checked every record in canada.
There's no record of her<br/>ever being married.
There must be some mistake.
I promise you.<br/>She's not married.
She's not great<br/>at parking legally either.
So she lied to me? Wha...
What am I going to do?
I-I can't confront her,<br/>'cause then
She'll know I told you.
You got to lawyer her.
You got to ask her<br/>a bunch of questions,
Try to trip her up,<br/>maybe make her feel guilty,
Whatever it takes to get<br/>a confession out of her.
Thanks for telling<br/>me your secret.
It means so much to me,<br/>that you could be so...
God, what's the word<br/>I'm looking for? Honest.
Mm, thanks, ted.
Yeah. You know<br/>what's probably
The best part<br/>about your honesty?
How truthful it is.
I say we just move on.
Well, for me to<br/>get total closure
On this whole "my girlfriend<br/>has a husband" thing,
I think I might need
A little bit more information,
Like what month<br/>did you get married?
June.
We had a June wedding.
Ah, canada in June.
That's the dream.
Mm-hmm.
Sit-down or buffet?
Um...<br/>Well, it's...
(chuckling):<br/>Weird that you don't remember.
No, I just didn't know<br/>how to answer
Because we did butlered<br/>hors d'oeuvres in the atrium,
But the actual dinner was<br/>a buffet in the food court
Featuring a filet mignon
Or a roasted<br/>potato-crusted salmon
With a lobster scallion<br/>beurre blanc.
Hmm.
Band or dj?
A string quartet played<br/>at the ceremony,
But for the actual reception,<br/>we had a seven-piece band.
We paid extra for the sax
'cause I just love<br/>that smooth alto sound.
How many bridesmaids?
Seven.<br/>Flowers?
Azaleas.<br/>Color scheme?
Dusty rose and sienna.
Husband's name.
Um...
You were never married!
Yes, I was.
No, you weren't.<br/>How do you know?
I looked it up at the library.
What library?
The one on fifth.
When did you go?
Today at lunch, and I had
An apple brie panini<br/>with potato salad...
I'm not questioning<br/>the lunch part, ted.
What database did you use?
I used the canadian<br/>mall marriage 6000.
Fine, marshall looked<br/>it up at school.
You told marshall?!<br/>You lied to me!
See, this is why I don't<br/>tell people secrets.
You were supposed to be
The one person I trusted
The most and even you<br/>couldn't keep a secret.
But it was a fake secret.
Yeah, I was testing<br/>you and you failed.
And now you're never gonna know<br/>why I don't go to the mall.
And it's good, too.
You were testing me?
That's insane.<br/>Oh, yeah?
How long did it take for you
To tell marshall<br/>my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?
That wasn't a real secret!<br/>Yeah, but it could have been.
You are driving me crazy!
No wonder your fake<br/>husband moved to hong kong.
He moved there for business.
You.
You got something to say to me?
What are you talking about?
I know robin was never<br/>really married.
How could you possibly<br/>know that?
And then I put on my<br/>pajamas and got into bed.
Oh, let's see, uh, first<br/>I took the subway to school.
Then I got a bagel.
Then I went to the library
And found out robin<br/>was never married. Crazy.
Then I was hungry again,
So I went down<br/>to the vending machine,
But by the time<br/>I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.
(laughing)
You told him?
I had to;<br/>I'm slap bet commissioner.
Believe me,
This hurts me more<br/>than it's gonna hurt you.
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing<br/>on a tree trunk.
Barney gets three slaps.<br/>Three?
One because you lied and two<br/>for being prematurely slapped.
Three slaps.
But...
(grunts)
Oh, my god.
Are you gonna cry?
No.
(crying):<br/>You're gonna cry.
I just don't think it's healthy
To keep big secrets<br/>in a relationship.
My parents didn't really talk<br/>to each other for 30 years
And now they're divorced.
I have shared more<br/>of myself with you
Than I've ever shared<br/>with anyone.
For this one secret, which<br/>has nothing to do with us,
To just be mine.
So I just got a very<br/>interesting phone call.
What are you talking about?<br/>I know robin's secret.
What?<br/>That's right.
I know your secret, robin.
Or should I say robin sparkles?
How do you know that name?
Because I know the truth,
And I am about to show<br/>it to you right now.
Gather 'round, ted,<br/>you're gonna want to see this.
Yeah, no, I don't.<br/>What?
Robin wants to keep this<br/>a secret,
So it's gonna stay a secret.
Yeah, it's not gonna stay<br/>a secret.
You see, in my research,
I came upon a certain<br/>gentleman in malaysia
Who is in possession<br/>of a certain videotape.
He just e-mailed me
That it will be up and running<br/>on myspace in about...
(gasps) Right now.
Robin's world is about<br/>to be turned upside-down.
I mean, I'm guessing.
Barney, don't, okay?
Robin, please don't panic.
I'm only gonna show enough to<br/>prove to marshall I was right.
No, barney, I said<br/>we're not watching this.
No, it's time.
Look, I appreciate<br/>what you're trying to do,
There's no point in trying<br/>to hide it anymore.
Let's just watch it<br/>and be done with it.
Are you as terrified as I am?
I don't want to<br/>get slapped again.
I want to stress<br/>that I was young.
Yeah, you were.
And I didn't know any better.
They never do.
And it started out<br/>as an innocent modeling job.
It always does.
Please, mr. Johnson.
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.
Please don't give me detention.
Isn't there something I can<br/>do to make it up to you?
Oh, my god.
Well, obviously,<br/>I've been proven right,
So in the interest of robin's<br/>dignity, I won't show anymore.
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.
Uh, I slap bet marshall<br/>that you did porn, so I win.
Porn?<br/>I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.
Robin (on video):<br/>I know.
How about I...
Sing you a song?
('80s synth-pop music plays)
Let's go to the mall, everybody!
(giggles)
♪ come on, jessica
♪ come on, tori
I was a teenage pop star<br/>in canada.
♪ Put on your jelly bracelets
♪ and your cool graffiti coat
♪ at the mall, having fun
♪ is what it's all aboot
This is the most amazing<br/>thing I've ever seen.
That's you?
Yes, I had one minor hit.
I had to go all over canada<br/>and sing this song in malls.
For a whole year,
I lived off of orange juliuses<br/>and wetzel's pretzels.
♪ Everybody come and play
♪ throw every last care away
♪ today
If this is the '90s, why<br/>does it look like 1986?
The '80s didn't come to canada<br/>till, like, '93.
Taking a break from the first
Of many, many viewings,
I can't help but notice
That this isn't porn.
And yet,
A slap occurred<br/>without the permission
Of the slap bet commissioner.
Looks like somebody suffered
From premature slapulation.
Oh, my god, robin's rapping.
Guys, robin's rapping.
♪ Went to the mall<br/>with a couple of friends ♪
♪ I had a whole week's<br/>allowance to spend ♪
Okay, I'm going to<br/>give you a choice.
Either ten slaps<br/>right now in a row,
Or five slaps that<br/>can be doled out
At any point from<br/>here to eternity.
Ted and marshall:<br/>Ooh...
You go with the ten now.
No way, why get ten<br/>when you can get five?
Yeah, but the constant fear<br/>of knowing that at any moment,
You could get slapped in the<br/>face, would drive you crazy.
I'm going to go<br/>with the five for eternity.
Good call.<br/>Horrible call.
Relax, dude, I'm just going<br/>for my soda, man.
Take it easy.
This is going to be fun.
♪ Let's go to the mall
♪ let's go<br/>to the mall ♪
♪ Today
So, just to be clear,
You wanted everybody<br/>to go to the mall today?
Wow, we're going<br/>to watch this a lot.
I can't believe I ever wore<br/>a bedazzled jean jacket.
Hey, just so you know,
16-year-old me would<br/>have been all over you.
You could have been the girlfriend<br/>in canada I told everyone I had.
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry<br/>I pried this out of you.
I probably should<br/>have left it alone.
You know what?
You know me better now.
That feels kind of nice.
All:<br/>Aw...
That's one.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, there's nothing more wonderful<br/>than New York City in the winter
... except the view of New York City
in the winter<br/>through your apartment window.
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily,<br/>Robin and I were all deep
in couple hibernation mode.
Sadly, this left Uncle Barney<br/>out in the cold.
Okay.
All-night rave,
abandoned tire factory<br/>in Newark.
We're on the list. Who's in?
-Nope.<br/>-No.
Private jet.
Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving.<br/>Who's in?
-Nope.<br/>-No, thanks.
One beer.
Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?
Shh...
(whispering):<br/>Lily went sleepy-bye.
It got so bad, Barney
tried to be his own wingman.<br/>Hi.
Have you met me?
Finally, he decided<br/>to bring in reinforcements.
ALL:<br/>No.
Yes. And do you know why?
Hang on to your bedsores,<br/>grandparents from Willy Wonka,
because guess who's
on his way up<br/>to this apartment right now?
My... wait for it...
brother, James. React.
ALL:<br/>Hey!
You have a brother?
Yeah. He's the "awesome-est,"
most best "looking-est,"
greatest guy ever.
He's exactly like Barney.
That's what I just said.
Well, Barney and his brother<br/>aren't exactly alike.
James is gay.
Really?
I never in a million years
would I picture you with a gay brother,<br/>that's awesome.
Yeah. I just wanted you
to have a heads up,<br/>so you don't
act all surprised<br/>when he gets here.
Okay. Here he is.
What up, New York.
Thanks for the heads up.
we did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?
Is he black?
I guess I'm the kind<br/>of person that focuses
on who people are<br/>on the inside
rather than the color<br/>of their skin.
I'm kidding, I just<br/>wanted to see your face.
Yeah, so now the<br/>wedding's back on.
Anyway, James,<br/>how have you been?
Awesome, as per "yoozh."
I just went<br/>skinny-skydiving.
Legendary.
And my laser tag team,
just made it to<br/>regional finals.
"Legendarier."
And by now you've
noticed the suit--<br/>go 'head, touch it.
Handcrafted<br/>by Pietro Dellacamera,
Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor
who upon completing<br/>the very last stitch in this suit
dropped dead,
which is ironic because that is how<br/>gorgeous look in it. C'mon.
Gimme five.
Is "gimme five" back?<br/>Oh, yeah.
I put it in my<br/>blog this morning.
Guys, "gimme five" is back!
-Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.<br/>-Hey.
-It's so nice to meet you.<br/>-You, too.
So, I have to ask,<br/>there's a story here.
BOTH (snickering):<br/>Please.
The truth is, Barney and James<br/>got a lot of...
different explanations<br/>from their mom over the years.
Well, boys, you look different
because when I was<br/>pregnant with you,
I only ate<br/>vanilla ice cream.
And when I was<br/>pregnant with you,
can you guess what kind<br/>of ice cream I ate?
Coffee?<br/>No, James,
I ate chocolate ice cream.
But I did drink tons of coffee
when I was pregnant<br/>with both of you.
Can't smoke without my coffee.
I don't know, boys, I guess<br/>it's just one of those things.
Stop asking me!
You know what<br/>you two are?
You're little racists!
So what are you guys<br/>gonna do tonight?
I'll tell you<br/>what James is gonna do.
He's gonna do the job<br/>you've been neglecting.
And, as always,<br/>he'll do it
a lot better<br/>than you ever did.
Ted...
James is my wingman now.
Okay.
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,
lucky twice, and...
whose penthouse hot tub<br/>did you end up in?
Ah, public figure,<br/>confidentiality agreement.
But I will say this:
way more back hair than any guy
who can afford laser hair<br/>removal should have.
And then there was the time they..
scored the brother/sister combo.
It was everything we ever dreamed<br/>of when watching
Donnie and Marie.
She was a little bit country.
He was a little bit<br/>way into black guys.
Yeah, Barney and James together<br/>was a lethal combination.
Since there was never<br/>any crossover in targets,
James was always there<br/>for Barney with the assist.
(mimics skidding):<br/>Whoa.
Your scarf...
it is fierce!
Thanks. H &amp; M.
What? I would never know,
'cause it is so hot<br/>that my eyes are melting.
Oh, I can't see.
Hey! You know,<br/>speaking of things
that would look good<br/>wrapped around you,
have you met my straight<br/>brother, Barney?
Oh, he is fab--<br/>don't you go nowhere--
"ulous." Okay?
And Barney always returned<br/>the favor.
Help, I don't think<br/>he's breathing.
Does anyone know<br/>mouth-to-mouth?
Oh, my God, I do!
Okay, great. How<br/>'bout you instead?
Oh, man, I am so<br/>excited that you're here!
It has been forever<br/>since I have been around
anyone even remotely fun.
Uh, yes offense.
You guys are still going out<br/>with us tonight, right?
No.
Jammies.<br/>I don't think so.
Tonight? It's after 9:00, and...
I have warm soup belly.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...
you are young,<br/>attractive people here
in the greatest city on earth.
There are boys and girls
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,<br/>wishing they could be here.
But instead, they are<br/>in someone's basement
drinking bad malt liquor,<br/>debating
whether or not they're going<br/>to spend their Saturday night
in the parking lot<br/>of the feed store
or in some other dude's<br/>basement.
You owe it to them
to rise up and shimmy<br/>your lazy asses
into something hot,<br/>and you go out there
and you live their dream!
Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
Hell, yeah!<br/>Hell, yeah!
-Can I get a "hell, yeah"?<br/>-Hell, yeah!
-Can I get a "woo-woo"?<br/>-Woo-woo!
Go do it for Wyoming!
(excited screams)<br/>Yes!
Testify!
So that night,<br/>Barney got his wish.
We all went out.
Daddy's home!
Yeah.
All right, bro.<br/>What do you like?
Guy in super<br/>tight black T?
Super tight black guy?
Guy who looks like Mr. T?
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me<br/>after two martinis.
Let's focus on you, my man.
I'm feeling lazy.
How about girl with<br/>the chocolatini?
Oh... boom, back tattoo.
Hero and the pig?<br/>Let's ride.
Fo' 'sho.
Damn baby,<br/>nice tramp stamp!
Get off me, you pig!
Hey! Her body art
is not an invitation<br/>to grope her,
it's an expression<br/>of her inner self.
I'm sure, in many ways, she is
the dolphin encircled<br/>by flowers.
What? What?<br/>What? What?
Cool.
-Let me know if he bothers you again.<br/>-Thanks.
You should stay close...
just in case.
Sure. If it'll make<br/>you feel safer.
I'm Barney.
Now, kids, when you're out<br/>at a noisy, crowded bar,
you can always tell<br/>the difference between the singles
and the couples.
You just have to look<br/>for the signs.
Break.<br/>Boiling hot.
Singles stay on their feet<br/>for maneuverability.
Hey!<br/>Hi, how are ya?
BOTH:<br/>Have you met my brother?
Oh, hello.<br/>Have a drink.
Nice to meet ya.
Couples, exhausted by the sheer act<br/>of leaving the house,
are obsessed with finding<br/>a place to sit down.
There are a lot of other<br/>indicators, too.
From choice<br/>of social lubricant...
Woo!<br/>Wow!
...to basic body language.
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell<br/>whether someone has Single Stamina
or Couples Coma.
I wish I would've worn sneakers.
I just got finished running<br/>from some fat, hairy guy
who was periscoping<br/>out of his pleather pants.
Permission<br/>to come aboard denied.
I miss my jammies.
I can't believe I<br/>wore a bra for this.
Bras suck. They're so<br/>confining and unnatural.
Yeah, they're like<br/>a boobie zoo.
Well, why don't you take it off then
and let those puppies breathe?
Oh, please go sweat<br/>on someone else.
Poor guy.
Poor guy?<br/>Poor my boobs.
Well, it takes a lot<br/>of guts to approach
a girl and you<br/>just crushed him.
Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks<br/>all broken up inside.
Whatever, you guys have no idea<br/>what it's like to be on the receiving end.
"Oh, poor me.
I'm a pretty girl and
everybody everywhere<br/>wants to buy me
drinks and have<br/>sex with me."
Waa.
"Oh, poor me. I get<br/>to order yummy, pink drinks
"with chunks of real fruit<br/>that guys secretly like,
but can't order because<br/>they'll be made fun of."
Dude.<br/>They're delicious!
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.
He's too in shape,
we'd spend all night talking about<br/>his body fat content.
Now, if you'll excuse me,<br/>I'm gonna go have
a yummy, pink drink<br/>with fruit in it...
because I can.
You know, that was,<br/>like, the third hot guy
that James<br/>blew off tonight.
Yeah, he's turning<br/>down shots,
he's yawning, he's<br/>whining about his feet.
He's as bad as we are.
He is.
Wait, he's exactly<br/>as bad as we are.
You guys don't think<br/>that James is...
in a relationship?
No. There's no way.<br/>He's Barney's brother.
Look at that.
He's texting!<br/>(all gasping)
TED:<br/>Oh, my God!
He is in a couple.
This is gonna kill Barney.
What's gonna kill me?
What's going on?
B-Barney?
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?
No.
I mean, he's glowing from his<br/>peel, if that's what you mean.
We have reason<br/>to believe that James is,
uh, maybe hiding<br/>something from you.
I-I know you're not gonna<br/>like hearing this, but...
Barney...
your brother is...
(whispering):<br/>monogamous.
That's ridiculous!
Just because<br/>he's a little sleepy,
and he hasn't had sex
with anyone<br/>in a bathroom stall...
Huh.
He hasn't had sex with anyone<br/>in a bathroom stall.
And, Barney...
I hate to be the one
to tell you this,<br/>but... he's texting.
No, he...
No!
That...
is impossible.
Excuse... Ex...
Hey, bro.
Don't change the subject.
Let me see your phone.
Why?
I just want to<br/>see your phone.
Let me see your phone.
No, it's just a phone.<br/>It's just a phone!
And it's got Internet access,<br/>and it's got a camera on it,
and you can surf the Web<br/>and do the whole thing.
It's so amazing how far<br/>technology has come.
What kind of phone<br/>do you have?
I got...
Who is this?
And the answer better be:<br/>"I don't remember his name."
That is Tom.
He is my fiancee.
I don't support this.
Gay marriage?
Not gay marriage-- marriage!
(shivers)
How can you do this?
We were raised in the same<br/>house, with the same values!
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.
Come on, it's embarrassing.
Look,
this felt unnatural<br/>to me, too, at first.
But I fell in love.
And Tom and I realized<br/>you can't fight love.
Oh, God.
Is that what<br/>you two do together?
You sit around the house<br/>and talk about love?
I think... (groans)<br/>I'm gonna be sick.
Okay, okay, look,
I need you to wrap your head<br/>around this, okay?
Because it is happening.
And I want you<br/>to be my best man.
What?
No way.
Well, I'm sorry<br/>you feel that way.
I hope you<br/>change your mind.
Two beers, one shot.
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.
(giggling)
Oh, sweetie!<br/>Did you make that for me?
Yes.
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?
Okay, I didn't have<br/>high hopes for that one.
Okay, here's my thing.
If gay guys<br/>start getting married,
then suddenly the whole world's<br/>gonna be doing it.
That's how it works.
They start something,<br/>then six months later,
everyone follows.
Like now everyone<br/>gets manicures.
I don't get manicures.
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.
(gasps):<br/>You get your chest waxed?
You know what I mean!
Gay marriage is going to cause
single life, as we know it,<br/>to die out.
Think of how the American family<br/>will be strengthened.
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up<br/>and be a man about this.
No.
It's always been<br/>me and him together,
being awesome, while the rest<br/>of you walked two-by-two
onto your ark<br/>of sexless boredom.
Just because<br/>James is getting married
doesn't mean things<br/>are going to change.
Yeah.
Like things haven't changed<br/>with you people.
Look, my sister married<br/>a guy I didn't like.
Sandals and socks--<br/>come on, buddy.
But I took her out,<br/>we celebrated.
It was the right<br/>thing to do.
You got to support him.
You're right, Ted.
This is a cause for celebration.
We need to take him out<br/>and celebrate the commitment
he and Tom are about to make.
(dance music playing)
Yeah.
This is where we're<br/>celebrating the commitment
that Tom and I<br/>are about to make?
What? Yeah!
See, that cage represents<br/>your commitment.
(giggling)
Oh, my God.
Freedom has never tasted<br/>so delicious.
Hey.
You work out?
I do.
And thank you for noticing.
You're obviously
in very good shape yourself.
Well, I try.
So you want to dance?
You know what? I'm very flattered,<br/>and objectively,
you're a very attractive man,<br/>but this is actually my ???
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw<br/>your drink and I...
No, no,<br/>this isn't my drink.
This is hers.
No, it isn't.
Whatever.
How 'bout you?
Oh, I'm straight, too.
But I thank you<br/>for your time,
and I appreciate<br/>your interest in my body.
You see that?
Being hit on doesn't<br/>have to be terrible.
I feel flattered, and everyone<br/>left with their dignity.
(giggling)
Hey, I really<br/>like your sweater.
Wow.
You actually do, don't you?
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.
My name's Gay Ken,<br/>what do you think?
I love this place!
Let's dance!<br/>And not be groped!
Whoo! Thank you.
Damn.
Thank you!
We're hot totally.
(James laughing)
And then Tom says<br/>to the dealer
that the handmade Georgian clock<br/>has a chip on the corner.
Blam, we get<br/>that puppy half price.
What up?!
Bam!<br/>(laughing)
Sounds like you really rocked<br/>that arts and crafts fair.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Hey, oh, my God.
Thisis so liberating, being<br/>able to talk about this to you.
I cannot wait<br/>for you to meet Tom.
And I cannot wait for you<br/>to meet my good friend...
this guy.
Excuse me, do you know anyone<br/>who would like to buy
my incredibly muscular, fun,<br/>large-handed brother a drink?
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus<br/>on you, Barnaby.
Okay.<br/>(imitating radar beeping)
All right.
I spy a group of women who have<br/>let their defenses down
because they are<br/>in a gay club.
You see that chick<br/>right there?
She looks like<br/>she'd fall for
sports agent<br/>and football player.
Okay, I'm in.
Which one am I?
(laughing)
Please.
He's very shy,
loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants<br/>after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!
I just never thought I'd<br/>see Barney so vulnerable.
Well, I guess no one<br/>wants to feel like
they're going through<br/>the world alone.
Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!
Okay, we're actually<br/>right in the middle
of something<br/>right now, so...
Ooh, I know what I want to be<br/>in the middle of. Thoughts?
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,<br/>enjoy some techno
and good conversation<br/>without being bothered?
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying<br/>the attentions of men?
That's like the eighth guy<br/>who's hit on us in ten minutes.
It's like, hello,<br/>my eyes are up here.
And it's never the hot ones.
It's always the losers.<br/>Bums me out!
Looks like the boys<br/>learned their lesson.
Do you totally miss<br/>being hit on?
Oh, totally.<br/>Let's go find a sports bar.
James, James, since you like<br/>arts and crafts,
look at what<br/>Charles here made
with cherry stems.
He did it with his tongue.
Yeah.
Barney.
So, Charles,
why don't you put your number<br/>in my brother's phone,
and once he's in<br/>a funner mood...
Barney, Barney, I<br/>don't want his number.
I don't want anyone's<br/>number, okay?
I'm getting married.
Wow.
Best of luck to you both.
Thank you.
My number's in here.
I'm very discreet.
Okay, okay,<br/>excuse me.
Barney, family talk.
Okay, dude, you have<br/>got to stop this, okay?
I know that my getting married is<br/>threatening to your way of life...
Oh, so now it's<br/>my way of life?
I thought it was<br/>our way of life.
You've completely<br/>turned your back on it.
Look at you,<br/>not even suited up.
Do you remember why<br/>we suit up, James?
To get laid.
To show people<br/>that we are different
from the millions of T-shirt<br/>and jeans lemmings out there.
The suit shows
that we are a force<br/>to be reckoned with,
a two-person army<br/>that plays by its own rules.
But you've taken off<br/>the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,<br/>and you've abandoned me.
Well, I'm not gonna<br/>let you do that.
It's not too late to back out<br/>of this stupid marriage thing!
You don't have to do this, bro!
-Yes, I do.<br/>- Why?!
Because Tom and I are<br/>gonna have a baby.
What? There's gonna be a baby?
Yes.
We're adopting.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?
For the rest of your life.
(laughing)
And that's how Barney<br/>became Uncle Barney.
A year later,<br/>at James's wedding,
Barney could not<br/>have been more proud.
To James and Tom.
May you have a long<br/>and happy life together.
And may I always have the skin<br/>and libido of a much younger man.
-Cheers.<br/>-Cheers.
Nice one.
Thanks. I decided to leave out<br/>the hetero college phase.
No one wants to hear about that.
It was perfect.
You even made<br/>Tom's dad cry.
Might have been doing that<br/>because he's a Republican.
(chuckles)
Whoa.
It's 9:00.
We should be<br/>getting back.
You guys want<br/>to split a cab?
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna<br/>stay a little bit longer.
Yeah, me, too. I'm<br/>not tired at all.
All right, well,<br/>it's getting late.
Got to get<br/>the wife home.
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.
See ya.
* I won't tell *
* What you told *
* I won't share... *
May I?<br/>Yeah.
(chuckles)
* I will grow old *
* No one will know... *
Hey, buddy.
Your parents are married.
Now, listen,
Just because you're being<br/>raised by married people
doesn't mean you have to choose<br/>that lifestyle.
High-five.
Luckily, you got me.
In 20 and a half years,<br/>you'll be 21,
and I will be...
Well, I haven't decided<br/>how old I'll be yet.
But we are gonna
bro out, uncle and nephew style.
Stick with me, kid.
I am gonna teach<br/>you how to live.
Great suit, by the way.
(mock straining)
Who is the cutest?
See Robin?
Tom likes big breast,<br/>and I intended great it
and now it's laid and out
(sobbing):<br/>Why?
Rosa, why always be attracted<br/>to the unavailable ones?
Why not accept the fact<br/>that you're a beautiful woman
who is worthy of love?
Are you brave enough<br/>to hear that?
You...<br/>Hmm.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted:<br/>Kids, as you know,
Christmas is a time<br/>you spend with your family.
So in December of 2006,<br/>I had three options.
Spend it with my mom<br/>and her new boyfriend clint,
Spend it with my dad and his<br/>new girlfriend micro-brewing,
Or head down to staten island<br/>to spend it
With my super religious cousin<br/>stacy and her family.
So I opted for none of the above
And decided<br/>to spend christmas 2006
In manhattan...
Celebrating<br/>with my other family.
Okay, I have one last paper<br/>due at 5:00 p.M. Today,
So until then, I will be<br/>at the law library at school,
But I'm not to be disturbed<br/>for any reason.
Dude, open your eyes.
You're going to hurt yourself.
No, no.
Christmas eve winter wonderland<br/>is my reward
For finishing my paper.
Oh.
Baby, do I smell your<br/>sinfully cinnamon cookies?
Yes.
Damn me and my<br/>heightened other senses.
Must be strong.
Okay, I'll be<br/>back here at 5:00.
Save me at least 20 cookies
And do not clean the bowl.
Is that a reindeer?
I don't want to know!
Hey, look.
Our old answering machine.<br/>Oh, yeah.
After you left, we,<br/>uh, we unplugged it
Because it reminded marshall
Of how you used to, you<br/>know, leave messages.
But hey,
You guys are back together.
I say we're plugging it back in.
(grunts)
It's good to have you back.
Oh, hey, look, there's<br/>still some messages on here.
Mr. Mosby: Hey ted, it's<br/>dad calling to check in.
I'm going fishing this weekend<br/>with my friend clint,
So if I don't hear from you<br/>beforehand,
I'll talk to you next week.
Yes, same clint.
Are you lying on the couch<br/>right now moping about lily?
You are, aren't you?<br/>Oh...
Well, stop it.
She's not worth it.
You gotta get over that grinch.
But I didn't say "grinch."
I said a bad word.
A very, very bad word.
Oh, fudge.
But I didn't say fudge.
I'm...
A what?
I...
That was barney,<br/>that was barney.
That was you, ted.<br/>That was marshall.
Marshall left a message<br/>for marshall?
You know, it may have been<br/>me, but it was so long ago.
Man, that machine, it<br/>really garbles your voice.
You know, it almost<br/>made it sound like I said...
Why would you call me that?
It was a fair question.
Marshall's breakup with lily<br/>had sent him
Into a deep depression
And nothing could get him out of it.<br/>(moans)
Until one day...
She was perfect.
I lost the perfect woman.
I should have knocked her up<br/>when I had the chance.
Okay.
That's it.
You're never going<br/>to get over her
Until you stop putting her<br/>on a pedestal.
So no more ice cream<br/>until you tell me
One thing that's wrong<br/>with lily.
There's only one of her?
Okay.
She called off your wedding<br/>and dumped you
To be a painter<br/>in san francisco.
What do you call that?
Fiercely independent?<br/>Uh-uh.
Brave?
I guess it was a little selfish.
There you go.
And in almost no time,
That spark turned<br/>into a roaring fire.
Yeah. No, you're right.<br/>Lily would laugh at anything.
She'd give it up for a bad pun.
I'm telling you,<br/>she's a laugh slut.
Remember that time<br/>we heard her laughing
And we thought she was<br/>watching weekend at bernie's,
But it turned out she was<br/>watching weekend at bernie's 2?
And her art?
"I'm lily, I'm an artist."
She doesn't even own a beret.
Yeah, and if she's<br/>such a great "artist,"
Why does she suck at pictionary?
Who draws a ninja star<br/>like a star of david?
Come on, come on. Right, right?<br/>Yeah!
Another round!
(laughing):<br/>Yeah!
I was trying to help him.
I'm his best friend.
That's the best friend's job.
The best friend's job is<br/>to call me that word?
Yeah.
Oh, ted.
Oh, teddy boy.
Why is this such a big deal?
It's just a word.
We use lots of words, every day.
It shouldn't be any different<br/>than any other word.
Then why don't you say it now?
Grinch.
You timed that didn't you?
Perfectly.
Well, at least you apologized.
You apologized, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
"I'm sorry" were the first<br/>words out of my mouth.
I'm sorry, but I am<br/>not apologizing.
I was just trying to put<br/>the guy back together.
You smashed him to pieces.
Are you seriously not going to<br/>apologize for leaving that...?
No!<br/>Why not?
Because, lily, this summer,
You were kind of a grinch.
Both:<br/>Oooh.
Oh, you'll be sorry, ted mosby.
Ted vivian mosby!
That's not my middle name.
You kiss your mother<br/>with that mouth?
Like you've never<br/>said that word.
I don't kiss your mother<br/>with my mouth.
Yet.
(sneezes)
Are you sick?
Is it sick to find maturity
And experience sexy?
No, I meant
Do you have a cold?
I'm fine.
(blowing nose)
I'm fine.
My nose is just<br/>overflowing with awesome
And I had to get some of it out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, the<br/>holidays are a time when people
Are lonely and desperate.
It's the most wonderful<br/>time of the year.
I should go apologize.
It's christmas eve.
Yeah. I mean, slamming<br/>doors and screaming curses?
If I wanted that, I would have<br/>gone home for the holidays.
I don't see any<br/>mistletoe, but...
(sneezes)
Oh! Oh, god!
Uh... "bless you" would<br/>have been nice.
You're sick.<br/>I'm not sick.
You're sick.
You know what? I am sick.
Sick of you telling me I'm sick.
What up? (coughing)
Ahh... Three flights of stairs,<br/>not a drop spilled.
Hey, buddy.
You sure this is gonna work?
Yeah, this is our thing.
In college, whenever<br/>I wanted to make up
With her, I'd buy her<br/>a beer. Cute, right?
Totally.<br/>Plus free mug.
Come on.
Usually that<br/>would've done the trick,
But it turned out<br/>this was a problem
Not even alcohol could solve.
Actually the beer<br/>helped a little.
She took the decorations.
She took the decorations!
What a grinch!
That time I did say "grinch."
All right.
I guess I have<br/>to call her, right?
Lily's cell phone.
She'll listen to<br/>reason... right?
Oh, hey, billy.
Actually, funny thing...<br/>The voice dial got you.
I was trying to call...
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, the holidays are a rough<br/>time for everyone, billy.
Okay, yeah,<br/>dinner next Wednesday.
Okay.
Damn voice dial.
Barney!
What the hell are you doing?!
Get in here, it's<br/>freezing outside.
Are you insane?
Hey, blame lily and her
Oppressive "no cigars<br/>in the apartment rule."
God, it's like marshall's<br/>marrying the taliban.
(sneezes)
High five.
Eww. No.
You have to go home<br/>and get to bed.
Oh, robin, my simple friend<br/>from the untamed north,
Let me tell you
About a little thing I like<br/>to call mind over body.
You see,
Whenever I start feeling sick,
I just stop being sick<br/>and be awesome instead.
True story.
Yeah, in two minutes,
I'm going to pound a sixer<br/>of red bull, hop in a cab,
Play a couple of hours<br/>of laser tag,
Maybe get a spray-on tan.
It's gonna be legen...
Wait for it...
(snoring softly)
Lily!
Merry christmas, assface.
Um, lily?
Where are the christmas<br/>decorations?
At my apartment.
So we can celebrate<br/>christmas together... please?
Ted, do you know what I would do
If one of my kindergartners<br/>used that kind of language?
I would be on the phone<br/>with their parents.
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.
Exactly.
You know what that word means.
You know that<br/>calling people names
Is mean and hurtful... Assface.
Lily, if you don't
Bring that stuff back<br/>right now, we...
She hung up.
She's just mad.<br/>She'll cool down.
Mm-hmm.<br/>(phone ringing)
Aha.
Lily...
Don't forget to take the cookies
Out of the oven... Assface!
Damn it!
I could be in<br/>cleveland right now
Making peppermint lager<br/>with my dad.
Where are you going?
Marshall gets home<br/>in three hours.
He's gonna show up...<br/>No lily, no winter wonderland.
I gotta get up to the bronx.
Dary.
(phone ringing)
Hey, dude,<br/>how's the paper going?
Screw the paper,<br/>how's the winter wonderland?
Is it magical?
Oh... So magical.
When you walk<br/>through the door, does it feel
Like you've been slapped<br/>in the face by christmas?
Sure does.
Look, I gotta go.
Come on, man, describe it!
Tell me about the decorations.
Is rudolph there?
He is, isn't he?
Hi, rudolph!
Ah, yeah, but, you know...
Decorations, is that really<br/>what christmas is about?
Hell, yeah!<br/>What else would it be about?
Uh, try the birth of christ.
You know, christmas...<br/>Christ mas,
Which means "more christ"<br/>to our spanish friends.
Yeah, well, all I know<br/>is walking through that door
And seeing the winter wonderland<br/>and seeing lily
And all you guys, just...
I can't wait.
Right. I gotta go.
Right. Okay. Oh, wait.
Ted, ted, ted, ted.<br/>One more thing.
How about the cookies?<br/>Are they delicious?
(shrieking)
You know, honestly, they taste<br/>a little store-bought.
Oh! I got another call.
Well, tell lily I love her.
Right.
Hello?
Ted evelyn mosby!
Oh. Uh, hey, mom.
I just got the most<br/>disturbing call from lily.
How could you use<br/>such a horrible word?
Oh, god, she called you?
Are you acting out<br/>because of the divorce?
Is-is this all about clint?
No, mom, why<br/>would it be about clint?
Hey, buddy, it's clint.
How you doing, champ?
Hey, clint. Listen, um,
Hey, hey, no,<br/>I don't really have time to...
No, no. Ted, ted.
You don't know this yet,
But you and I are going<br/>to be great friends.
Now,
The native americans<br/>have this ritual...
(coughing)
(sighs)
This is a low moment<br/>for the barnacle.
I should be off playing<br/>laser tag right now,
But instead...
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.
You just look like<br/>a regular guy.
Exactly.
I'm a ted.
I'm wearing<br/>elastic-waist fleece pants.
And isn't it more comfy?
Yes.
Come on, you need eat something.
Too weak...
To hold... Bowl.
Fine, I'll feed you.
Mmm.
Ouchie in my mouth!
I don't want it.<br/>I want ice cream.
No, you're not having ice cream
For dinner<br/>just 'cause you're sick.
But my throat hurts.<br/>No.
I hate you!
Oh.<br/>Don't leave me.
(knock at door)
Who is it?
Pizza delivery.
Whoa.
Hey, you tricked me.
You really thought<br/>I was the pizza delivery guy?
No, I knew it was you.
I just thought you'd<br/>at least bring a pizza.
Yeah, well, I brought a beer,
But I gave it to a homeless guy.
All right, he took it from me.
Now, will you please come home?
No, I'm not spending<br/>christmas with you.
Okay, I'm sorry for calling you<br/>a... That word,
Over the summer,
And for saying it again today.
And for thinking it a lot<br/>on the subway ride over.
I had no right to say that.
It was hurtful
And immature and I'm sorry.
Oh, shut up.
You think I don't know
Your fake apologies<br/>by now, ted mosby?
Huh?
You're clearly still mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.<br/>Yes, you are.
I am not mad at you, lily.<br/>Now, can we please just...
I've apologized to marshall<br/>and he's forgiven me
And we've moved passed it.<br/>Why can't you?
Because you never<br/>apologized to me.
You leave for three months,<br/>you don't even call.
Come on, lily, we're supposed<br/>to be friends!
Yeah, some friend,<br/>you called me a grinch.
You were a grinch!
How can you...<br/>Grinchy,
Grinch, grinch, grinch<br/>grinch, grinch, grinch.
Happy?
Now, you've pissed off<br/>the big guy upstairs.
Yeah, I'm sure god cares if I...
Big guy upstairs: You use that language<br/>again and I'll turn off your water!
That's my super.<br/>He lives above me.
Great.
Thanks to your filthy mouth,
Now I'm going to have christmas<br/>alone in the dark.
Fine. I don't want<br/>to ruin christmas.
You can have the apartment.
Don't worry<br/>about seeing me there
I'll be in staten island<br/>with my cousin stacy.
Just...
Ow.
Merry christmas.
You're spending christmas eve<br/>with your family?
Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.
Uh, they're fine. They're<br/>just... They're a little weird.
You know they don't believe<br/>in gifts or christmas trees.
And they think santa's<br/>how satan spells his name
When he wants to trick us.
Well, do you want me to go<br/>with you?
Was that a sincere offer?
First tell me your answer.
Stay there. Save yourself.
We'll spend all day<br/>together tomorrow.
Okay.
You mean the whiney bottomless<br/>pit of neediness?
He was bugging me, so I spiked<br/>his echinacea tea with codeine.
You're gonna be a great mom.
Mm-hmm.
Holy crap, the magical<br/>christmas season is upon us.
And thank god we don't pay<br/>for utilities.
Merry christmas!<br/>What's in the box?
Only the best christmas present<br/>for the best girl ever.
It took me all day<br/>to track it down.
I thought you were<br/>writing a paper.
Ah, naw, I blew that off.
I'll get an extension.<br/>School's not important.
What is that pitter<br/>patter on the roof?
Could it be the sound of<br/>an awesome christmas story
About to come down the chimney?
Why, yes, it is.
'Twas the day before<br/>christmas...
It was supposed to arrive,<br/>like, five days ago,
But then it got lost<br/>and rerouted.
I checked two other branches,
Finally they told me<br/>it was here.
Yeah, all I needed to know was<br/>the tracking number.
Looks like it's headed out
To our regional branch<br/>in poughkeepsie.
What?
No, no, no, no,<br/>I need that package today.
Listen, the truck already<br/>left five minutes ago,
So unless you want to run<br/>after it...
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, please, stop.
Stop the truck.
(panting):<br/>I need a package on your truck.
Can I please take a look<br/>in back?
Sure. But I gotta keep<br/>driving my route.
I'm running behind.
(screeching)
Whoa.
Wpd driver:<br/>My bad.
I'm okay.
Hey, man,
Thanks for helping me make<br/>my fiancée's christmas.
No problem.
Too bad I can't deliver<br/>all these packages
By the end of the day.
Wait, so some people aren't<br/>going to get their gifts
In time for christmas?
Sadly, no.
♪ They call me back door santa
♪ I make my runs<br/>about the break of day ♪
♪ They call me back door santa
♪ I make my runs<br/>about the break of day ♪
♪ Oh, ho, ho
♪ I make all the little<br/>girls happy... ♪
We delivered every single<br/>package on that truck.
Oh.
But I still have one package<br/>left to give.
Mmm.
Yeah, I did.
(giggles)
Merry christmas.
Open it, baby.<br/>Okay.
Ah.
Oh, my god.
An easy bake oven!
I've wanted one of these ever<br/>since I was a little girl.
In this exact model.
I never told you that.<br/>How did you know?
It's our first christmas<br/>since we got back together.
I want to get her something<br/>really special.
So I'm getting her a jukebox.
Wow, that's a great gift.
Not really. It's this big<br/>and it dispenses gum.
Oh, man, I know something<br/>you could get her
That would blow her mind.
Ready?
Eight years ago...
When I was a kid, all I wanted<br/>was an easy bake oven.
I begged and I begged,<br/>but all I got
Was a stupid lego set
Because my feminist mom didn't<br/>want me conforming
To traditional gender roles.
Easy bake oven... that's what<br/>I'm going to call my van.
Dude...
How was the concert?
I couldn't find the outside.
(laughing)
I can't believe ted remembered<br/>after all these years.
Yeah, and after all that weed.
Where is he anyway?
Staten island.
Why?
All right, don't tell your mom,
But I got you guys<br/>some presents.
Like the the gift of god's love?
No, dude, real presents.
Uncle ted got us presents!
That's okay, ted, we'll<br/>just give them to charity.
Yay!
Uh, not you, charity.
I meant the less fortunate.
Ted, how would you like<br/>to say grace tonight?
Uh, you know what,<br/>why don't you say it.
I really wouldn't know<br/>what to say.
Why don't you recite your<br/>favorite passage of scripture.
That's a great idea, charity.
But, really, I don't know.
I mean how do you choose<br/>your favorite passage?
It's the bible;
There's so many...<br/>Great ones...
(doorbell ringing) ooh, I'll get it.<br/>Charity, I'm tapping you in.
Dear, father, thank you<br/>for this day,
And thank you for bringing<br/>this family together.
Amen.
Who is it, ted?
Uh, it's...<br/>It's just, um, carolers.
♪ Silent night
All:<br/>♪ holy night...
I came here to apologize.
I'm so sorry, ted.
I accept. Give me the beer.
Mmm...
Mm, oh, it is so good<br/>to see you guys.
Are you coming home?
Totally.
But first, lily, I owe<br/>you an apology.
Oh, for the love of god, are you<br/>as sick of apologies as I am? Yes!
Can we just skip the apology and<br/>go straight to the forgiving? Yes.
And I promise, I will never ever<br/>call you a... You know, again.
That's okay.
I was kind of a grinch.
What's a grinch?
Nothing. It's something<br/>you shouldn't say.
Mom, what's a grinch?
Grinch, grinch, grinch...
(kids chanting):<br/>Grinch, grinch, grinch...
Grinch, grinch, grinch...
Grinch, grinch, grinch...
Grinch, grinch...<br/>Merry christmas, everybody.
Run, run.
Merry christmas, marshall.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, you remember<br/>my first date with robin.
I think I'm in love with you.
What?!
Well, here's the thing,
Normal people, you know,<br/>people who aren't your dad,
Usually take longer<br/>to say "I love you."
Robin went through<br/>the usual stages.
Spider!
Spider! I left something<br/>in the hallway.
Where?<br/>Right there.
(sighs) got it.
First there's the moment<br/>when you think you think it.
Whoa, still alive.<br/>(yells)
There's the moment<br/>you think you know it.
Oh, you don't want to<br/>kiss me, you'll get sick.
Totally worth it.
There's the moment<br/>where you know you know it,
But you can't yet say it.
All right, it's getting<br/>to be that time.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?
Good night.
Good night.
Wait. Ted?
Yeah?
Good night.
Well, great, I'll see you then.
Bye, sweetie.
My sister katie is coming<br/>to visit next weekend.
She gets in on Thursday.
That's awesome. You know<br/>what I'm going to do?
I'm going to take<br/>off work Friday.
We're gonna take her to<br/>the empire state building.
Really? You'd do that?
Of course. Everyone should see<br/>the empire state building.
And then there's the moment<br/>when you know you know it,
And you can't keep it in<br/>any longer.
Ted.<br/>Yeah?
Falafel.
Falafel?
Falafel.
Instead of telling ted<br/>you love him,
You said "falafel"?
I totally choked.
I just don't get it.
Why can't you tell<br/>ted you love him?
Oh, come on, this<br/>is a big deal for me.
Oh, god, you'd think you never<br/>said it to a guy before.
No.
Okay, well, I don't<br/>usually get this far
In the relationship.
I usually take<br/>the three-week exit.
Don't tell me you're<br/>actually buying into
Barney's freeway theory.
Watch your steps when you get<br/>up, kids, 'cause I am about
To drop some knowledge.
Relationships are like<br/>a freeway.
Wait a minute, a month ago<br/>you told me relationships
Are like a traveling circus.
No, this is new.<br/>This trumps that.
Freeways have exits.
So do relationships.
The first exit, my personal<br/>favorite, is six hours in.
You meet, you talk,<br/>you have sex,
You exit when<br/>she's in the shower.
So every girl you have sex with
Feels the immediate<br/>need to shower?
Actually, yeah, I get that.
The next exits are four days,<br/>three weeks, seven months...
That's when you guys are gonna<br/>break up, mark your calendars.
Hey!<br/>What?
Then a year and a half,<br/>18 years,
And the last exit... death.
Which, if you've been with the<br/>same woman for your entire life,
It's like, "are we there yet?"
So I've never been on the<br/>freeway this long before.
I mean, usually by now,<br/>I find out the guy
Has some weird personality thing
That makes me want<br/>to take the next exit.
Yeah, been there.<br/>I once dated a guy
Who could only<br/>go to the bathroom
When classical music<br/>was playing.
Okay, it was marshall.
It's just things are<br/>going so well with ted.
I just don't want<br/>to complicate it.
Relax, it'll happen<br/>when it happens.
Which is also the advice<br/>I gave marshall
To get him over<br/>the classical music thing.
Oh, here comes katie.
Aw, your sister's so cute. Yeah.
This reminds me of<br/>when I used to see her
Coming up the driveway<br/>from school,
With her little pigtails<br/>and her hello kitty backpack.
Well, hello, kitty.<br/>Oh, no.
No. No. No.
Hey, robin.
Hey.<br/>How are you?
Oh, good. Good.
So, who is this...<br/>Tongue person?
Oh, robin,
This is my boyfriend kyle.
Looks like hotness<br/>runs in the family.
Oh, you said that.
Great.
So how long have<br/>you two been...?
He's actually coming to visit<br/>family in new york, too.
Isn't that great?
My cousin.
He's 23, kind of a wad,
But he buys me beer, so...
(chuckles nervously)<br/>that's cool.
This is my friend lily.
Hot.
You say things!
Well, come on, let's get you
Back to my place,<br/>we'll get you settled.
Um, actually, I'm going<br/>to stay with kyle tonight.
Uh, no, you're not.
Oh, come on.
It's kind of a special night.
If you know what I mean.
What?
Oh. Oh...
(sighs)
I can't believe my baby sister
Is planning<br/>to lose her virginity
To a douche with a faux-hawk.
You guys have to help me<br/>talk her out of it.
Speech to talk a girl<br/>out of having sex.
Yeah, I don't have any of those.
Discouraging premarital sex<br/>is against my religion.
Please? I'm her older sister.<br/>I'm supposed to teach her
How to make good<br/>and responsible decisions.
It's 2:00 and you've already<br/>had three scotch and sodas.
That's why I need your help.
Robin convinced katie to stay<br/>with her that first night.
And the next day,
I took everybody<br/>to the empire state building.
You guys are lucky you came here<br/>with an architect.
Empire state building<br/>fun fact number one:
When construction began on March<br/>17, 1930, the framework rose
At a rate of four and a half<br/>stories per week.
Four and a half stories<br/>per week.
Four and a half stories<br/>per week.
(murmuring) wow. There it is.
There it is.<br/>Come on.
These are fun facts, guys,<br/>let's have fun with them.
You know, katie, I have wanted
To come to the empire state<br/>building for so long,
But I waited to come here<br/>with someone special.
Oh, here we go.
Marshall and I have never been
To the empire state<br/>building, either.
I waited to do something<br/>so important
With my fiancé.
Speaking of waiting,
I signed an abstinence<br/>pledge in high school.
It's totally cool to wait.
And stay away from drugs...<br/>Other than pot.
You told them?
Oh, okay, yes, I told them.
But only because I think<br/>you should hear it
From other grownups, too.
Everyone thinks<br/>you should wait, right, guys?
Totally. You should wait.<br/>Sex is fun.
See?
You are such a hypocrite.
You were only 16<br/>when you lost yours.
How do you know that?<br/>You left your diary
In your old room<br/>slash my new room.
I'll pay you $10,000<br/>for that diary.
Look, I've been dating kyle<br/>for two months now.
It's like forever.
I mean, we've already<br/>done everything else.
I mean, we've even...
Oh. La, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la,<br/>la, la, la, la, la, la.
Even kyle gets to do that.
You have no right<br/>to tell me not to do it.
But kyle?<br/>Why can't you just wait?
Because if you wait, you can get
A nice guy, like ted.
Robin, this is happening.
Look, I already put it up<br/>on my myspace page.
I need a clove.
You smoke now, too?
Oh, remember cloves?
No!<br/>No "aw, remember cloves?"
This can't happen.
She's my
She should be watching<br/>the little mermaid
And drinking yoohoo,<br/>and not having sex.
Come on, you were only<br/>16 when you had sex.
I was 17.
We were 18.
Barney was probably 12.
(chuckles) good one, ted.
I was, uh, six... Fourt...
How old were you again?
17.
Dude, me, too.
Barney, you okay?
Yeah, of course.
What, you don't believe me?
It was at camp, so I'm...<br/>What camp?
This place in the catskills.<br/>Look it up.
I was there teaching<br/>for the summer, so...
What did you teach?
Uh, dance.
Dance?
Yeah, ted, dance.<br/>Maybe you've heard of it.
It was just a simple summer job,
But it turned into so much more.
Barney:<br/>Her name was frances houseman,
But everyone called her baby.
♪ Sylvia
♪ yes, mickey?
♪ How you call your loverboy?
♪ Come here, loverboy
♪ and if he doesn't answer
♪ oh, loverboy
♪ and if he still doesn't<br/>answer? ♪
♪ I simply say, baby...
♪ oh, baby
♪ my sweet baby
That's dirty dancing.
Ted:<br/>It was on last night.
No, it was two nights ago.
"She's like the wind"
Has been stuck in my brain<br/>for about 40 hours.
I just got it out.<br/>Now it's back in.
Damn you, swayze!
Do you remember our first time?
Yeah.
It was back in college.
Oh, wait, wait.<br/>Look...
I really want to do this, but...
We should make it<br/>special, you know?
Do this right.
Okay.
You're right.
Maybe we could go to the beach
And get a house for the weekend.
Yeah, new year's eve.
Okay.
Oh, and we'll light candles
And maybe put on<br/>some classical music.
That's not a good idea.
Why not?
Long story.
But maybe we could<br/>put on some al green
And take a bubble bath together.
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.
Oh, I love you, marshall.
I'm so glad we're waiting.
Oops.
Oh, that's adorable.
Yeah, tell her<br/>what happened next.
That was amazing.
Yeah.
Want to do it again?
Please don't.
We said we were sorry.
Yeah, well, then<br/>why'd you do it again?
You know what,<br/>I loaned you my walkman.
The point is
No matter what,<br/>it's never gonna be
As perfect as you want it to be.
Well, mine was terrible.
Wait, I've never<br/>heard your story.
Well, as you know, I was 16.
And it was<br/>with my boyfriend, brian.
Ready?
Yeah.
Wow.
This feels so right.
Oh, I know.
Oh, robin.
Oh, brian.
Yeah, I'm gay.
I'm so sorry.
Eh, I should've known.
There were signs.
(door opens) oh, my god!
My mom's home.<br/>Quick!
Get under my bed.<br/>What?!
Oh, my god!
You only get one shot<br/>at losing your virginity.
And even though I just barely<br/>had sex, it counts.
What do you mean just barely?
Well, he didn't dive<br/>all the way into the pool,
But he... Splashed around<br/>in the shallow end.
Then you didn't lose<br/>your virginity to him.
"Just barely" doesn't count.
Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.<br/>Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.
It doesn't count.<br/>End of story.
Ooh, why, lily aldrin,<br/>you saucy little harlot.
Could it be that before marshall
Took a swim,<br/>someone else tested the water?
(chuckles): No. Nobody else<br/>tested the water, right?
Scooter?
Who's scooter?
My high school boyfriend,
Who I did not have sex with.
I can't believe this.
We're marshall and lily...<br/>When people see us, they say,
"oh, look at them, they've<br/>only had sex with each other."
No, marshall, they say,
(sadly):<br/>"oh, look at them,
They've only had sex<br/>with each other."
Marshall:<br/>But now
That's not true anymore...<br/>Now you've had sex
With twice as many<br/>people as I have.
I knew that you were<br/>too good at it.
Know what?<br/>I don't want to see
The stupid<br/>empire state building anymore.
It's not stupid.
I'm going to see kyle.
Katie, please.
You only get<br/>to lose your virginity once.
You should only be having sex<br/>with someone who's special.
Oh, please... you've had sex<br/>with, like, a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.
(loudly):<br/>It's not a hundred guys.
I'm sure you were madly<br/>in love with all of them.
I had different levels<br/>of feeling for each of the...
Very reasonable number of guys.
Really.
Well, do you love ted?
Do you love ted?
I, um...<br/>Okay, empire state building
Fun fact number 22:
The empire state building<br/>has tons of places
Where people can have<br/>private conversations.
You're off the hook, okay?<br/>Just let me explain.
You don't have to<br/>explain anything.
You don't have to<br/>say it... it's fine.
Okay, but if relationships<br/>are like a freeway,
Then saying... "hm hm hm"
Is like... Getting<br/>into the carpool lane.
And I don't want<br/>to take an exit, but...
At the same time,
I'm not ready to get<br/>into the carpool lane.
Because what's<br/>in the carpool lane?
Oh, it's a big diamond,<br/>and I'm just not ready to get...
Okay, robin, robin, stop.
It's no big deal...<br/>You don't have to say it.
It's just, it's a big thing<br/>to say to someone,
And I don't want<br/>to say it too soon.
What, you mean like I did?
No. I didn't...
Yeah, like you did.
I mean, you have to admit it,<br/>ted, it was a little weird.
Weird... Or courageous?
Pretty sure weird.<br/>Okay.
I mean, who gives it up<br/>on the first date?
Well, come on, it shows I'm<br/>brave and bold, like a knight.
No, it shows that you're<br/>an I-love-you slut.
Well, then you're an<br/>I-love-you prude.
You know what?<br/>I take mine back.
You... What? I take<br/>my "I love you" back.
You can't take it back. Nah. Just did.<br/>Got it right here.
But, you know, I'm such a slut,
I'm just gonna give it away
Hey, you, sir.<br/>I love you.
(voice breaks):<br/>Thank you, man.
I was going up there to jump.
Lily: Marshall, why is<br/>this such a big deal?
Why is this such a big deal?
Oh, uh, sorry,<br/>christopher columbus,
Guess who actually<br/>discovered the new world.
Some dude named scooter.
Neil armstrong,<br/>it actually goes like this:
"one small step for man,<br/>one giant leap for scooter."
Whoa, hey, adam,
Guess who got with eve before you did...<br/>Okay, marshall,
It's a big deal because<br/>it rewrites our history.
No, it doesn't.
Look, have you been<br/>to the empire state building?
No. You've only been<br/>in the lobby.
People don't buy tickets<br/>to get in the lobby.
They buy tickets<br/>to get to the top.
Scooter only
Got in the lobby,
And the lobby doesn't count.
Really. Excuse me, sir,<br/>uh, can you tell me
How to get to the empire<br/>state building?
Um, we're in it right now.
Thank you, sir.
You're a very wise<br/>and brilliant man.
You're right.
Why would I throw that all away?
I'm having the best day!
Katie, I'll admit,
Maybe I'm not in any<br/>place to lecture you
On romantic<br/>relationships, but...
But I just don't want you
To make the same mistakes<br/>that I've made.
(laughs): Oh, believe<br/>me, kyle is not gay.
That's not what I meant.
I just wish you weren't<br/>in such a rush to grow up.
Please don't do this.
Ted: But, kids, later<br/>that night katie did it,
And she got pregnant...
With quintuplets...
And she lived out her days<br/>in a trailer park...
Where she died an alcoholic.
So the moral here, kids,
Don't have sex<br/>until you're married.
Maybe even wait<br/>a year or two into marriage.
Dad! Dad! Come on,<br/>what really happened?
All right,
Here's what really happened.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
She didn't do it.
Hey, that's great!<br/>You got through to her.
No, I didn't. You did.
She told me that<br/>you talked to her.
Hey, katie.
Hey.
Got another empire state<br/>building fun fact for me?
(laughs):<br/>No. I wouldn't bore you
With the seven million man-hours<br/>it took to build
This 102-story testament<br/>to human will.
So, you okay?
I don't know what everyone<br/>is freaking out about.
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.
He could've cheated on me
With my lab partner<br/>gretchen gwynn,
But he didn't.
Because he said<br/>he knew I'd find out.
That's very gallant.
Well, I don't know what
Your sister's freaking<br/>out about, either.
I was your age my first time.<br/>Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh,<br/>it was with this girl, molly.
I love you, ted.
Oh, I love you, too, molly.
But I didn't.
That was amazing.
Look, I got to go.
Where are you going?
My cousin got some<br/>firecrackers from mexico.
We're going out to<br/>the woods to light 'em...
It's gonna be awesome.
Well, will you call me?
Yeah. Yeah,<br/>I'll totally call you.
But I didn't.
Molly?
Yeah?
Can I borrow 20 bucks?<br/>I'll totally pay you back.
But I didn't.
And I never saw her again.
I told her I loved her, but...<br/>I just wanted to have sex.
I-I would've said anything<br/>to make that happen, and...
That's exactly what I did.
Oh. Look, I'm not telling you
What to do.
I'm just telling you what<br/>all 17-year-old boys are like.
Even the nice ones.
So I told kyle I<br/>wanted to wait...
(crying):<br/>And he dumped me.
Oh, oh, sweetie,
I'm so sorry.
Aw, honey.
I promise everything<br/>is gonna be okay.
And drink some yoo-hoo?
Only if you put a buttload<br/>of kahlua in it.
Don't tell mom.
Thanks for doing that.
You're welcome.
I knew it meant a lot to you.
But, man, your story,
I mean, it doesn't<br/>even sound like you.
Yeah, well...
I love you, molly.
Oh, I love you, too, ted.
Wow. That was amazing.
Look, I got to go.
Wh-where are you going?
Uh, my cousin got some<br/>firecrackers from mexico.
We're going into the woods<br/>to light them.
It's gonna be awesome.
Will you call me?
Yeah. I'll totally call you.
Oh, ted?
Yeah?
Can I borrow 20 bucks?<br/>I'll totally pay you back.
But she didn't.
Oh, come here.
I love you.
(sighs)
(laughs) I said it.
Feels right.
I love you.<br/>I'm gay.
Oh...<br/>I'm kidding.
I love you, too.
Mmm...<br/>Mmm...
Hey...
You lost your<br/>I-love-you-ginity.
Yeah.
I guess I was just<br/>waiting for the right guy.
Katie ended up having<br/>a great first time in new york.
And the last thing we did<br/>before she left
Was go<br/>to the empire state building.
Wow, I am so glad we're<br/>finally doing this.
What are you talking about?<br/>We were here yesterday.
Yeah, but that<br/>didn't really count.
Oh, crap.
Exactly!
So yesterday doesn't count
As having gone<br/>to the empire state building.
So I lost it to you, marshall.
And I rode that elevator<br/>to the top,
And I saw that view,<br/>and I basked in the awesomeness.
And that's our story.
Yeah. Yeah,<br/>that's our story.
We've only had sex<br/>with each other.
We've only had sex<br/>with each other.
They've only had sex<br/>with each other.
(shudders)
Ooh, okay, in, in we go,<br/>in we go.
Ha-ha-ha!
Okay, empire state building<br/>fun fact number 81:
There are 1,860 steps
From this... Whoa, whoa!
(barney cackles) come on!
So, now you guys can finally say
You've been to the<br/>empire state building.
How have you lived here so long<br/>and never been to the top?
Well, we're usually busy...
Drinking.
Lily:<br/>Speaking of first times,
We never got to hear your<br/>virginity story. Oh, yeah.
That's right, I almost forgot.
Okay. I was 16,
And it was<br/>in a baseball dugout...
I mean, I was in a subway<br/>with a high-priced call girl...
I was accidentally<br/>hacking into norad's computer...
That's war games, and there's<br/>not even a sex scene in it.
All right!
I was 23, and it was<br/>with my mom's 45-year-old
Divorced friend, rhonda.
She called me "barry"<br/>the whole time,
And for two weeks, my comforter<br/>smelled like menthol cigarettes.
You happy?
Hey...
Why don't you
Tell us again about<br/>your first time
At the camp in the catskills.
Baby and her family spent<br/>every summer at kellerman's.
Her dad did not approve<br/>of our love.
Did anyone put baby in a corner?
Oh, god, no.
What can I say, I...
Had... The time of my life.
True story.<br/>Mm.
♪ I had
♪ the time of my life.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Some kids dream<br/>of being astronauts.
Some kids dream<br/>of playing baseball.
When I was a kid,<br/>I had only one dream.
To build a skyscraper.
That's stupid.
There were some obstacles<br/>along the way.
But eventually<br/>my dream came true.
I became an architect.
Morning, everyone!
So, I had an idea<br/>for the atrium.
Ready?
Columns.
That's stupid.
I... I can't believe
You knocked over my model.
Well, it's just... It's not<br/>exactly new is it... columns?
I mean, what's your next<br/>groundbreaking idea... ceilings?
Floors?
Windows?
Ted:<br/>I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?
Well, this jerk was<br/>hammond druthers,
A legend in the architecture<br/>community.
Very big in the '80s.
He was also far and away<br/>the worst boss I ever had.
Then I designed the spokane<br/>national bank building.
And suddenly...
I was his boss.
And he didn't like it.<br/>Stairs?
And to be honest, I wasn't sure<br/>I liked it either.
See, before, when I was just<br/>another employee,
I was happy, carefree.
The guy who hung out<br/>in the break room
Making fun of the boss.
Did you see what<br/>he was wearing today?
It was like his pants were<br/>being held up by his nipples.
(all laugh)
Yeah, and that shirt<br/>with the flowers,
I get hay fever just<br/>looking at it.
(all laugh)
But suddenly<br/>I was a different guy.
(laughter)
Hey, guys.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Um... Nice shirt.
Thanks.
The hours were insane.
I was always working even<br/>when I wasn't at work.
Oh, robin...
I just had a great idea.
Oh, do whatever you want<br/>to me just don't wake me up.
Before, I used to be this guy.
Dude, of course you<br/>should take the day off
For the foo fighters concert.
Just say you're sick.
But now...
(coughing) I was this guy.
Sick, huh?
Unbutton your shirt.
Hmm... "foo fighters."
Get back to work.
But still, the worst part<br/>was druthers.
Well, I was thinking...
Ceilings?
Oops.
Said that already.
Then again, you seem to like<br/>rehashing old ideas.
I'm kidding, of course.
Another hole in one, boss.
(clicks tongue)
Oh, wow, he must be<br/>really good-looking.
Why would you say that?
Well, 'cause only good-looking<br/>people can get away
With saying things like that.
I have found that to be true.
It's a blessing<br/>and a curse really.
Ted, you can't let him<br/>treat you like that.
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
Who's the boss?
Tony.
Angela.<br/>Mona.
Mona?
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well...
It's awkward, I mean,<br/>the guy used to be my boss.
So, I went to talk<br/>to the managing partner.
Fire him.
Well, sir, I was thinking
He could just be put<br/>on a different project.
Fire him.
He's an arrogant, washed-up,
Pain in the ass.
In fact,
Fire everyone on that project.
Druthers, mosby,
The whole lot of them.
Mosby, sir?
I, I... I hear mosby's doing<br/>some great work.
Fine, mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.
Come here.
I like you, crosby.
You mind if I charge my phone?
Knock yourself out.
Well, ted, if you<br/>do fire druthers,
The key is timing.
Remember when I had to<br/>fire my makeup artist?
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,
But there's been some<br/>budget cuts and, um,
We have to let you go.
I mean, after tonight.
I still need my makeup<br/>for the broadcast.
So...
Our thoughts and prayers go out<br/>to the families of the victims.
You know what?<br/>I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna fire druthers<br/>tomorrow.
Oh, my god!<br/>What?
Do you know about this?
No.<br/>What is that?
Only the greatest thing ever.
Wait, wait, wait...<br/>That's not enough buildup.
If they were<br/>to cure cancer tomorrow,
This would still be the greatest<br/>thing to happen all week.
Okay.
Now you're ready<br/>for naked marshall.
Oh, my god.
This is awesome times awesome.
It's awesome squared.
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.<br/>Wait.
If marshall went to all<br/>this trouble to hide it,
He clearly doesn't<br/>want us to find it.
Oh, come on, robin.<br/>No,
I'm saying that he must be<br/>really embarrassed by this.
We are gonna have so much fun.
I know! We're gonna<br/>have so much fun!
Oh, sorry I'm late;<br/>lunch ran a little long.
You wanted to see me, mosby?
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.
Well, excuse me,
For spending the last four hours
Drawing designs<br/>for your building.
This is a cocktail napkin.
Covered in profanity.
Look, hammond,
Um, there's no easy<br/>way to say this,
So...
Why don't we just, um,
Step into your office.
Group:<br/>♪ happy birthday
Oh... (laughing)<br/>♪ to you
♪ happy birthday to you<br/>oh, you had me.
You so had me.
♪ Happy birthday,<br/>dear hammond ♪
Oh! ♪ happy birthday to you ♪
Robin:<br/>So, you
Didn't fire him?
I can't fire a guy<br/>on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.
Besides, they put a party hat<br/>on me.
My authority was compromised.
Oh, hey, marshall.
Have a seat.
I know how much you love stools.
Mm, thanks.
Yeah, stools are better<br/>for your posture.
And, uh...
I... Got you a rose.
Thank you.
That's so sweet.
You guys are being...
(suddenly flat):<br/>So sweet.
Hey, guys.
Guess what I got.
A new dart.
Oh, wow, a new dart. Ted: Oh.
Hey, that new dart is great.
I did not know you were such<br/>a fan of new dart, barney.
Oh, yes, robin,<br/>I just love new dart.
Nude art.
Nude art.<br/>Nude art.
(laughing)
Okay, all right, so what, you<br/>guys found the painting, huh?
I knew this day would come.
How did you know that?
Because I didn't hide it<br/>very well.
Ted: So the story on the painting<br/>is that, back in college,
Lily wanted to do a nude study<br/>for her art class.
Marshall wasn't so<br/>into the idea.
Well, I just...
Don't think that some dude
Should drop trou just<br/>to pose for you.
It's for class,
And it's just that weird kid<br/>hunter from my freshman hall.
The frisbee dude<br/>with the soul patch?
He's like the hottest guy<br/>in school!
No, he's actually a<br/>little husky... Oh,
He's just huggable!
And complicated...
And a little bit of a jerk.
Just enough so you think<br/>maybe you can change him.
Okay, just forget it.
Call me old-fashioned,
I just think that I'm the only<br/>guy you should see naked.
Well, then you'll have to do it.
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?
We're not in high school<br/>anymore.
People don't make fun of you<br/>for posing nude for a painting.
We're adults now.
We totally saw your butt.
(both laughing)
(mocking laugh)
This painting has caused<br/>too much grief already.
I'm destroying it right now.
(mockingly): Oh, no, what's<br/>the matter, marshall?
Where is it?
I'll tell you where it is
If you'll answer<br/>these riddles three.
You hung it up in the bar,<br/>didn't you?
Yo, why you gotta<br/>ruin my riddles?
Oh...!
Field trip!
(giddy laugh)
(screams)
Barney:<br/>Oh, no.
Someone put your painting<br/>up behind the bar.
Classic!
What a memorable prank.
Hey, marshall.
What'll you have?
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer
And that nude painting of me<br/>hanging behind the bar!
Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's<br/>property of the bar.
I know that barney gave you<br/>that painting.
I don't know<br/>what you're talking about.
Whatever he's paying you,<br/>I'll pay you double.
I doubt it.
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that<br/>plus ten bucks.
I doubt it.
All right, you know what, carl,
You just lost yourself<br/>a regular customer.
I doubt it.
This painting is the worst thing<br/>that's ever happened to me.
Okay, where should<br/>we put it up next?
In his law school?
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh! How much<br/>do billboards cost?
Easy, scherbatsky.<br/>Finesse.
I've got a five-year<br/>rollout plan.
I'll have you know<br/>that painting's
Got commitments<br/>all over the city.
Then, after new york...
(screaming) I'm thinking.
Heh-yah!
Hey!
One of my worst fears<br/>has come true...
I just saw marshall<br/>grabbing himself naked.
Well, I gotta go.
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.
Oh, I'll go out with you.
Bye, guys.
You know, I wish everyone didn't<br/>have to make fun
Of that painting.
Eh, we're not making fun<br/>of the painting,
We're just making fun<br/>of marshall.
The painting's actually<br/>really great.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
You know, seeing it again<br/>makes me miss painting nudes.
What?
(whispering):<br/>Paint me.
What?
Paint me.
Who's that?
Who's out there?
Hammond, is that you?
Mosby?
Druthers and I were alone<br/>in the office.
If I was gonna fire him,
This would be the best chance<br/>I'd ever have.
Uh, look, just a second, ted.
Uh, no, I, I really need<br/>to talk to you.
Look, there's no easy way<br/>to say...
What, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm standing here wearing pants.
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?
Okay, fine, yes.
Not that it's any<br/>of your business
But my wife had a little spat<br/>a few weeks ago,
And I've been sleeping here<br/>until she cools off.
Okay, well, uh, you're right...<br/>That is none of my business.
Uh, look, there's no easy way<br/>to say this... I...
(voice breaking):<br/>Who am I kidding?
She's never gonna take me back.
Uh...
(sniffling, crying) it's okay.
What did you want to say to me?
Happy birthday, buddy.
Oh...
So, you've been living<br/>at the office?
Yes.
I'm an architect without a home.
You see the tragic<br/>irony in that?
Yeah, I do.<br/>'cause I design homes.
I see it.<br/>But I don't have a home.
Not lost on me at all.
But I don't understand... why<br/>don't you just go to a hotel?
You could be sleeping<br/>on a mattress instead of...
What appears to be torn-up<br/>drawings of my building.
The minute I go to a hotel,<br/>in any second,
She's going to call<br/>and tell me to come home.
She's a very special lady, ted.
She's quite... Mannish.
She gives me what I need.
Do you understand that?
Uh, no, I don't.
If you were lost<br/>in the wilderness,
She can provide for me.
Well, that's the dream.
I'm glad you came<br/>here tonight, ted.
Me too, hammond.
Call me ham.
No, thanks.
Hammy d?
No, I think just hammond.
So, I'm guessing you<br/>didn't fire him.
I was this close.
Ted: Meanwhile, lily<br/>had been up all night
In the grips of a dilemma.
Oh honey, you're awake?<br/>I'm awake.
Uh-huh.
I everything okay?<br/>Yeah.
I've kind of been wrestling<br/>with something.
What if I told you I had<br/>a way to pay for our honeymoon?
Baby, our honeymoon's<br/>already paid for.
We're going to howe caverns.
Well yeah, but... but what if<br/>we didn't want to spend
Our honeymoon in a cave?
It's not just a cave, it's<br/>a whole labyrinth of caves.
It's an underground adventure.
There's a cave
That's so dark that you don't<br/>even know you're in there.
I mean, we're going<br/>to experience
A whole new kind of dark.
Well, what if I found a way
To make a little extra money
So that we spend our honeymoon
Not in howe caverns,<br/>but in scotland?
Loch ness?
Yeah. And you know,<br/>edinburgh
And the highlands and glasgow...
Loch ness. Nessy.
Baby, I would love to search<br/>for the enchanted creature
Of the emerald loch, but...
We can't afford that.
Maybe we can.
Paint me.
Okay, I don't get this.
You've been making fun<br/>of that painting all this time
And now you want me<br/>to paint you?
We knew we could torture<br/>marshall because he has shame.
I do not.
In my body, where the shame<br/>gland should be,
There's a second awesome gland.
True story.
Yeah, that's not the gland<br/>I'm worried about painting.
(chuckles) yeah.
A nude barney is a challenge.
But I think you're talented<br/>enough to immortalize this.
Now is the time... I'm 31.
I'm at the peak<br/>of my physical beauty.
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it<br/>long, long ago.
Long ago.
Forget it.
I promised marshall he was the<br/>only guy I would ever see naked.
Aww...
I'll give you $5,000.
We're going to loch ness!
Yeah!
That cabby would not shut up.
Yeah, we should<br/>call him a gabby.
I think it, you say it.
Hey, uh...
Thanks for putting me<br/>up last night, buddy.
Give 'em hell.
Morning, team.
So, I have given it<br/>some thought,
And I say we revisit columns.
Oh, god, not this again.
Ted, a man in a toga
Just arrived and delivered<br/>a parchment.
Let me read it:<br/>(gibbering)
Oh! It's from ancient greece.
They want their basic<br/>architectural elements back.
(laughing):<br/>Oh, geez.
What?
You didn't hear me?
Toga, parchment...
(gibbering)
Can I see you for one second?
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.
(quietly):<br/>What are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
You slept on my couch,<br/>you ate my cereal.
I tossed you more toilet paper.
We ar friends.
But that doesn't magically make<br/>your bad ideas good.
What? I don't believe this!
You're, you're, you're<br/>wearing my clothes!
And my girlfriend's...
Sneakers... man, you have<br/>weirdly small feet.
Ted, I hope that you're<br/>not going to let
Our professional woes<br/>interfere with our friendship,
Because I really kind of<br/>need you right now.
Okay, let's get this over with.
Hey, hey! I don't want you<br/>phoning this in.
This painting could, someday,<br/>become a serious work of art.
I mean, you have been blessed<br/>with an amazing gift.
Thank you.
I meant me.
Now, I like how you captured<br/>marshall's essence.
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.
But me, I want something<br/>more regal.
Something my progeny<br/>could look at and say,
"there's stands<br/>barnabus stinson."
He was wise...
And strong.
I don't think your sword<br/>will fit.
(scoffs) I get that a lot.
Ted:<br/>And so, as lily began painting,
Marshall thought about<br/>the $5,000
And what his fiancée<br/>was doing to earn it.
This isn't right.
This isn't right at all.
Finally, he could take<br/>it no more.
Hold still.
Hold still.
Hold still!
Paint faster!
Okay, I guess it's time.
Drop your shorts.
(laughing):<br/>Yeah.
Wait, wait!
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...
Uh... Ah!
In a world without justice,<br/>one man...
Oh, just drop them!<br/>All right.
Oh!
No! No, this is not right!
We had a deal! Well, I'm<br/>going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!<br/>You...!
(barney groaning) it's over!
Lily, I can't let you<br/>go through with this!
(whispering): I found a castle we can<br/>stay in, but it's an extra two grand.
It's just not right!
It's beautiful and they say<br/>it's haunted.
I can't let the woman I love<br/>compromise her values for money!
I totally think we can get some<br/>more money out of him.
I'm never letting<br/>my fiancée, ever...!
Oh, you're still here?
Before you say anything,
I'll give you an extra five grand.<br/>We accept.
You people are so easy<br/>to control.
Dance for me, puppets, dance.
Ted:<br/>And that's how uncle barney
Paid for lily and marshall's<br/>honeymoon.
Come on, ted, listen,<br/>why don't we get back
And finish drawing the plans<br/>for a building
Which, in my opinion,<br/>is never going to get built,
So you and I can get out of here<br/>and grab a couple of beers.
No.
Look, hammond,
There's no easy way<br/>to say this but...
Messenger:<br/>Looking for hammond druthers.
Oh, that's me.<br/>I'm hammond druthers.
These are divorce papers.
You've been served.
Oh, god.
She's really going<br/>through with this.
So that's it. It's over.
There is no easy way<br/>to say this, but...
She's giving me<br/>the remains of wolfie?
My dog is dead?
Oh, my god.
I can't believe this.
She always played<br/>too rough with him.
Believe me, there is no easy<br/>way to say this...
Group:<br/>♪ happy birthday to you...
You've got to be kidding me!
Guys, you have no idea
How much this means<br/>to me right now.
Wait, his birthday<br/>was yesterday!
Yeah, but a bunch of us<br/>were up at the conference
In montreal, so we thought...
No! No birthday! No!
I got something to say
And I'm gonna get it out.
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,
And that your wife is<br/>divorcing you and that...
Your life is falling apart and that<br/>these guys missed your birthday.
And there is no easy way<br/>to say...
What are you doing?<br/>What's going on?
(gasping):<br/>Oh, god...
Oh, come on, you're not going<br/>to pull that, are you?
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling<br/>onto the ground.
Well, nice try, but guess what?
You're fired!
You're fired... you get it?<br/>You hear me?
You're gone! You're fired!
(staff applauding)
In my defense, I think<br/>we all suspected hammond
Might have been faking.
On the plus side,<br/>the emts seem to think
He's going to be just fine<br/>and, as you saw,
They did admit that I did not<br/>cause the heart attack,
Even if they said it<br/>a bit begrudgingly.
And there it was, rock bottom:
They all hated me.
But just when all seemed lost,
I had the greatest idea<br/>of my entire career.
Margarita fridays...<br/>Great idea, boss.
(everyone cheering)
Okay, it's done.
I'm gonna
Step out, so you can admire it.
Thank you very much, lily.
Marshall, do you have the money?
Yeah.
Let's get out of here!
Barney (distant):<br/>A smooth area?!
You gave me the ken doll?!
You gave...!
She left out little barney.
Barnacle junior.
My barnana is...
Barnito supreme.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, I've told you stories<br/>about all the big holidays:
Christmas...
Halloween...
Thanksgiving...
But one holiday was always<br/>my favorite... super bowl Sunday.
And there was one super bowl<br/>back in 2007
That I will never forget.
Marshall, you're on beer detail.
Lily, you're making<br/>the bean dip.
Uh, robin, you're on chips<br/>and pretzels, and barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do<br/>so you can just focus
On controlling<br/>your gambling problem.
(scoffs):<br/>"problem."
Oh, poor superman,
He should really do something<br/>about his flying problem.
It's not a problem if<br/>you're awesome at it.
And I will be going<br/>to quinn's to pick up
The world's greatest food,
The super bowl<br/>hot wings platter.
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal<br/>for those bad boys.
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.<br/>I'm crazy like that.
Here's the info<br/>for tomorrow night.
What's tomorrow night?
Oh, god, you didn't hear?
Mark died.
Oh...<br/>Oh, my god.
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
And I know it would have meant<br/>a lot to mark if you came.
You guys were<br/>his favorite customers.
Stay strong.<br/>Oh, wow.
Sorry. We're so sorry.<br/>Our condolences.
Oh...
Who was mark?
Barney:<br/>No idea.
Marshall:<br/>Not a clue.
Well, I guess<br/>we should go, right?
Marshall:<br/>Wait...
Tomorrow night at 6:00,<br/>that's the super bowl.
Okay, I feel terrible,
But the truth is<br/>we didn't know mike.
Mark. Mark, and as long<br/>as we send flowers,
I can't think of any reason<br/>we'd have to go.
Get out of here!
I never want to see your<br/>face in this bar again!
This soulless bastard
Just told me he can't<br/>come to mark's funeral
Because he wants<br/>to watch the super bowl.
Could you believe that?
You guys are coming, right?
Yes... Wouldn't miss it for the world.<br/>Oh, yeah.
Okay, here's the plan.
Record the game,<br/>go to the funeral
Pay our respects to matt...<br/>Mark.
Mark, and start watching<br/>only an hour late.
Okay, that's great, but just<br/>to make sure it records,
Maybe we should bow our heads
And say a quiet prayer<br/>to the tivo gods.
Almighty tivo,
We thank you for all<br/>the gifts you have given us:
The power to freeze<br/>live tv to go take a leak
Is nothing short of godlike.
Let's not forget fast-<br/>forwarding through commercials.
It seems greedy to ask<br/>anything more from you,
O magic box,
But if you malfunction<br/>and miss the super bowl,
We will destroy you in the<br/>alley with baseball bats.
Both:<br/>Amen.
We are not fast-forwarding<br/>through the commercials.
Yeah, they're the best part.
Oh, come on.<br/>Remember last year?
Who wants to watch a monkey<br/>in a coconut bra order a pizza?
(both laughing)
Lily: My god, that<br/>monkey was so cute!
The last time.
Seriously, that's the last time
I'm gonna call you today.
Okay.
Good-bye.
You didn't hang up either!
I know! You hang up!
You hang up!<br/>(laughs)
My bookie. Great guy.
So let me get this straight.
A funeral is the one<br/>time you don't suit up?
Have I taught you nothing, ted?<br/>Virtually.
Suits are full of joy.
They're the sartorial equivalent<br/>of a baby's smile.
"Sartorial"?
"Of or pertaining
To tailors or their trade."
Suits are for the living.
That's why when<br/>it's my time to r.I.P.
I'm going out of this world<br/>the same way I came into it...
Buck naked. Yeah.
It's gonna be awesome.
Open bar for the guys,<br/>open casket for the ladies.
♪ What up?!
That's so funny!<br/>Like that?
All:<br/>Oh...!
(sadly):<br/>Oh...
Such a waste.
I know.<br/>He was so young.
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
Double-breasted<br/>dolce &amp; gabbana.
It must be so frightened.
This is going faster<br/>than I thought.
We'll make an appearance<br/>at the bar for the wake,
We'll be watching<br/>the game by 8:00.
And even though<br/>we didn't see any whales,
Mark and I both said it was<br/>the best day of our lives.
Hmm.<br/>Hmm.
Okay, I'm getting us<br/>another round.
And when I come back,
Everyone else is telling<br/>their favorite mark story.
Oh...
Dibs on the one carl just told.
Okay, I have to be<br/>at work exactly
One super bowl from now.
Oh, let's face it, we're not<br/>going to get to watch it.
We should just find out<br/>the score.
Oh, thank god!<br/>I'll find out.
We have to watch<br/>the game together.
It's tradition.
Think of all the great times<br/>we've had watching this game.
Second down, everyone drink.
Ted, it's not a drinking game
If you drink anytime<br/>anything happens.
Are these chicken wings<br/>or angel wings?
God, I love these things.
I love you guys.
This is so great,
All of us watching<br/>the super bowl together.
This is special.
We need to do this<br/>every year... promise me!
Calm down, buddy.
Oh, commercials!
Everyone drink!
(all groan)
God, this is such<br/>a great tradition,
All of us watching<br/>the game together.
How did this start?
Hey, barney, I bet you 20 bucks
That casey misses<br/>this field goal.
I don't bet.<br/>Betting's for suckers.
Make it like a dollar<br/>or something, you know.
Who cares? No big deal.
Fine.
(all groan)
See, there you go, he made it.
You win.
Wait. This is mine,<br/>just like that?
God, that feels good.
No, that feels really... Good.
What else can we bet on?
Nothing, it's the halftime show.
Oh, so lame.
Nobody even pays attention.
I mean, janet jackson,<br/>who cares?
(whispering):<br/>God, how cool is robin?
I can't believe you invited
This girl we've only known
For a few months<br/>to our sacred day.
Now she's gonna be<br/>in all the pictures.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.<br/>I'll give you the seahawks
Plus six points for 500 bucks.
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
$50?! What fun is $50?!
Why don't we just bet air?!<br/>God, marshall!
Okay, $50.
Hey, I'll take that action.
Seahawks, but make<br/>it four points
And make it a grand.
Hey, these wings, are they<br/>chicken wings or angel wings?
Oh, commercials!
Monkey with a coconut bra.<br/>Hilarious.
Look, we always watch<br/>the super bowl together.
So we make a pact<br/>to watch it tomorrow at 6:00
And go the next 18 hours<br/>without finding out who won.
That's impossible.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.
That means no tv, no internet,
No newspapers, nothing.
Media blackout.
But our tradition lives on.
Who's in?
I'm in.
I'm in.<br/>I'm in.
What the hell, I'm in.<br/>High five!
Dude, we're at a wake.
Sorry. Solemn low five.
None of us had any idea<br/>how hard it would be
To go nine hours<br/>without hearing the outcome
Of the super bowl.
I decided to work from home<br/>to avoid contamination
By the outside world.
(anxious muttering)
Hey, take this<br/>key and swallow it.
What? No.
Come on, ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.
Lots more, no.
I'm not messing around,<br/>theodore.
I've got a lot of money<br/>riding on this game.
If I don't handcuff myself<br/>to this radiator,
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.
Fine.
But only because
You didn't think through<br/>a bathroom plan
And I think that's funny.
(groans)
The media blackout<br/>was particularly hard on robin
Because, well,<br/>she was the media.
But unfortunately,<br/>the city won't be fixing
The unusually large<br/>pothole any time soon,
So buckle up<br/>if you're on the bqe.
It's gonna be a bumpy one.
Like morning commutes<br/>needed to get any harder.
You're right, kevin.
Well, robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in
With sid for a sports update.
No!
What?<br/>No.
But it's, uh, time for sports.
No, it's not.
It's time for weather.
We, we just did weather.
Well, weather's pretty fickle,
It may have changed.
What's it doing out there, lou?
Pretty much the same thing<br/>it was two minutes ago.
Back to you, robin.
Okay, now it's time for sports.
No! Let's go<br/>to traffic todd
In the metro news 1<br/>gridlock chopper...
Robin, it's time for sports!
Over to you, sid.
(hesitatingly): Thank<br/>you, kevin and robin.
Let's talk about the super bowl.
Weeks earlier,<br/>marshall had promised lily
He'd come into her kindergarten<br/>class for show-and-tell day.
And he's a little bit<br/>double-jointed...
Ah?
And his favorite animal
Is the loch ness monster.
Lily, how many times...?
Nessie is a gentle creature.
We're trying to stay away<br/>from terms like "monster."
Well, I think
We can all agree, he<br/>is much more interesting
Than sally's<br/>one-eyed goldfish.
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, sally.
Okay, well, that's<br/>all the time we have.
Arts and crafts, everybody.
Hey.
I'm doug.
Oh, hey, I'm marshall.
Are you going to be staying<br/>here for the rest of day?
Yeah, I'm actually trying<br/>to hide out
'cause I don't want to know<br/>who won the super bowl.
I know who won.
Oh, um, that's great,<br/>but I really don't want to know,
So if you could just<br/>keep that to yourself.
How badly do you<br/>not want to know?
Excuse me?
Ten bucks.
Are you serious?
Just went up to eight.
Unlock me, ted.
I've never gone this long
Without calling my bookie.
He worries.
Not until game time.
Where are you going?
Pick up the hot wings.
What?
How the hell are you<br/>planning on getting
In and out of a sports bar<br/>without seeing the score?
There's tvs everywhere.
Ah, don't worry.
I got it all planned out.
First of all:
I placed duct tape
So I can only see<br/>out of two tiny holes.
Next, I constructed blinders<br/>out of an old cereal box.
Top it all off: High-tech<br/>noise-reducing headphones
I bought when marshall and lily<br/>first got back together
And were doing it a lot.
I call it<br/>the sensory deprivator 5000.
Sorry.
(tv playing in background)
(breathy silence)
(loud): Hello! Uh, my<br/>name is ted mosby.
I'm here to pick up<br/>my hot wings.
In my hand, you'll find<br/>the exact total for the wings
Plus a generous tip.
Please take the cash.
Put the wings in my hand
(low, distant):<br/>And I'll be on my way.
Thank you!
And that closes the book<br/>on one heck of a super bowl.
Back to you, kevin and robin.
La, la, la, la, la,<br/>la, la, la, la, la...
We'll be right back.
(news theme plays)
Woman:<br/>And we're clear.
Robin:<br/>Sorry.
Um, robin, is it just me,
Or were you doing something<br/>different there?
I haven't watched the game yet.
I'm begging you, for<br/>the rest of the newscast,
There can't be any references<br/>to who won the super bowl.
I mean, change the teleprompter.
No team names, nothing specific.
That is crazy.<br/>I can't do that.
(cries): My friend mark<br/>passed away this week.
(crying) okay, sweetie, okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.
Back in five...
Four...<br/>Oh, I know.
Three...<br/>It's just so hard.
(news theme plays)
(groans)
(sighs)
Ha!
Who's the idiot now?!
You said the sensory deprivator<br/>5000 was stupid.
But it totally worked!
I couldn't see or hear anything<br/>happening around.
Right?! Right?!
No...!
Oh!
I was about to have<br/>a horrible realization.
Where's the dipping sauce?
(ominous chord plays)
The team that won,
Want to know what<br/>their name rhymes with?
Come on, dude.<br/>You promised you'd stop
If I ate all those crayons.
Why are you doing this?
I'm in love with miss aldrin.
Well, you can't have<br/>miss aldrin, she's mine.
(figure shattering)
Okay, now who did this?
I did.
Does that mean marshall<br/>gets a time-out?
Well, marshall's<br/>a grownup, so...
When one of us breaks something,<br/>we get a time-out.
Sorry.
And after the super bowl,
The mayor of the losing team's<br/>city had to pay up,
Sending the mayor of<br/>the winning team's city
15 pounds of a delicacy<br/>his or her city is famous for.
Better fire up whatever type<br/>of grill, steamer or fryer
One might use to cook that<br/>delicacy, winning team's mayor.
(fierce whisper):<br/>Hey.
Hey.
I'm not talking to you.
Yes, you are.
You'll do whatever I say.
Hold your breath.
I'm not holding my breath.
The winning team was the...
(inhales deeply)
Now here's how this<br/>is going to work:
You're going to take me to<br/>three r-rated movies a week...
And then uncle marshall<br/>got an idea.
It was not one he was proud of<br/>in retrospect,
But desperate times...
Oh, no.
Somebody wet their pants.
No, I didn't.
Oh, really?
Who's everyone gonna believe?
I'm a grownup third-year<br/>law student at columbia
And you're just<br/>a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:
You want to be able<br/>to quietly sneak off
Or am I gonna have something<br/>for show and tell today?
Hey, everyone...
Okay, okay.
You win.
I want my money back.
And your pudding snack pack.
Sir, who won the super bowl?
Sorry.<br/>I missed the game.
You missed...?! How could<br/>he miss the super bowl?
Excuse me!
Who won the super bowl?!
I... Don't really<br/>follow sports.
Oh, my...!
Emmitt smith!
Oh, thank god.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You got to tell me,<br/>who won the super bowl?
The game was last night?
You know, once you win<br/>two or three of those things,
It's kind of like, eh.
But you're emmitt smith.
You're a football player,<br/>it's super bowl Sunday.
What could possibly be more<br/>important than football?!
Dance, my friend. Dance.
No...!
(breathy silence)
(shouts):<br/>Hello! It's me again.
Oh!
I didn't recognize you.
Yeah, you forgot to give me<br/>the dipping sauce!
Ah.
Yes.
This is the one.
It was 4:00,
And so far, all of us<br/>had done the impossible.
But then, almost simultaneously,
Things started to go wrong.
And let's end the day<br/>on a happy note.
There is a new arrival<br/>at the bronx zoo.
Trish sanchez has the story.
(weather report plays on radio)
Hey, buddy.<br/>Hey, dude, look out.
(breathy silence)
And in honor of yesterday's<br/>big win...
(stations changing)
The super bowl... there is<br/>no more bitter defeat in sports
Than to lose one.
Hey, buddy, look out.<br/>Dude, watch out!
The zoo decided to name<br/>the baby panda
After super bowl champions...
No...!
No...!
No...!
Yes...!
Awesome. Just in time<br/>for the kick-off.
Mission accomplished. No.<br/>Didn't find out.
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded<br/>through the four hours
Of pre-game coverage,<br/>so we are ready.
Barney,
I can't even look at you.
I don't want any sign<br/>of who won.
Don't worry, I'm not going<br/>to give anything away.
Feel free to start without me.
(door closes) ah...!
Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
So much money! You<br/>screwed it up, barney!
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
(calm):<br/>Okay, let's watch the game.
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.
Now you've ruined<br/>the game for everyone.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, barney.
Way to blow it.
Yeah, I didn't know<br/>and now I do know.
There's no point in<br/>even watching the game.
Well, at least the<br/>commercials aren't ruined.
Wings are still good.
Beer still works.
Ah, what the hell.
Let's watch barney<br/>lose some money.
Hey, so check this out:
I got extorted by<br/>a five-year-old today.
I almost got fired today.
I met emmitt smith today.
Ooh, you go first.
I tried out the sensory<br/>deprivator 5000.
Yeah, go ahead, barney.
Well, I was frantically<br/>running down the street,
Trying to find out<br/>the score to the game...
Ted:<br/>And here's the funny part,
As unforgettable<br/>as that super bowl was,
Here it is 23 years later<br/>and I don't remember who won...
(cheering)
Hell, I don't even remember<br/>who played.
What I do remember<br/>is that we drank beer,
We ate wings and we watched<br/>the super bowl together.
(cheering)
Because, sometimes,<br/>even if you know
How something's going to end,
That doesn't mean<br/>you can't enjoy the ride.
We even raised a toast<br/>to good old mike.
I mean mark... Matt...
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.
Total penalty yardage,
Number of replay-challenges,
Coin toss...
What are the odds of losing<br/>the coin toss?
50-50, give or take.
Interceptions, field-goals,
Total sacks,
Whether or not there'd<br/>be a safety, first...
(breathy silence)
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, never underestimate<br/>the power of destiny.
Because when you<br/>least expect it,
The littlest thing<br/>can cause a ripple effect
That changes your life.
Take for instance<br/>my trip to chicago.
That security guard<br/>was a little bit handsy.
That's funny. She<br/>barely touched me.
Uh, gate 23.<br/>Come on.
If we miss this flight,<br/>I will never forgive myself.
Why was this flight<br/>so important?
Let's back up a few months<br/>to the fall of 2006.
I had just sold my first<br/>building design
And become the youngest project<br/>manager in my firm's history.
Suddenly I was being headhunted.
One firm was even considering me
To run their<br/>entire new york office.
They were flying me in<br/>for a final interview
At their corporate headquarters<br/>in chicago.
It was the opportunity<br/>of a lifetime.
It was my destiny.
There was just one problem.
Hi, wait, two more.
Sorry, you're too late,<br/>I already shut the doors.
Well, I'm sure if we pull<br/>real hard we can open them.
Hmm, I wish it<br/>worked like that, but see,
Once I close<br/>those doors, that's it.
Nobody else is allowed<br/>down that jet-way.
Except for that guy.
Please, if-if<br/>I miss this flight,
I'll miss the chance to<br/>interview for my dream job.
I'm sorry, sir.
His dream job!
Didn't you ever<br/>have a dream job?
Something from when<br/>you were a little girl,
That was all you wanted to do?
I mean, for god's sakes,<br/>I'm sure you didn't
Go to bed at night<br/>dreaming about being a...
I mean, uh...
This is a cool job.
Please, I have to be<br/>on this flight.
I'll see what I can do.
But it doesn't look good.
Thanks.
Your uniforms are pretty.
Okay.
They haven't<br/>armed the doors yet,
So you still have a chance.
It's up to the captain now<br/>and they're calling us back.
Great, please let us know<br/>soon as you hear anything.
Sure, and for the future,<br/>we recommend you arrive
At the airport an hour and<br/>a half before your flight,
Not, you know, one minute after.
Normally,<br/>I'm incredibly responsible.
I just had to go to court<br/>this morning and get sentenced.
Not that I'm<br/>a criminal or anything.
Yeah, he just jumped<br/>a subway turnstile.
You seem to have<br/>a lot of problems
With the rules of travel.
(phone rings)
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that is great news.
It's my mom...<br/>She found her missing earring.
Have a seat.
I'll call you<br/>when I hear something.
Where was it?
That thing better<br/>have call waiting.
Could you just call the firm
And explain what happened?
It's down to three<br/>people and I know
They need to make<br/>their decision today.
I sort of feel my not showing up<br/>might put me at a disadvantage.
(laughing):<br/>I'm so stupid.
Why did I have<br/>to jump that turnstile?
Hey, don't be so<br/>hard on yourself.
And isn't this whole thing<br/>really barney's fault?
She had a point.
It was kind of barney's fault.
Remember?
Let's back up a few months.
Oh, marshall,<br/>how's the broken toe?
Oh, man, it kills.
You want some aspirin, baby?
You know I don't believe<br/>in pain killers.
Wow, your first broken bone.
Kind of kills your whole<br/>"unbreakable" theory.
Marshall used to think
He was indestructible.
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.
I've never been sick,
And when I need to, I can summon
Incredible strength.
Ted, tell her the story<br/>of the really heavy door.
There was a really heavy door.
He opened it.
On one pull.
Whoo!
Well, you must be really bummed,
You're not gonna<br/>be able to run tomorrow.
Yeah. It sucks,<br/>all that work
I put in training for the<br/>marathon was a total waste.
Training for a marathon.
What?
You don't need<br/>to train for a marathon.
You just run it.
You're kidding, right?
Not at all.
I could run a marathon<br/>anytime I wanted to.
So like tomorrow,
You think you could<br/>wake up, roll out of bed,
And just run<br/>the new york city marathon?
Absolutely.
Barney, we're talking<br/>about 42 kilometers.
Thanks, canada.
I'll take it from here.
Barney, it's like 26 miles.
Here's how you run a marathon.
Step one, you start running.
There is no step two.
Okay, you know what?<br/>Prove it.
Take my number
And run in my place.
I will bet you
50 bucks you don't<br/>even finish the race.
50 bucks?
Gee, grandpa, if I win,
Maybe I can buy myself<br/>an ice-cream cone.
Make it $10,000.
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.
Fine, then no bet.
Okay, $50.
The next morning,<br/>as the marathon began,
We were focused<br/>on marshall's computer.
Each runner gets a tracking chip
So you can follow them online,
See when they pass certain<br/>checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.
Ooh, he's starting!
(chuckling):<br/>This ought to be good.
Marshall:<br/>Wow.
He's already passing<br/>the second checkpoint.
This tracking thing is amazing.
When we get married,
You're getting one of these.
Robin:<br/>Wow.
Look at his time.<br/>It's pretty impressive.
He's gotta be cheating, okay.
He knew we'd check.
Yeah, he'll do anything<br/>to win a bet.
Remember that time he bet me
That men at work sang<br/>"hungry like the wolf,"
And when he found out<br/>that they didn't,
He tried to hire them to?
Well, it looks like,
"barney" should be coming<br/>over the queensboro bridge
And up first avenue<br/>within the next hour or so.
But... There is no way that<br/>that's really him.
It's really him.
Hey! That's mine.
Yeah, you'd better run!
What up, non-finishers?
Wow.
Amazing. Wow. Very<br/>impressive, barney.
Right?<br/>Wow.
Yeah, my time would have been
Like a hour an hour better,
But I met this total hottie<br/>on mile seven.
We took a quick detour
And had our own mini marathon<br/>behind a nathan's.
I won.
I'm not sure anyone<br/>in that story is a winner.
So where's my 50 bucks?
All right.
(chuckles)
I got to admit, you earned this.
Huh?
Can't believe they haven't made<br/>a coin for this yet.
Anyway,
I'm heading home.
Might go hit the gym.
Oh, hey, just so you know, uh,
All marathon runners get
To use the subway<br/>for free today.
Wow. You know I really should<br/>check out this "subway."
Heard so much about it.
Wow.
Look at me. Slumming it.
Maybe I'll make<br/>a weekend out of it
And I'll call my bridge<br/>and tunnel girl tonight.
You're dating a girl<br/>from new jersey?
No.
(phone ringing)<br/>so barney did it.
He actually finished<br/>the marathon.
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.
Hello?
Ted, it's barney.
Listen to me, I need you to come<br/>and pick me up on the subway.
What, what are you talking<br/>about?
I was sitting here, totally<br/>minding my own business.
Finisher.
Yeah, you know, what I mean.
Man (over p.A.):<br/>86th street.
My legs don't work.
I've already ridden the subway
Twice end to end.
I've seen where it turns around.
Ted, you don't ever want to see<br/>where the subway turns around.
Barney's legs won't work.
He's riding the subway
From end to end<br/>because he physically
Can't get off the train.
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
Listen to me, ted.
I'm going to lose you<br/>any second.
I'm on the fourth car<br/>of the six train heading south
From pelham bay park<br/>in the bronx.
Meet me at the 86th street<br/>station in, like, half an hour?
All right.
I'll be right there.
Stay where you are.
Ted, ted.
Oh, come on.
You're not even going to<br/>give up your seat for him?
I'm sorry. I can't.
Douche.
Barney?!
Ted!
Hey!
(grunting)
No...!
See?
If barney never tried<br/>to run the marathon,
You never would have<br/>jumped that turnstile,
You wouldn't have had<br/>that court date today,
And we would have<br/>made this flight.
You're right.
Everything can be traced back<br/>to him.
Like that rash we all got<br/>at christmas.
All right, I have<br/>to see what's going on.
So I was able<br/>to get you two seats.
Really? That's great!<br/>No, no, not you.
I'm talking to my mom<br/>about blue man group.
Ma, can I call you back?
Okay, what about our<br/>flight? Can we get on?
I'm still waiting for...
Huh.
Looks like your flight left<br/>already.
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in chicago today.
Well, he never even<br/>called you back?
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work<br/>and they don't call you back
After you spend two nights with<br/>them at a radisson in orlando.
It turned out<br/>there was one other flight
That would just barely get me<br/>to chicago on time
For my job interview,
But it was all the way on<br/>the other side of the airport.
Robin: What was the name<br/>of the airline again?
I think it was something<br/>like flights r' us.
Was the "r" backwards?
God, I hope not.
Geez.<br/>Stupid smart carts.
More like dumb carts.
If we miss this flight,<br/>it's all barney's fault.
You know, barney never<br/>would have run the marathon
In the first place if marshall<br/>hadn't broken his toe.
Yeah, so?
What, you think<br/>this is my fault?
For marshall, the initial idea
To run the marathon came<br/>way back in April.
My pants are starting<br/>to feel a little tight.
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.
I cannot allow this.
What?
I am going to run<br/>the new york city marathon.
(john cafferty's<br/>"heart's on fire" playing)
Lily:<br/>"it is important to load up
"on carbohydrates two<br/>to four hours before a big run.
"Try a breakfast
"of a bagel, a banana,
Oatmeal, strawberries<br/>and some orange juice."
Here you go, marshmallow.
Just like the book said.
Yeah, but from now on,
I'm eating all of my<br/>breakfast runner-style.
Liquids are digested faster.
That way, no energy is wasted,
And it's all about the run.
(whirring)

This is gonna be<br/>your best run yet.
You're going<br/>to accomplish all of your goals.
(staccato rhythm):<br/>You are a robot sent
From the future<br/>to win the marathon!
You are... Marshall.
You are...<br/>Marshall.
You are marshall!
Yeah!

Oh.
Oh...
(panting)
Oh!
Oh, gosh!
(exhales loudly)
Oh.
Oh.
Ah.
Oh!
(exhales)
Dude, you are a terrific runner.
Tomorrow you're gonna run
And finish<br/>the new york city marathon!
You're the best.
You look good.
Nobody does it better than you.
Marshall?<br/>Oh, my god!
What? Aah!
(thudding)
So, yes, it was your fault.
I mean, if you don't<br/>show up at the apartment
In the middle of the day,<br/>marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,
I don't jump the turnstile<br/>and get a court date,
And we make our flight<br/>in plenty of time!
(thudding) oh!
And I don't fall down
And bite my tongue<br/>at the airport.
That really wasn't my fault.
I wouldn't have walked in<br/>on marshall
If it weren't for lily.
Hey, think about it.
Hey, what's going on here?
Oh, looks like they're<br/>camping out for something.
Yeah, but for what?<br/>I don't know.
Usually there's a stormtrooper<br/>or klingon in line
To give you some indication.
Hmm.
"Annual wedding dress blowout."
"Designer sample dresses<br/>up to 90% off."
Whoa.
"Doors open tomorrow,<br/>8:00 a.M." oh, my god.
Can you believe what<br/>some nut bags will do
To save a few bucks?<br/>Geez.
We have to camp out.
Are you serious?
You don't understand.
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before, but<br/>I never knew where it was.
(gasps) we'll have a<br/>wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.
I can't go.<br/>I've got this thing.
What thing?<br/>A penis.
This is the place.
Oh, wow.
Badgley mischka!<br/>Melissa sweet!
(gasping) vera wang!
Oh, robin, do you have any idea
What you guys<br/>stumbled onto here?
(giggles) you said wang.
Oh!
Oh, this reminds me
Of the ticket line<br/>to lilith fair, 1998.
(laughs) only fewer mullets.
You should feel good.
You're only, like, the tenth
Craziest bride in new york.
(laughs)
(sighs)
Ooh, this is comfy.
We might actually<br/>be able to sleep.
(car alarm blaring)
That's kind of annoying.
Well, I'm sure somebody<br/>will be out here
To turn it off any minute.
(sighs)
(car alarm blaring)
I don't think I can take this.
Every time it<br/>turns off, I think,
Oh, maybe<br/>it won't turn on again,
But then it does.
Why does it, robin?
Why does it keep turning on?
It's gonna be okay,<br/>sweetie. Why...
Why don't we make a game<br/>out of it, okay?
Why don't we sing along?
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh!
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Both:<br/>♪ ooh...!
♪ Ooh!
♪ Mah, mah, mah, mah...
(crying):<br/>Oh, no.
(alarm continues blaring)
If we get through this,
I swear I'm gonna live<br/>my life differently.
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.
(car alarm chirps)
Morning, ladies.
It's him. It's<br/>the car guy!
Get out of here!
(all shouting at once)
Hey! Ow!
(shouting continues)
Ted: The next morning,<br/>robin was too tired
To go all the way back<br/>to brooklyn,
So while I was at work,<br/>she went to crash
At my apartment<br/>for a couple hours,
And that's when...
Nobody does it better than you.
Marshall?!<br/>Oh, my god!
What? Aah!
(thudding)
So if lily hadn't dragged me<br/>down to the wedding dress store,
We would have made<br/>the first flight.
Oh, thank god. The<br/>doors are still open.
We made it.<br/>Oh.
Hi. Please.
We really need to<br/>get on this flight.
Oh, my god!
You're that reporter<br/>from metro news 1.
Yes, yes, I am.
I can't believe<br/>you recognized me.
You did that story on the<br/>giant pizzas, huh? Yeah.
Would you check to see
If you have any more seats?<br/>One moment, sir.
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?
Robin...<br/>One second, ted.
Um, you know, a lot<br/>of people ask me that.
The truth is,<br/>the pizzas were real.
Calzones. Trick photography.<br/>I knew it!
God, it is so nice to meet a fan!<br/>Ah.
And I would be a fan<br/>of your work
If you could get us two seats<br/>on that next flight.
Well, the, uh, flight attendants
Are just finishing up<br/>their final seat count.
Let me see what I can find out.
Would it help if I got on
And gave an impassioned speech<br/>about my destiny?
I think it might hurt.
This is such a nightmare.
Okay, so we agree?
This goes back to lily<br/>wanting to camp out
For a wedding dress?
No.
Wait. It goes back further.
Remember why we were eating<br/>hot dogs on the east side?
(subway car whirring)
(quiet grunt)
1939?!
This penny's from 1939!
A 67-year-old penny.
Do you realize this<br/>penny was minted
During world war ii?
Oh, so was my grandfather,
But that doesn't make him<br/>interesting.
Look, I know a little<br/>something about coins,
And this baby is worth<br/>something to a collector.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is!<br/>You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner
With the money I get<br/>for this little guy.
And that's exactly what I did.
You're lucky there's still<br/>a place that serves anything
For a dollar fifty.
Hey, that's 150 times<br/>its original value.
Actually, the meal<br/>was only $1.49.
1984.
Hey, in 50 years,<br/>we can get dinner again.
How dare you.
(giggles)
Hey, what's going on?
I don't know. Looks like they're<br/>camping out for something.
Yeah, but for what?
It was me.
I started this.
If I hadn't picked up that<br/>penny, we wouldn't have gone
To get hot dogs<br/>all the way across town.
Robin: And we wouldn't have<br/>seen that wedding dress store,
Lily wouldn't have wanted<br/>to camp out there,
And I wouldn't have needed
A nap at your apartment<br/>the next day.
Ted: Marshall wouldn't<br/>have broken his toe.
Barney wouldn't have run<br/>the marathon.
I wouldn't have jumped<br/>that turnstile,
Gotten arrested,<br/>had that court date...
And we would have made our flight.<br/>Oh!
I don't think we can go<br/>back any further than that
Unless you know who<br/>dropped the penny.
I wish I did.
Though that person's already<br/>been punished enough,
Losing a sweet penny like that.
Uh, sir?
Oh, please tell me<br/>you have some good news.
Uh, I'm afraid not. (sighs)
There are no extra<br/>seats on the plane.
I'm sorry.
All, right, well,<br/>thanks for trying.
I can't believe this.
That's it, it's over.
Ted, come on.
Your destiny
Just wasn't to make<br/>it to chicago today.
Anyway, if that firm<br/>really wants you,
They'll reschedule.
Ted:<br/>But that's not what happened.
They didn't reschedule.
They hired someone else.
And as it turned out,<br/>three months later,
That guy ended up having<br/>to relocate to chicago.
Kids, funny thing<br/>about destiny...
I thought I was destined<br/>to get that job.
But I was wrong.
My destiny was to stay<br/>in new york.
Because if I hadn't,
I never would have met<br/>your mother.
(subway car chugging<br/>and whooshing)
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, the key to a good<br/>relationship is communication;
You need to talk.
How about mimi's? Nah, I don't<br/>really feel like mimi's.
Well, I'm hungry.<br/>Let's just pick a place and go.
Oh, you know where<br/>we should go? Cynthia's.
You love that place...<br/>Remember what
A great time we had the last<br/>time we were there? We did?
Yeah, yeah.<br/>We had that crazy waiter
(french accent): Who kept going,<br/>"you two should get married!"
You two should get married!"
It's also important to know<br/>when to stop talking.
Come on. Then we<br/>stepped outside.
It was raining.<br/>It was so romantic?
How can you not remember this?
Because it wasn't me.
Oh, right!
It was... My sister.
You see, by the time<br/>you've hit your late 20s,
You've dated a few people,
But when you're in<br/>a relationship,
It's common courtesy<br/>to pretend that you haven't.
Oh, my god, van helsing is on.
Remember when we went to see it?
We sat in the back row.
I've never seen van helsing.
That's right.<br/>I saw it with my sister.
My boss just got back from maui.
He said it was really romantic.
Oh, it's so romantic.
When were you in maui?
I... Went...
With my sister.<br/>With my sister.
Why do you always say that?
Look,
We're not 16.
We've both dated other people.
It's silly to try<br/>to act like we didn't.
You're right.<br/>We should just be honest.
Totally.
See that girl over there?
Three years ago,
I totally made out with her.
I don't want to hear that.
What? You said...
God, that is so insensitive.
Remember honesty...?<br/>You're a jerk!
Well, you're...
Confusing.
Okay, so you have<br/>to have sex with one:
Either classic mermaid; bottom<br/>half fish, top half human,
Or inverted mermaid, top half<br/>fish, bottom half human. Go!
I don't know. Is she fat?
Yeah, but it's a fish,<br/>so it's the good kind of fat.
Hot off the presses!<br/>I-I don't take flyers.
You took one two seconds<br/>before you walked in here.
That's different.<br/>It was for a strip club.
Two bucks off wings.
How much is your flyer<br/>going to save me on wings?
Fine. It's a flyer<br/>from my play.
Oh, lily, I'd love to,<br/>but we're not in college
And I'm not trying<br/>to sleep with you.
So anyway, this mermaid...
Hey, lily's friend asked<br/>her to be in this play,
And it's gonna be really good.
Lily, I love you,<br/>but we're too old for this.
Asking someone<br/>to come see your play
Is like asking someone<br/>for a ride to the airport
Or to crash on your couch<br/>or to help you move.
Call a cab, book a room,
Hire some movers<br/>and repeat after me:
Friends don't let friends<br/>come see their crappy play.
Ted:<br/>Okay, first of all,
I've thought about it
And top half fish.
Second of all, we need you guys
To decide something for us.
Yes, you should break up.
So, earlier tonight...
Mm, we should<br/>get down to the bar.
I know we should,
But you just look so sexy<br/>in my red sweatshirt.
Mm...
Mm...<br/>Mm...
Oh, god, why is this<br/>part of the story?
We're getting to it.
Damn, my face is so dry.
Is there any moisturizer<br/>around here?
Yeah, there's some<br/>in the bathroom.
Got to moisturize!
Got to keep that<br/>pretty face moist.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What's wrong with her?<br/>She hates that word.
What word, "moist"?
No! Seriously, stop!
So, anyway, ted goes<br/>into the bathroom
To get the moist...
Face lotion...
Wow, this is great stuff.
Now I know the secret<br/>to your great complexion.
What are you talking about?<br/>It's yours.
No, it's not.
Oh, well...
Then I guess it's lily's.
No, it's not.
Whose moisturizer is this, ted?
Um, my sister's.
So, in other words,<br/>some girl you went out with.
Um... I love you.
Disgusting. You let me put on<br/>the same moisturizer
As one of your exes?
It was probably carla's.
Her face was a train wreck.
I'm don't think ted was<br/>dating her for her face.
Thank you, marshall.
Thank you so much.
Why is that still<br/>in your apartment?
I don't know.<br/>I just never threw it out.
Well, why not? Do you still<br/>have feelings for this girl?
Yeah. I'm madly in love<br/>with her,
And the only way<br/>I can deal with it
Is by holding onto<br/>a three-dollar tube of lotion.
Not three dollars! Try 14.
Why is this such a big deal?
Because I don't want to use<br/>some whore's moisturizer!
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
Well, she's leaving expensive<br/>lotions all over town.
It sounds like a whore to me.
What else do you have
From old girlfriends<br/>just lying around?
Nothing. That's it.
Well, except<br/>for the phone booth.
And the lamp by the desk...
And the...
No.
No!
No!
Oh, ted!
Ah, the age-old<br/>question:
After you break up with someone,
What do you do with the stuff?
Question?<br/>Ain't no question, girl.
Obviously, he's got<br/>to get rid of it.
Which is obviously crazy
And obviously,<br/>I'm not gonna do it.
So we agreed that we would<br/>let you guys decide.
Yeah, like we did<br/>with marshall's pants.
Ah, the 2005 landmark case
Of lily v.<br/>The joey buttafuoco pants.
Huh?
Huh?
Nice, right?
I'm gonna have to say no.
I don't want some
16-year-old girl<br/>falling in love with you
And then shooting lily<br/>in the face.
Yes!
I vote they can stay.
"Check out the jackass<br/>in the parachute pants"
Is a good icebreaker.
Ted.
Ted? Ted?
Sorry, buddy, it's<br/>a "no" for me, too.
Oh, and by the way,<br/>bel biv devoe called.
Even they don't want<br/>those pants back.
They were insanely comfortable!
They were like pajamas<br/>you could wear outside.
Marshall, it's over.
We even gave you an appeal
And they didn't look any better<br/>with combat boots.
All right, well,<br/>let's hear the arguments.
Ted, you go first.
Okay. The fact that I still have<br/>things from ex-girlfriends
Is no big deal.
I mean, when I see the phone<br/>booth on the piano,
I don't think<br/>of jeannie radford,
I think of the good times I had<br/>backpacking through europe.
And when I see the lamp,<br/>I don't think of allison moses.
I remember when I was broke,<br/>just out of college,
And I really needed a lamp.
And when I see<br/>that throw pillow,
I don't think of lauren stein.
I think of that weird<br/>orange-brown stain
And how it got there.
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,
Not at the same time.
Well, that's adorable,
But from now on, when I<br/>walk into the apartment,
Here is what I will see.
I'm ted's college girlfriend.
He made me 12 mix tapes.
How many has he made you?
He calls you "sweetie pie"?
He called me<br/>"sweetie pie."
I'm stupid, but my rack<br/>is bigger than yours.
Really?
You can't look at a pillow
Without seeing my<br/>ex-girlfriend... a pillow!
Yes, ted, the fact<br/>that you still have that pillow
Is creepy and gross.
Well, you're creepy and gross.
Well, your mom's creepy<br/>and gross.
You're the...<br/>Order! Order!
I got to side with robin.
She's your girlfriend,
And if the stuff upsets her,<br/>you got to get rid of it.
I've got to side with ted.
Just 'cause you<br/>still have something
An ex-girlfriend gave you doesn't<br/>mean you're holding onto her.
Ted:<br/>All right, barney.
It all comes down to you.
I side with robin.
What?
Ted, your place<br/>is too cluttered.
It's like you're<br/>living in a bennigan's.
Or a danby's.
What, they don't have<br/>danby's in the us?
Really?
Well, then were do you get
Grizzly paw ice cream<br/>sandwiches?
Just stop, sweetie.
Ted:<br/>So I had no choice.
I packed up everything
I had gotten<br/>from ex-girlfriends.
It was painful,
But not as painful as what I<br/>had to endure later that night.
New york is famous<br/>for its theater,
But there's many<br/>different levels.
There's broadway, off-broadway,<br/>off-off-broadway,
Homeless people screaming<br/>in the park,
And then below that,<br/>the play aunt lily was in.
Eight flights of stairs.
Who puts a theater up<br/>eight flights of stairs?
What kind of building is this?
From the smell of it,<br/>I'm guessing a urine factory.
Hey, where do you guys<br/>want to sit?
I know where I don't<br/>want to sit.
Guys, four together!
I brought a bag in case<br/>anyone needs to puke.
Come on. It's not<br/>gonna be that bad.
No? Okay.
Shh.
(gong sounds)
I... Am... Rage!
I... Am greed.
(gong rings)
I am rage... Envy!
(quietly):<br/>I am outta here.
No, you're not.<br/>You have to stay.
This is the face of consumerism!
Oh, my god.<br/>Ted's part of the play.
(cast gasping)
Hello, greed, rage...
Envy...
And consumerism.
I...
Am your father...
America!
(cast gasping)
(cheering)
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!
Totally, I had no idea<br/>greed was the killer.
And when it became<br/>a play within a play,
I was, like, "now<br/>we are really cookin'!"
Wow, lily, that sucked!
Barney!
What? It was terrible.
I mean, come on.<br/>You guys agree, right?
Hey, sorry,<br/>I'm just being honest
'cause, you know, we're friends.
No, friends make each other<br/>feel good.
They build each other up<br/>and support them.
That's what being<br/>a good friend is about.
Yeah, if you're a smurf.
You know if you did a play,<br/>I would sit through
The whole thing and I would<br/>compliment you on it afterwards.
Oh, really? You would? Yes.
Bad move, aldrin, bad move.
(man clears throat)
We'll be starting
Our q&amp;a with the director...
Yours truly...<br/>In five minutes right here.
(chairs clanging loudly)
Can you believe barney<br/>said that about lily's play?
I know. He can be<br/>really insensitive.
Yeah... It was<br/>pretty bad, though.
Oh, my god, it was so bad.
Oh, my god, you've been robbed!
Nope.
All that stuff was<br/>from old girlfriends?
Don't you buy anything<br/>for yourself?
What can I say?
Papa gets swag.
Mmm...
And that should've been<br/>the end of it.
But the next day...
You know, at first<br/>I was really bummed
About getting rid<br/>of all my stuff.
But seeing how happy it makes<br/>you... totally worth it.
Mm, that's kind of how I<br/>feel when I begrudgingly
Have sex with you<br/>when I'm really tired.
Exactly. Sometimes you gotta<br/>take one for the team.
(growling)
Well, sit.
Sit, yeah.
So you never keep anything<br/>your ex-boyfriends gave you?
Nope.
Well, except for my dogs.
So I had to get rid<br/>of everything
From my past<br/>relationships because
You don't keep things<br/>from your past relationships
Except, uh, where are<br/>your five dogs from?
Oh, that's right:<br/>Your past relationships.
What's your point, ted?
Well, you know how you said
You come over to my apartment,
And all you can see<br/>are my ex-girlfriends?
What, so when you look<br/>at my dogs,
All you see is my ex-boyfriends?
Good boy.
I do now.
That's ridiculous.
I thought you said you got rid
Of everything<br/>your ex-boyfriends gave you.
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.<br/>You said everything.
But not living things.
Well, tell that to the rare<br/>bolivian cactus I threw away.
Things with a heartbeat<br/>can stay.
Enjoying this?
Pickles, go get your ball.
Go get your ball.
Just admit it.
It was a little<br/>hypocritical of you
To make me get rid<br/>of all my stuff.
Well, what do you<br/>want me to do, ted?
Get rid of my dogs?
Guess what position<br/>we did it in.
Yes. Yes, I want you<br/>to get rid of your dogs.
Um, no.
Really? Well, I say
We take it to the group,<br/>but I don't like your chances.
She's not getting<br/>rid of the dogs.
What's the matter with you?
Even I wouldn't do that.
Yes!<br/>Ugh!
You can ask somebody<br/>to get rid of their iguana
After it poops in your hair,<br/>but not their dog.
I miss jebediah.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Flyers for my new play.
Very funny.
Oh, it's not a joke.
It's my one-man show<br/>premiering tomorrow night.
And even though it's terrible<br/>and excruciatingly long,
I expect you all to be there<br/>since we're such good friends.
Oh, we'll be there.
Unless, of course, you just want<br/>to admit that you were wrong...
Never.<br/>Good.
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Bring a poncho;<br/>the first three rows get wet.
(clicks tongue)
I'm sorry I didn't tell you<br/>where the dogs came from.
I'm sorry I asked you<br/>to get rid of them.
That was ridiculous.
So we're-we're okay?
Yeah, we're great.
And I thought we were,
But just as it did
In the seventh act<br/>of aunt lily's play,
Jealousy reared its ugly head.
Oh, yeah, baby, that's the spot.
♪ So messed up,<br/>I want you here ♪
♪ But now I wanna<br/>be your dog... ♪
Dude, I gotta pee.
♪ Now I wanna be your dog
Sorry, I... I gotta go.
♪ Now I wanna be your dog...
(door shuts)
Oh, he's really having trouble<br/>dealing with this, huh?
Yeah, he really is.
It's got me thinking, maybe<br/>I should get rid of my dogs.
Might be time<br/>to send them to the farm.
You're gonna kill your dogs?!
No! No, no, no,<br/>there really is a farm.
My aunt has a farm upstate.
Oh, thank god.
Aw, you know, if I<br/>were five dogs,
I'd rather live on a farm than<br/>in an apartment in brooklyn.
Yeah. I could visit<br/>them on weekends.
My aunt is awfully<br/>lonely up there.
It's just her<br/>and her lover, betty.
Oh, that's perfect.<br/>They love dogs.
"They"?<br/>What do you mean by "they"?
Uh... Uh... Uh...
People upstate.
Oh, look, it's starting.<br/>Shh!
Are you sure<br/>you're gonna be okay?
I mean, you know that this<br/>is gonna be... I know,
But I'm gonna sit<br/>through the whole thing,
And I'm gonna say something<br/>nice about it afterwards.
You know why?
Because that's what friends do.<br/>Hmm.
(gong chimes)
Moist.
Moist.
Moist.
Moist.
Ted: That was the first 40<br/>minutes of barney's show.
Moist.
And then we endured<br/>about 20 minutes of this.
(sighs)
I have to go refill.
I'll be back in a moment.
Play's not over.
I never get picked for<br/>audience participation.
And then it just got weird.
(makes electrical buzzing<br/>sounds)
(staccato rhythm):<br/>Feelings.
Inside.
Oh, no!
Barney:<br/>Beep, beep, beep.
Beep.
(makes buzzing<br/>and whirring sounds)
(buzzing)
Ted:<br/>And when that didn't work...
(playing sprightly melody)
(stopping and starting)
(plays one high-pitched note<br/>over and over again)
Okay!
Stop!
You win. Fine.
Barney, I'm sorry<br/>I made you come to my show.
Thank you, lily.
Is there anything you'd like<br/>to say about my show?
No.
No, I have nothing nice<br/>to say about your show.
You were right, barney.
Let's go to the bar.
Yes!<br/>I win!
I love winning!
Oh, lily.
Oh, lily, lily, lily.
I was just getting warmed up,<br/>man!
If you had any idea what was<br/>coming up in act two... Oh!
Well, I imagine it was<br/>pretty awful, so let's go.
Pretty awful?<br/>Pretty awful?!
It was a masterpiece of awful.
It's genius how bad it is.
I kind of wish<br/>you guys could see it.
Yeah, well, anyway.
Act two is where<br/>I really hit my stride.
Spoiler alert:<br/>The robot falls in love.
How about this, barney?
How about we stay and-and watch<br/>the rest of your show?
It's your funeral.
Five, six, one, two.
(playing high-pitched melody)
So we stayed<br/>and let barney torture us
For another hour and a half,
'cause that's what friends do,<br/>apparently.
Hey.
Where've you been?
I called you earlier.
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
You what?
Yeah. Just for a few months<br/>as a test run, but...
I think it's for the best.
Wow.
Oh, man.
Aw...
Can we go inside?
Uh, no.
Uh, let's go to the bar.<br/>Why?
What's going on inside?<br/>Um, the floors are gone.
What? Yeah. I-I sent them<br/>out to get, um, fixed.
This is a terrible lie.
I'm just going to bail.
I didn't know you were getting<br/>rid of the dogs!
You said you threw<br/>all that stuff away!
Ted: Kids, this was the worst<br/>fight robin and I ever had.
It was one of those fights<br/>that last for hours
And you start to get woozy<br/>and lose track
Of what you're fighting about.
We fought for so long,
Seasons changed<br/>outside the window.
Pages of the calendar blew off.<br/>It was crazy.
But, ultimately,<br/>and I couldn't tell you how
For the life of me,<br/>but somehow we got to here.
We're really doing this?
Yeah.
We're moving in together!<br/>We're moving in together!
(joyous laughter)
Congratulations!<br/>Thank you.

I can't believe this<br/>moment's finally here.
One more mile and my<br/>little boy turns 200,000.

And just like an old man,<br/>leaks fluid, smells stale,
Makes weird noises out the back.
(laughing):<br/>Yeah, he does.
Hey, light up those cigars<br/>in the glove compartment.
They're real cubans.
I got 'em in chinatown<br/>last year just for this moment.
Uh, marshall, I'm not saying<br/>you were definitely ripped off,
But, um, these are chopsticks<br/>wrapped in napkins.
What are you talking about?<br/>Whoa,
Pothole.<br/>What? No.
(rumbling)<br/>whoa. No.
No, no,<br/>n-n-n-no.
No, there's only<br/>.8 miles to go.
Come on, buddy.
Buddy!
(engine stops running)
Is it cool<br/>if I still light these?
Ted:<br/>Kids, sometimes life forces us
To be someone<br/>we didn't want to be.
When that happens,<br/>we often try to hold on
To a little piece<br/>of who we were.
Maybe a tattoo.
Or a piece of jewelry.
A tiny souvenir that reminds us,
"this is who I really am."
Marshall's souvenir<br/>was not so tiny,
But the more he found himself
Being pushed<br/>toward the corporate world
And away from his dream<br/>of saving the environment,
The tighter he held on<br/>to that fiero.
Hey.
One good thing:<br/>We're off the hook
For the folding party today.<br/>Hey.
It's very important<br/>to both lily and me
That there be<br/>a handmade origami crane
In each of our wedding's...
(laughing):<br/>150...
I couldn't even get<br/>through it. Thank god.
Hey, your car's going<br/>to be fine.
This is the best<br/>auto shop around.
Look at this certificate.
One of the mechanics here<br/>finished a 64-ounce steak.
We felt bad<br/>that you guys were missing
The super-fun<br/>origami folding party,
So we suggested moving it here.
We insisted.
Terrific.<br/>(mutters)
How's the fiero?
She's still in triage.
She?
I thought it was<br/>your little boy.
Oh, it goes back and forth.
It's sort of a tranny car.
How long have you had her...<br/>Slash him?
My brothers handed it down<br/>to me when I was 16.
Oh, how nice of them.
Not really.
Congratulations.
The fiero is yours.
(laughs)
If you pass the final test.
Come on!
I already shaved my legs
And swallowed five dollars<br/>in quarters.
Only $4.50 has come out.
Just go to the<br/>weinerburger drive-thru
And get us 12 cups of coffee.
That's it?
Oh, yeah.

Agreed.
Totally agreed.

(groaning):<br/>Oh.

And that is the origin
Of marshall's insane "no food<br/>or drinks in the fiero",
"Not even groceries" rule.
It is not insane.<br/>Barney.
That's like the third one<br/>in a row that you've screwed up.
Well, I'm trying, but it's...<br/>I... Look.
You fold twice to the middle,<br/>fold back and forth,
Pull the ends out,<br/>flip over, open the flaps,
Fold the edges,<br/>crease the front,

Ah, the fiero-asco.
Dude, I told you<br/>that doesn't work.
It's the 100k fiasco.
What's the 100k fiasco?
The fiero-asco?
It was just before winter break
Our freshman year of college.
Marshall and I were roommates,
But we weren't<br/>really good friends yet.
I thought ted was a<br/>little bit pretentious.
And marshall was a total slob.
Hey.
Um... I'm<br/>driving
My fiero back over break.
I know we see enough<br/>of each other as it is,
But, uh, if you want a ride,<br/>I could use the gas money.
You live in ohio, right?
I could swing through<br/>and pick you up.
All right, first of all,<br/>my parents live in ohio.
I live in the moment.
Plus,
Karen and I haven't seen<br/>each other since thanksgiving.
I mean, we're both<br/>really invested
In making this<br/>long-distance thing work, so...
All right, well, call me<br/>if you change your mind.
My odometer's going to hit 100k.
(laughing):<br/>No.
She'd be so bummed<br/>if I left early.
It was totally mutual.

Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
Too late.
I'm taking this exit.
Who's not fun enough now, karen?
Marshall:<br/>Then we got lost.
Where the hell are we?!
No, keep driving.<br/>We're almost out of gas,
And we might not even<br/>be on a road anymore.
It's below zero out.
If we pull over, we could be<br/>snowed in for days.
Plus, I only have, like,
Six granola bars<br/>and three bottles of water.
Nah, I threw them out. What?!
No food or drink in the fiero.
No food or drink in the f...?

I just said you could<br/>cut me open and crawl inside me.
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff<br/>to me; it skeeves me out.
But... But you're dead,<br/>and I'm gonna die if I don't.

And even then,<br/>there's no guarantee.
Well, it's a pretty old car.
I mean, you can keep<br/>prolonging its life,
But it's really mostly<br/>machine at this point.
I know that it's a lot of money,
But it's my fiero.
You know?
I'm about to graduate and take<br/>some sellout corporate law job,
And without that fiero,<br/>I'm just another guy in a suit.
How dare you...
Hey.
I've been through<br/>so much in that car.
The suicidal cat.
(cat shrieking)
(loud bang)
Hitchhiking waldo.
The homeless guy
Who broke in through the window
And threw up all over<br/>the backseat.
(coughing) lily, don't.
Be strong. Do not go all<br/>"prisoner's dilemma" on me.
The car's on<br/>its deathbed, robin.
I have to clear my conscience.
Guys, what are you<br/>talking about?
Okay.
Shortly after we met robin,
She and I were jonesing for<br/>thai food from this one place.
An hour and a half delivery.
We can't wait that long.
I wish we could take the fiero,
But marshall has<br/>this insane no-food rule.
But thai food, lily.
Pad yum mao.
Tom kai gah.
Thai see ran.
Oh! You're just saying<br/>random syllables,
And it still sounds delicious.
Okay.
Here's what we'll do.
We'll drive over, pick it up,
Very carefully drive it<br/>back here with the windows open,
And he'll never know.
Wow, these brakes<br/>are really sensitive.
Oh, marshall is gonna kill me!
This and the difference between<br/>"affect" and "effect"
Are, like, the only two things<br/>he's really serious about.
Lily, it's gonna be fine.
No, it's not.<br/>Marshall's gonna freak.
Oh, god, oh, god.
What are we gonna do?<br/>Oh, god, oh...!
Shut up! Now,<br/>listen to me.
The clock is ticking.
Okay, first thing, we scoop up
All these little pieces<br/>of tofu and cabbage.
Next, what we need<br/>to take care of
Are the really messy parts...<br/>The pools that have collected.
We got to soak that soup up.
Last is the smell.<br/>We got to cover up
There's two in the glove<br/>compartment, but he's been
Saving them. Hand me<br/>those chopsticks.

Now it just smells like a<br/>homeless guy threw up in here.
The broken windows?
We had to make it<br/>look realistic.
Well, why did you break<br/>two of them?
Uh, it looked like<br/>fun when she did it.
So I wanted to try.
Can't believe this whole time<br/>it was you guys.
I've been blaming really tanned<br/>dancing leotard guy.
Marshall, I'm so sorry,<br/>but sharing that secret...
That's when robin and I<br/>became best friends.
Wow.
What a special car.
So, can I crush it<br/>into a little cube yet?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
Barney:<br/>Come on, marshall.

You know the right thing<br/>to do here.
Wow, barney, why do you<br/>love that car so much?
Love it?
Hold on a second.
Love it?
I hate it!
What? Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?!
Why?!
Let me tell it.
It was last year<br/>during the transit strike.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Uh, is marshall around?
I have a massage in queens<br/>in half an hour.
I need a ride.
Uh, no, he's at the library<br/>all day.
Just take the keys.
Uh... Hey!
Why don't you drive me?
It'll be like a total road trip.
To queens?
Yeah, we'll get,<br/>we'll get beef jerky, triscuits.
Uh, actually I have a lot<br/>of work to do, so...
Okay.
Well, anyway, I'll cancel.
See you later.<br/>Wait!
You know how to drive, right?
What...? Of course I know<br/>how to drive.
I love driving.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Hitting the road.
Cruising the lanes.
And braking.
Honking. Love it.
Except for lady drivers.
(chuckling): Don't get me<br/>started on lady drivers.
Which pedal's the gas?<br/>Trick question.
No, it's not.<br/>Yes, it is.
No, it's not.<br/>Middle, left, right?
I never learned how to drive!
I grew up in the city.
I never had a chance.
Well, guess what?<br/>You're getting your chance.
Because I'm going to teach you.
Barney stinson, buckle up.

This isn't right.
God never meant for us to travel
At such breakneck speeds.

Zitch dog. Yes!

Sometime in the next 20 minutes.<br/>Which?

Actually, he had two accidents,<br/>if you add the fact that he...
Hummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.
I shouldn't even be here,<br/>thanks to that deathtrap.
But fate...
Fate gave me a second chance.
And helped me realize
That our days on this planet<br/>are too few to squander.
So I decided from that moment on
To continue living life<br/>to its fullest.
So you made<br/>a life-changing decision
To not change your life at all.
True story.
Guys...
This fiero's meant a lot<br/>to all of us.
Friendships were made.
Adventures had.
Horrors faced.
That's why we have to get rid<br/>of it.
Yes!
What?<br/>What?
It's lived a great life and it<br/>deserves to die with dignity.
But 200,000...<br/>But
That's life. You know?
You never end up where you<br/>thought you wanted to be.
I'm not helping the environment.
Ted's not a philosopher.
Lily's not
A world-famous artist.
Barney's never driven
More than ten miles an hour.
I'm sure, has also experienced<br/>disappointment in her life.
Maybe?
And my fiero's not a fiero
That went 200,000 miles.
It's okay.
You know?
Those are old dreams.
We'll get a new car
And we'll fill that one up<br/>with new memories.
And that'll be the car we had
When we were first married.
When we owned
Our first house.
Maybe even the first car<br/>our four kids remember.
Oh, that's so sweet.
The first car<br/>our two kids remember.
Um, I would like<br/>to say good-bye.
(machinery humming)
(sighs)
(tape ejects)
Oh.
(sighs)
You know what?
This fiero, it's effected<br/>all our lives.
Affected.<br/>That's what I said.
Just making sure.
Got us all a lot of places.
I mean maybe it's time<br/>we return the favor.
This fiero should have<br/>made it to 200,000.
So, let's get it out that door.
And we'll push it<br/>the last .7 miles.
It'd do
The same for us.
(triumphant<br/>musical theme playing)
(music stops) hey, geniuses.
The back wheels are on blocks.
That car ain't going anywhere.
Close enough!
All:<br/>Close enough!
And so marshall said good-bye<br/>to his fiero.
And as the car's final gift<br/>to us all,
The money he got for scrap<br/>parts paid our bar tab
For the next two nights.
Arrivederci, fiero!
You were the freaking<br/>giving tree of cars.
Aw, may you rust in peace.
Rot in hell, devil steed.
(bottles clink)
And what better friend is there<br/>than that?
Hey, man.<br/>Bro.

And all your colorful<br/>sweaters in this box
Marked "bill cosby."

It's called the "are you ready<br/>to move in together?" quiz.
Well, if it's anything<br/>like you're
"are you wearing panties" quiz,<br/>I'm out.

Question one,
Ted, "do you want to<br/>move in with robin?"
Mm. Yes.
Oh, you got the first one wrong.
The answer is "no",
"you secretly want to be single
And hang out with<br/>your awesome friend barney."
Question two, robin.
"Do you think you can score<br/>a hotter guy than ted?"
Correct. The answer was<br/>awkward silence.
Question three,
"did I just make up this quiz<br/>to prove a point?"
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Really?<br/>You mean
It's not from<br/>old yellow legal pad magazine?
(chuckles)
So? We all agree?
We move ted's stuff<br/>back up here?
Mm... No. We're still<br/>moving in together.
Why?
This is crazy.
Ted you're throwing<br/>your life away.
This girl is blinding you.
With her shiny hair<br/>and her boobed shaped boobs.
This is bad<br/>for you, too, you know.
How are you going to feel
When he sees you<br/>without any makeup?
I'm not wearing makeup<br/>right now.
Holy crap, you're beautiful.
All right then,<br/>how will you feel
When you can't sneak<br/>the occasional cigarette?
Oh, come on,<br/>robin doesn't smoke.
Wait, do you?<br/>Of course not.
Why?
Don't tell me how<br/>to live my life!
Ted, I can't let you do this.
Come on.
This is happening.
So instead of fighting it<br/>why, why don't you just help?
You want me to help you?
Yeah.
Okay, ted.
I'll help you.
Can't believe we actually<br/>got him to take a box down.
Mm.<br/>Maybe he's
Finally getting on board.

Where's barney?
Wait for it.
I can't believe this!
Everything I own in<br/>the world is in there.
Except for this box of pot lids.
And the sword.
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to god I'm<br/>going to kill him!
Right. Maybe I'll just<br/>hold on to that.
For now.
Marshall, we live alone.
This is so great!
We can finally do all the things
We always said we wanted<br/>to do if we lived alone.
Oh, I know what I want<br/>to start with.
So, here we are, right?
Sitting around<br/>the apartment naked.
Awesome.<br/>Yep.
It's not as awesome as<br/>I thought it would be.
My butt itches.
I'm cold.<br/>I noticed.
Yeah, like you're one<br/>to talk, pointy.
Barney, I don't know if you got<br/>my other 47 messages,
But if my stuff isn't here<br/>within the hour
I'm calling the cops.
This is the last time<br/>I'm calling you.
Because my charger's<br/>in the back of the truck.
Don't worry, it's barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.
No, it's just...
I was really looking forward
To settling in, you know?
Maybe setting up my tv.
Watching a movie in bed.
(inhales sharply)
What?
Do we really want a tv<br/>in the bedroom?
I thought we did.
I'm not sure that we do.
Well, where else would<br/>we put my tv?
We could just put it<br/>in our storage unit
In the basement.
But wouldn't we miss my tv?
Would we?
Yes, we would.
We've had that tv<br/>for a long time
And we would feel more at home
If it were setup in our bedroom.
We need wine, don't we?
Yes, we do.
(cork pops)
(moaning)
Should we, um, move<br/>this to the bedroom?
Why?
Ted doesn't live here anymore.
We can do it wherever we want.
You know what else?<br/>Hmm?
We don't have<br/>to be quiet anymore.
We can be as loud as we want.
(giggles) (moans)
Okay, I think we need
To lay down some ground rules.
Just because we can be loud<br/>doesn't mean we have to be loud.
And although<br/>it might turn you on,
You screaming, "I'm the best,"<br/>doesn't do much for me.
Well, it's a lot better<br/>than yelling,
"ted's not here,"<br/>over and over again.
Well, at least<br/>what I said is true.
Well, that was unnecessary.
Well, since I only have one box
I figure I might as<br/>well unpack it.
Mm, where do you think<br/>we should put it?
Well, unless you have<br/>a separate pot lid room,
I was thinking the cupboard.
(inhales sharply) what?
Uh, the thing is my kitchen<br/>is kind of small.
And, um, I already have<br/>a bunch of pot lids
And mine come with pots, so...
You're saying<br/>there's no way to make room
For the single box of stuff<br/>I try to move into our place?
Well, why don't you just<br/>take it down to the...
Do not say storage space.
I was going to say dumpster.
Damn it, robin,<br/>this is all I have left
In the world... eight<br/>pot lids and a sword.
Yeah, about the sword.
(cell phone rings)
Hello.
(in deep voice):<br/>Put on the suit, mr. Mosby.
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?
It's not me.
If you want to see
Your precious possessions again,<br/>put on the suit.
What suit?<br/>Ding-dong.
Oh, what's that? The doorbell.
That's the suit<br/>I'm talking about.
I haven't gotten<br/>to the door yet.
Oh, okay, let me know<br/>when you get there.
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.
That's the suit<br/>I'm talking about.
Barney...<br/>This isn't barney.
But I hear that guy's awesome.
All right.
Listen very carefully.
You will get your stuff back
If you are able to complete<br/>a series of challenges.
Number one,
Put on the suit.
Number two, meet me<br/>at mcclaren's in an hour.
How will I know who to look for<br/>since we've never met?
I look like barney.
Oh, hey, ted.
Suit and sneakers.
A little ellen degeneres<br/>but you pull it off.
I don't have any other shoes
Because you stole them along
With everything else I own<br/>in the world.
Where's the truck, barney?
Barney.
People's whose trucks<br/>I'm not holding for ransom
Call me barney.
I think you should call me<br/>the commodore.
I'm not calling you...
Then you're not getting<br/>your stuff back.
Can I please have<br/>my stuff back...
The commodore?
(giggles):<br/>No.
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.
And you're about to become<br/>a henpecked,
Beaten down, shell of a man.
So tonight,
We are going to have
One last awesome night<br/>together as bros.
It's a bro-ing away party.
A special bro-casion.
A bro-choice rally.
Bro-time at the apollo.
Oh, bro me.
Well, so what do I have to do?
No, it's not<br/>what you have to do,
It's what you want to do,<br/>and you want to have a good time
Before you go take fun ted<br/>out back and shoot him.
So...
First thing on the docket...
Get me that girl's number.<br/>Absolutely not.
Mm. That's too bad.
Hey, hypothetical question:
If I was all your stuff,<br/>would I rather be
At the bottom of the east river<br/>or the hudson?
Hey, look,<br/>world's strongest man is on.
Ooh, it's the one
Where lou ferrigno pulls the bus
From the partridge family<br/>with his teeth.
It's the best one.
Hey, ted, get in...
We live alone.
(softly):<br/>Yay.
Well, I win.
You need to give my<br/>friend your phone number.
Wow, I really
Didn't think lou ferrigno<br/>could pull that bus.
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.
Yeah, that's 'cause<br/>the, uh, tv is old.
Oh. Oh.
So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?
Yeah. Um, not too early.<br/>I have church.
You were impressive, buddy.
Nice work. All right,<br/>next challenge.
No. No next challenge.
Look, this is my first<br/>night living with robin.
She's probably pissed I'm<br/>spending it out with you.
This might be our last hurrah,<br/>my little friend.
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
The best dinner of your life.
How would you like a...
One-egg omelet with some<br/>ketchup and film?
Guess ted's the one<br/>who did the shopping.
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!
Guess the microwave<br/>was ted's, too.
Yeah.
(shivering):<br/>So were all the towels.
Turns out that<br/>everything that was useful
In this apartment was ted's.
Everything that was
A foghat poster we bought<br/>ironically in college was mine.
Marshall.
Yeah, baby?
I miss ted.
Is it too soon to call him?
No, we shouldn't.
I don't want to interrupt his<br/>first night living with robin.
(electronic laser blasting)
Ha, nice shooting.
You know, if we win this one
It's free onion rings at the<br/>intergalactic snack shack.
Oh, what a bargain.
We only had to spend<br/>20 bucks a game.
Admit it, you're having fun.
Ah, maybe.
I mean, it was pretty funny<br/>when that little girl
Fell over that space barrel.<br/>(both laughing)
(shouting)
Nice...
We win.
Oh, walk of shame,
Walk of game... what up?
Okay. Let's go one more.
I don't know.<br/>You know you want to.
All right, let's do it... I just<br/>got to call robin real quick.
Oh, so that's what it's<br/>gonna be like from now on?
No. Okay, okay.<br/>You call your old lady
And ask permission to have fun.
Me, I will be at the snack shack
Eating our victory<br/>onion rings han style.
Solo.
Hey, ted.
Hey, sweetie listen,<br/>I'm really sorry
But I'm gonna be pretty late,<br/>so don't wait up.
Oh, it's totally fine.<br/>You do what you got to do.
Thanks. You're the best.<br/>I love you.
I love you, too. Bye.
Hey, sorry about that.<br/>Thanks for holding.
Um, so if you could go ahead<br/>and cancel my subscription
To guns and ammo,<br/>that would be great.
No, it's a great magazine.<br/>Really great.
They've printed<br/>three of my letters.
It's just that my boyfriend<br/>is moving in
And he kind of doesn't approve<br/>of the whole gun thing.
A free hand grenade phone?
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.
I did it, baby!
I got beer.
I got food.<br/>(door closes)
We don't need ted anymore.
I am the provider<br/>of this apartment now,
And I have provided!
"Provode"? Provided.
Anyway, I got us<br/>everything we need.
Could you toss me<br/>the toilet paper?
Be right back, baby.<br/>Sit tight.
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think<br/>I would, but, uh...
I had a really<br/>good time tonight.
You're a good friend, barney.
(clinking)
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...
Why don't you tell me<br/>where my truck is.
No, I don't think so.
Where's my truck?!
Do you know why
I haven't given you any of<br/>your possessions back yet?
Uh, because you're admiral jerk<br/>of the british royal douchery?
Because you don't<br/>want them back.
Oh. You could've left<br/>at any time tonight
But you didn't, ted.<br/>Why is that?
Because I didn't want to go back<br/>to robin's without my stuff.
False. You know<br/>what I think?
I think you spent<br/>one day with her
And it already sucked.
I think you didn't<br/>like being there,
She didn't like having you there
And you both realized
That you made a huge mistake.
And that's why
You spent your first<br/>night living with robin
Out playing laser tag with me.
And that's why three seconds ago
You didn't call it "my place"
Or "our place" or "home,"
You called it "robin's."
You know what?
You can keep my stuff.
Hey. Hey, did you<br/>get the truck back?
No.<br/>Why not? What happened?
Oh, he pissed me<br/>off so much, I left.
Anyway,
I just wanted to come<br/>back here, space out
And watch a movie.
Do you anything<br/>that wasn't made by john woo?
Why, do you?
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.
(sighing)
(inhales sharply)
What?
It's just I eat at that table.
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.<br/>(inhales sharply)
You know, why don't you just<br/>throw me down
In the storage space<br/>where you have room for me.
Ted, come on.<br/>No, you come on.
I had to jump through hoops<br/>all night for barney
And then it took me<br/>an hour to get home
Because his place<br/>is so far away from the bar.
Oh, my god.<br/>What?
I know where barney<br/>put my truck.
Mm.
Let's go back to my place.
I bet you my place is closer.
Here we are.
You live in the loading dock
Behind the bar?
I don't live here, baby.<br/>This is just my ride.
No, no, no, no.<br/>I'm not getting into any van,
I've seen silence of the lambs.
(slow r&amp;b music plays)
Oh, my god.
We're drinking champagne<br/>in the back of a moving van.
Why, yes, sara. Yes, we are.
Those other rockettes
Who called you slow are crazy.
(engine starts)
Oh, my god. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me. Help!
No, no, no, no.<br/>Help!
I can explain.
(cell phone chimes)
Hello?
(sinister voice):<br/>Enjoying the ride?
Ted? Ted, you let us<br/>out of here.
You let us out<br/>of here this instant!
This isn't ted.
But I hear that guy's awesome.
(phone snaps shut)
So I took sara home
And I took barney to a bar<br/>near his apartment.
Apparently, that strategy<br/>had never occurred to him.
That poor girl must've<br/>been so confused. Yeah.
Well, at least barney<br/>learned a valuable lesson.
You do not want to get scissor<br/>kicked in the groin by a rockette.
So, uh, I guess we<br/>should get you unpacked.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Lily...
Deep within<br/>the amazonian rainforest,
There is a type<br/>of tree that only grows
Around the body<br/>of an existing tree.
It cannot survive<br/>without this tree.
It is supported...<br/>By this tree.
Lily, we are that tree.
The inside tree or<br/>the outside tree?
The outside tree.
Shouldn't there be three trees?
You and I are one tree.<br/>Okay, look, lily,
The point is that<br/>we grew around ted
And without him,<br/>we're slowly dying.
What do we do?
I think we can marry each other.
But we also have to marry ted.
I'll tell you right now, my dad
Is not gonna pay<br/>for that wedding.
Ted!<br/>What are you doing here?
Robin and I aren't gonna<br/>move in together after all.
What happened?
I thought we decided we were ready?<br/>I know.
How did we come to that again?
I don't remember.
We were fighting?
It's all so blurry.<br/>Yeah.
The "let's move in together" sex
Was pretty amazing.<br/>I know.
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.<br/>Mm-hmm.
You know...
I'm really happy with you.
I really happy with you.<br/>The way things are.
Yeah. Maybe we<br/>shouldn't mess with that.
I don't know that we should.
Hey...
I hear the "let's not<br/>move in together" sex
Is pretty incredible.
Let's go back to my place.
Mm...
Thank you.<br/>You're welcome.
No, thank you.<br/>You'll be very happy.
Uh, look, I-I know you<br/>guys are really excited
About having the<br/>place to yourself.
Until after the wedding,<br/>I mean, if it's not
Too much of an imposition...
Um...<br/>God, this feels so right.
Mm...<br/>Never leave us again.
Guys, robin's down in the truck<br/>and there's actually
A lot of boxes,<br/>so maybe we should...
Shh...
Do we have time for this?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have in my hand a copy<br/>of tonight's top ten list.
The category: Top ten things<br/>I would've called my truck...
It was never your truck.
If ted hadn't been a jerk
And given it back.
It was a rental.
Number ten,
"the winne-bango."
Number nine,<br/>"the pick-up truck."
Number eight,<br/>"the ford explore her."
Number seven,<br/>"the you scream truck."
You scream.
(all laughing)
Number six,<br/>"feels on wheels." hello!
Number five,<br/>"the ride her truck."
Number four, "the 18-squeeler."
(laughing)
Number three, "the esca-laid."
(chuckles)
Number two, "the slam-boney."
And...
The number one thing<br/>I would've called my truck
If ted hadn't been a jerk<br/>and given it back...
(table drumroll)
"the '69 chevy."
(scatting theme song)
(glass breaking)
Sorry.
(scatting)
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: It took me a<br/>while to figure out,
But the key to understanding<br/>your uncle barney is this.
When times are hard, it's<br/>impossible to keep him around.
Like when your aunt lily and<br/>uncle marshall were broken up.
Hey.
What are you guys talking about?
Lily.
I got to go.
But when times are good, it's<br/>impossible to get rid of him.
What are you guys doing?
We just finished planning<br/>marshall's bachelor party.
Good, you haven't started yet.
Let's talk logistics.
Now, have you laid out<br/>ground rules with lily?
Where you are or aren't allowed
To touch or be touched?
Show me on ted.
Actually, we're, uh,
We're thinking<br/>of skipping the strippers.
You... You want to have a party
Mmm.<br/>Without strippers.
This was the worst thing<br/>I could have said.
You see, barney loved<br/>cooking up bachelor parties,
And it was always<br/>the same recipe.
You start with a slightly<br/>cramped hotel suite.
Arrange the chairs<br/>in a circle...
Fill them<br/>with your closest friends.
Turn the heat up to about 90.
Pump in a metric ton<br/>of cigar smoke.
And then, right in the middle<br/>of the room,
You throw in a girl.
But not a beautiful girl...
No, if this girl<br/>was ever beautiful,
It was two kids, three tattoos,
And one pesky<br/>substance abuse problem ago.
Which one of you is stuart?
Please, I really don't want<br/>to do this.
Shut up.<br/>Put in your mouth guard.
(spanking) ted: Then she<br/>proceeds to do things
(stuart moaning)<br/>that demean the groom,
Herself and really,<br/>the entire human race.
Disgusting.
Ah, horrifying.
Classic.
Stuart: Oh, please,<br/>please, no, no.
I don't want anything<br/>like that happening to me.
Stuart's still trying<br/>to forget that night.
It's my bachelor party.
We're not having strippers.
Oh, he thinks he<br/>has a say in it.
So, strippers it is!
Now, just, uh,
Tell me where we're going to be
And I'll make some calls.
I think I can get the<br/>fourth one for free.
Quick question.
Prosthetic arm.<br/>Deal breaker?
Barney, there is...
Before you say no,<br/>it has attachments.
Look, I know you have<br/>some stuff planned
For marshall's bachelor party,
But he really doesn't want<br/>strippers.
Yes, he does.
Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.
Uh, well, he told me he does.
When?
Every minute of every day
As his inner animal thrashes<br/>against the cage
Of his own puritanical<br/>upbringing.
Or do you guys not like<br/>naked girls?
Um, we love naked girls.
They're one of the
Best things in the world.
It goes...
Naked girls, democracy,
The scene<br/>in every which way but loose
Where the monkey gives<br/>a guy the finger.
Mm.
We just don't like<br/>your naked girls.
What,<br/>my girls aren't hot enough?
I mean, all right, fine,
The stripper at stuart's<br/>bachelor party was a 15.
She was 15?
No, a 15.
Like in blackjack.
As in, not sure<br/>whether you'd hit it?
Exactly.
Nice.
This is important to marshall.
So, promise me, no strippers.
All right, I promise.
I'm serious.
So am I.
No strippers.
Now say it without winking.
No strippers.
You just winked.
No, I didn't.
So, when the day arrived,
We all climbed into a rented<br/>escalade and set out.
Now, every bachelor party<br/>is usually made up
Of the same stock characters.
You've got the groom...
The best man...
The guy who speaks only<br/>in clichés...
Dead man walking!
The guy who disappears<br/>at the beginning of the night
And doesn't show up again<br/>until the end.
All right,
Who's up for a little blackjack<br/>before we check in?
No, no, no. Mm-mmm. None for me.
See you guys back<br/>at the room, then.
And, of course, well...
Barney.
Every bachelor party<br/>has a barney.
Oh, what's this?
This car has a dvd player?
You mean,<br/>we could have been watching
These pornos the whole time?
Yeah.<br/>This one's in hd.
This one's in h-double-d.
Oh!
That same night, aunt lily
Was having a wedding shower,
And robin showed up,<br/>gift in hand.
Funny story about that gift.
Hey, barney,
Check out what I got lily<br/>for her shower.
It's kind of racy.
Think you can handle it?
Uh, I've been<br/>in a ten-way.
So, yeah.
It's kind of see-through.
Hmm?<br/>Whoa-ho-ho!
You weren't kidding!
You know when you should<br/>give that to her?
1850.
Robin, it's her bridal shower!
All her friends<br/>are gonna be there.
They're going to be drinking.
You need to get her<br/>something daring,
Something outrageous.
Well, what do you think<br/>I should get her?
There's a store on eighth avenue
That specializes in...
How to put this delicately?...
Uh, battery-powered, adult-<br/>recreational fake penises.
(giggling)
And so aunt robin went<br/>to a store on eighth avenue,
And bought a battery-powered,<br/>adult-recreational...
Well, it was something<br/>inappropriate.
And we're back in.
Robin!<br/>Oh.
Ohh,
I'm so glad you're here. Hey.
Come in, I want you<br/>to meet everybody.
Robin, this is my grandma lois
And my aunt oh.
Florence. Oh,<br/>lovely to meet you,
Dear.<br/>Florence.
They put this whole party<br/>together.
Oh!
It's different from<br/>what I expected,
But lovely. Lovely.
And, oh, look,
There are little kids here!
Yeah, my cousins.
Listen, I, uh, I forgot<br/>something somewhere
So I'm going to just go...
Robin, this is my mom, janice.
Oh.<br/>Oh, honey,
Oh. I'm so glad to<br/>finally meet you.
Me too. I, I've heard<br/>so much about you.
Me, too. Oh, here.
Oh, um... Let me take your gift.
Oh...
Can I guess what it is?
Is it a, a, a mini<br/>food processor?
No.
No? Oh.
Oh, give me a hint.<br/>What color is it?
Black.
Well, I guess I'm just going
To have to wait and see!
Oh, great.
Robin, um...
This is my cousin margaret.
Oh, finally, someone<br/>our own age!
(giggling) lily: Wait,
Do I introduce you<br/>as "cousin margaret"
Or "sister margaret?"
Well, I'm not officially<br/>confirmed as a nun
Until next month
And I don't want to tick off
The big guy,
So let's stick
With "cousin" for now.
(chuckling)
God's watching.
Excellent!
Man, they spent a lot<br/>of money on this porno.
Whoa... morgan freeman?
Man, that guy's<br/>in everything everything.
Aw, man, I grabbed<br/>the wrong deep impact!
No, leave it in.<br/>It's a good movie.
But, dude, there's no sex in it.
Yeah, just like marriage.
Huh? Right?
Oh, oh, hey,
Check this out!<br/>Don't ask how,
But I procured for us<br/>five loco-bueno,
Hand-rolled,<br/>highly illegal cubans.
Seriously, you could go to jail
For smoking these things.
Marriage is like jail!
Right, fellas?!
But at least in jail,<br/>you get to have sex!
But we're not lighting<br/>these babies up
Till we get<br/>to the a.C.
A.C.?
Um, atlantic city.
Try to keep up, brad.
We're not going<br/>to atlantic city.
Just a second, brad.
Hi.
Hi.<br/>Um...
We're still going<br/>to atlantic city, right?
Oh, did I not tell you?
Yeah, we switched it.<br/>We're going to foxwoods.
Foxwoods?
But I've got an ipperstray<br/>waiting in tlanticaay itycay.
What the heck's in foxwoods?
Well, we've got five<br/>third row seats
To the popinski-salazar<br/>rematch.
They've set aside our<br/>very own craps table,
And I reserved a<br/>private room for us
At connelly's,<br/>where the five of us are going
To be sharing a 102-ounce steak
From a cow that I picked out<br/>on the internet.
Yeah.<br/>Great.
The night's ruined.
Sorry, barney.
It was an honest mistake.
Marshall:<br/>This is going to be great!
Meat, violence,
Throwing money down the toilet.
America: 1;<br/>every other country: 0.
(chuckling) thanks, guys.
Yeah.
You okay, barney?
What can I say, ted?
You won.
Hi.
You one...
Sad, pathetic loser.
Boys, say hello to treasure.
Boys:<br/>Hi, treasure.
I can't believe<br/>that you did this.
I had to.<br/>I'm your best man.
Ted's my best man.
You've yet to make a<br/>decision and that's fine.
But as your<br/>best-man-to-be,
It's my job to make sure<br/>at your bachelor party
You see a woman<br/>take her clothes off
While dancing to whitesnake's<br/>"here I go again."
(sighs)
All right, fine, but...
Let's make it fast, all right.
The fight starts in an hour.<br/>We don't want to miss it.
It's a girl taking<br/>her clothes off.
How long can it take?
It's a bit more complicated<br/>than that.
I need two grounded sockets,
A large sterile pot filled<br/>with hot water
And you all need<br/>to sign these releases.
An egg beater!<br/>(sighs)
Aw, thank you, aunt sylvia!
I love that it's cordless.
Well, at least I got<br/>that part right.
All of these gifts are<br/>so thoughtful.
Robin:<br/>Lily?
I need you to look at me<br/>right now and read my mind.
Oh, my god!<br/>You're hearing me!
Lily:<br/>Yeah!
Sorry this party's so boring.
What's up?
Do not open my gift.
See what I'm doing here?
I'm looking over at the gift,
Then back at you,
And I'm shaking my head, "no."
Gift.
You.
No.
Are you getting that?
I totally got it.
(under her breath):<br/>Okay.
Hmm?
Oh!
Here you go.
Lily said it was your time<br/>of the month.
You're welcome.
(sighs)
What are you doing?
Oh, just, um...
Rearranging the gifts.
The pile looked<br/>a bit precarious.
So...
Oh, don't worry.<br/>I'll keep an eye on it.
Great.
You do that.
You're gonna make<br/>a damn good nun.
Ted: As many times as robin<br/>told this story over the years,
She would never quite be able
To explain the logic<br/>of her next move.
(music playing)
Is this a strip show<br/>or a kiss concert?
Shh!
She's starting.
Please turn off<br/>your cell phones, pagers
And sense of shame.
All right, boys.
Lie back,
Get comfortable,<br/>and enjoy the show.
Of course there's no way I'm going<br/>to tell you about her show.
So, let's skip ahead a little.
Ow!
Oh, my god, are you all right?
No, I am not all right,<br/>you idiot.
My ankle is broken!
Take me to the hospital!
Um, actually, we have tickets.
(sobbing)
You know what?
Thanks a lot, barney.
She told you at the beginning<br/>of the show
Not to use the smoke machine<br/>when she's on the hippity hop.
Now I'm going<br/>to have to spend the rest
Of my bachelor party<br/>in a hospital.
Well, hey, maybe<br/>we'll get to see her x-rays.
The ultimate strip show.
X-rays. More like<br/>triple x-rays.
Just stop.
Which exit's the hospital?
What if she doesn't make<br/>it to the hospital?
Barney, please calm down.
Maybe we should just<br/>take her to the desert,
Bury her and wash our hands<br/>of this whole thing!
Dude, what is the matter<br/>with you?
I'm just trying to illustrate to<br/>marshall that as his best man...
You're not my best man.<br/>As his best man,
I would help him bury a hooker<br/>in the desert.
I'm not a hooker.
And you're not my best man.
You've ruined my bachelor party.
I don't know why<br/>you wouldn't just listen to me
When I said I didn't want this.
Well, the fight started<br/>ten minutes ago.
Maybe-maybe we should listen.
Radio announcer:<br/>Oh, doctor, what a fight!
That knockout will be<br/>talked about for years to come!
Anyone lucky enough<br/>to be in the arena tonight
Just witnessed boxing history<br/>in the making!
Thank you so much, margaret.
I can't believe you carved<br/>that crucifix yourself.
So talented.
Didn't think you could carve.
For you.
Oh. And this one's from...
Grandma lois.
Grandma lois:<br/>Oh. No, wait, darling.
Before you open this, I-I<br/>want to say a few words.
Ted: Okay, something<br/>you need to know.
Grandma lois thought she was<br/>giving her granddaughter
An antique sewing machine.
And we're back in.
Honey,
This handy little<br/>device has been
In our family for generations.
I used it.<br/>Your great grandmother used it.
Now,
Her mother didn't use this one,
But she used one just like it.
Of course, back then,<br/>they were made out of wood.
And, uh, I guess before that,
You just had to do it by hand.
Would you pass the wine, please?
No.
Hey, marshall,
While we're here,<br/>you may as well go down
To the morgue<br/>and climb into a drawer,
'cause that's<br/>what marriage is like.
Can I get an amen?
(chuckling)
Is everything all right<br/>at home, stuart?
No.
(sighs)
It's broken.
Oh, damn it.<br/>This is bad.
I really can't lose this job.
My daughters are<br/>about to start school,
And my fiancé, well...
Ever since he got<br/>back from iraq,
Pretty much all<br/>he does is drink.
I think about leaving him,
But I don't want my girls<br/>growing up without a dad
Like I did.
I don't want them to<br/>know what that's like.
So, show time?
What is the matter with you?
Her ankle's broken.
I know for a fact
That the second half<br/>of her act takes place largely
In a seated or supine position.
Oh, that's true.
Treasure, please,<br/>don't worry about the show.
Uh, we'd feel bad.
What does that mean?
No. We just mean, uh,<br/>you're off the hook.
You don't have to do it.
I don't have to do it?<br/>Well, guess what?
I know I don't have to do it.
I do it because I am good at it.
Look, I don't need your pity.
All I want to do is<br/>give you a great show
Because you're getting married!
Is that so much to ask?
Is that such a major<br/>inconvenience?!
(instrumental rock music plays)
Oh. Wow.
Oh, that is wrong.
Oh, that's just so wrong.
Well, the doctor did say<br/>for her to keep it elevated.
(hissing)
When I was a girl,
My mother taught me<br/>and my sister to use it.
We used to have contests<br/>to see who could finish faster.
It was so exciting.
The whole family<br/>would gather around to watch.
And when I was a new bride,
This is what kept me busy<br/>all those long nights
When your grandfather<br/>was in korea.
Oh.
Grandma lois:<br/>And speaking
Of your grandpa,
Though I don't think<br/>he'd care to admit this
To any of his army buddies, but
He'd have a go at it<br/>every once in a while.
And he enjoyed it.
(laughs)
Oh,
Open it up, sweetie.
May this give for you<br/>as much joy as it's brought me.
Oh, thank you.
(lily laughs quietly)
Grandma, um...
Wow.
Well, take it out, honey.
I want to show you<br/>how to use it.
Robin:<br/>Okay, no, no!
Don't take it out.
Lily, that's not<br/>your grandma's gift.
It's mine.
I panicked, and I switched
The cards because<br/>I was embarrassed.
Well, what is it?
(sighs)
It's just like the one<br/>miranda gave to charlotte
On sex and the city.
Oh, I love that show.
I always watch it on tbs.
Janice:<br/>Oh, you would.
You're such a samantha!
Oh, I'm a carrie!<br/>You're a samantha!
(laughter)
Ted:<br/>And then the night became
A whole new kind<br/>of uncomfortable.
So where do I get one of these?
Mom!
Man, what a show, huh?
She did some disgusting stuff.
Really sticks with you.
I may be done eating.
Me, too.
I mean, like, forever.
Me, too.
I miss my wife.
Barney:<br/>Hey,
Let's go around the table
And say what our<br/>favorite part was.
Mine was that thing<br/>with the typewriter.
I mean,
She made some spelling mistakes,<br/>but still.
Ooh, and you guys were all,
"barney, put out the cigar!
It's a non-smoking room!"
And I was all,<br/>"hell, no, this is a cuban!"
(giggles)
Of course, eventually,<br/>I did put it out.
Did I put it out?
I put it out.
Did I put it out?
I put it out.
(distant siren blaring)
Did I put it out?
Ted:<br/>It was a small fire,
Not even big enough to force<br/>an evacuation of the hotel,
But definitely big enough<br/>to get us kicked out,
And bring marshall's<br/>bachelor party to an early end.
Is that...?
It is.
Hey, guys.
How was the fight?
Hey, what are you<br/>guys doing here?
What happened to<br/>the bachelor party?
We missed the fight,<br/>dinner was ruined,
We spent half the night<br/>in the hospital,
And got kicked out of the hotel.
What do you think happened?<br/>Lily: Barney.
Barney.
Hey, I was just trying<br/>to be a good best man.
You know what<br/>a best man does, barney?
He does what the groom wants.
But all you ever think about<br/>is what you want,
What's best for you.
Best man? I'm not even sure
I'm inviting you<br/>to the wedding at this point.
You don't mean that.
Why should I invite you?
You don't even want us<br/>to get married.
(laughs)
That's not true.
Lily, don't.
What?
I'm sorry, barney.
It happened last summer<br/>when we were broken up.
Hey, what are you guys<br/>talking about?
Lily.
Ah, I got to go.
♪
Newark airport, please.
(knocking)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "barney,<br/>what are you doing here?"
"I can't believe<br/>it's really you.
"Come in, have a seat.<br/>Do you want some tea?
"I know the apartment's small,<br/>but I don't need much space.
"Let me show you some<br/>of my paintings.
"I think it's some of my best<br/>work ever." just stop it.
Lily, you have to come home.
You and marshall<br/>belong together.
The two of you have something
That most people search their<br/>whole lives for and never find.
I know you love him,<br/>and if you knew
What he was going through<br/>right now,
You wouldn't be here<br/>for one more second.
I bought you a ticket home.
Marshall is one<br/>of the best people I know,
And it won't be long until<br/>someone else realizes that,
And you'll lose him forever.
I can't stand the thought<br/>of that happening,
And I cannot keep stealing<br/>chicks from him forever.
Never, ever tell anyone<br/>I was here.
I will deny it tooth and nail.
This trip never happened.
Hey, if you had three hours<br/>to kill before your flight,
What would you do...<br/>Alcatraz or fisherman's wharf?
You really did that?
Ted:<br/>Marshall,
I think barney's your best man.
Yeah.
Yes, he is.
See, lily?<br/>This is why I didn't...
Really?
Really.
Real... In your face, loser!
(silly laugh)
Take it easy, all right.
Ted's still my best man, too.
You guys are co-best men.
(laughs) barney: Right.
Yes, we're both best man.
No, um, seriously.
You guys are co-best men.
Of course.
(mumbling)
Oh, I'm saying, I'm agreeing<br/>we'll both be best men.
I can't believe you got me this.
Oh, I only did it as a joke.
I can return it<br/>for you if you want.
Oh, no, it's okay.
You don't have to go all the way<br/>back down there.
I'll, I'll just throw it away.
Well, I mean, if you're<br/>going to throw it away,
Maybe I'll take it<br/>in case I get invited
To another wedding shower.
It's a great gag gift.
Yeah, it's really funny.<br/>(laughs)
You know who would get a kick<br/>out of it? Marshall.
So, so maybe<br/>I'll just hold on to it.
I would be embarrassed
If marshall found out<br/>that I bought it for you,
So I'd better just take it.
Robin, leave it.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: In the weeks leading up to aunt<br/>lily and uncle marshall's wedding,
Some weird stuff<br/>started happening.
Why does my stomach hurt?
I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch<br/>of ice cream earlier today.
Oh, baby, you know<br/>we're lactose-intolerant.
Wait, wait, wait,<br/>wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you suggesting that
When one of you feels something,<br/>the other feels it, too?
Barney:<br/>Oh, god,
You guys are so codependent.
No, we're not.
Oh, really?
What about the other day?
Oh, I need to get some eggs.
Oh, I'll come with you.
Just because we like<br/>spending time together
Doesn't mean we're codependent.
Really?
Then whatever happened<br/>to your plan of spending
The last two weeks before<br/>your wedding sleeping apart?
Okay, we decided
Not to do that because of...
Logistics.
Wedding logistics.
Frickin' logistics, man.
They mess everything up.
You didn't do it<br/>because you couldn't do it.
Sure we could.
Then why don't you?
You can stay with me.
It would make our wedding<br/>night more special.
Okay, let's do it.
Done.
I'm gonna go grab a beer.
I'll come with you.
No. I'll stay.
Okay, I know. You know<br/>what? I got to go.
Good-bye.
My mom's driving me cra...
God, you guys are
Covered in sauce.
We'll get to that.<br/>Me first.
My mom is driving me crazy<br/>about the wedding music.
The woman takes
One cruise to jamaica,
And suddenly, it's "not a party<br/>without steel drums."
Doesn't everybody know you're<br/>not supposed to stress out
A bride right<br/>before her wedding?!
Okay, sauce, go.
Long story.
I'll tell you later.<br/>Yeah.
It's a dirty story, isn't it?
You guys went out to dinner,
Did it in the kitchen<br/>and got caught.
Scherbatsky reeks of someone<br/>who likes to get caught.
Okay, now I have to wash up<br/>for two reasons.
Oh, you didn't.<br/>Uh-huh.
That's right.
So you and lily really think<br/>you can spend two weeks apart?
You know what, barney?
Lily and I are a lot less cheesy<br/>than you make us out to be.
Marshmallow, don't forget<br/>to pack my night-night tape.
Oh!
Night-night tape?
Did you make a tape
Of you saying<br/>"night-night" to her?
No.
He doesn't say it. He sings it.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Why don't you kiss?
I love it<br/>when two chicks make out.
Damn it.
Nobody's bought us anything<br/>cool yet off our registry.
What's on there?
Ooh, lots of stuff.
Kitchen aide artisan series<br/>tilt-head stand mixer...
Retail price:
$319.99. What else?
Um, the dyson dc17<br/>animal vacuum.
Ah, $549.99.
A little greedy,<br/>don't you think?
Did you memorize our registry?
No, I'm training.
Training? For what?
I'm glad you asked.
Ted, robin, get in here!
You guys know how
It's hard to be friends with me<br/>'cause I'm so awesome?
Yes, it's hard to be<br/>friends with you.
Go on.
Well, this isn't going<br/>to make it any easier.
I am going to be on...
The price is right.
No way!<br/>What?!
Yes, in a couple days,
Rich fields is going<br/>to call out my name,
And I will come on down.
(sighs):<br/>Oh...
Whoa, that is so awesome.
Barney, I didn't know you were
Such a fan of<br/>the price is right.
Are you kidding?
T.P.I.R. Is not just
An indescribably entertaining<br/>hour of television,
It's a microcosm
Of our entire economic system...
A capitalist utopia,<br/>where consumers are rewarded
For their persistence,<br/>market acumen
And intrepid spirit.
I gaze upon the glory<br/>of the price is right,
And I see the face of america.
And it is divine.
Plus, you know,<br/>hot chicks on sports cars.
Ted:<br/>Then lily headed out to robin's
For her first night<br/>away from marshall.
Lily:<br/>I'm ready!
(humming "wedding March")
Wow, lily, you look<br/>so beautiful.
I know! I'm beautiful!
(squeals)
I'm a fairy princess!
I'm too skinny for my dress!
Ted: Meanwhile, I was testing out<br/>my best man toast on marshall.
Here goes.
(clears throat)
Hello, everyone, I'm ted<br/>mosby, marshall's best man.
Strong opening, right?<br/>That's fantastic.
When marshall graduates<br/>this spring, he'll be a lawyer.
But did you know that marshall<br/>has a criminal record?
That's right, on a road trip<br/>up to cape cod,
Marshall was pulled over<br/>for driving by himself
In a car pool lane.
(short siren blast)
Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.
Marshall:<br/>Are you crazy?
You cannot tell that story<br/>at my wedding.
My entire family's
Gonna be there.
My little cousins,<br/>my mom, my grandma,
My grandpa the minister.
That grandpa died<br/>three years ago.
His favorite grandson<br/>is getting married, ted.
I think he can take a day off
From haunting the barn<br/>to make an appearance.
Whoo!
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-whoo!
Oh, yeah!<br/>Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
So which one, "a" or "b"?
What was that?
I have to decide
How to run to contestant's row
When they say,<br/>"barney stinson, come on down!"
Oh, oh, I didn't realize<br/>that's what it was.
Can you do them again?
Yeah, of course.
(loud thump)
Barney:<br/>Ow!
Hey!
Very funny.
(banging)
Just for that,<br/>when I win all the prizes.
The only thing<br/>you guys are getting
Is rice-a-roni and turtle wax.
It's $300 just to take<br/>the bust in?
Oh, please, you have to have<br/>some sympathy for me.
I'm getting married<br/>next Saturday,
And I'm too skinny for my dress.
I lost all this weight<br/>without even trying.
Hello? Hello?
What happened?
She called me a bitch<br/>and hung up.
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I guess I'll just<br/>have to pay the $300.
Pay the $300?
Lily, are you crazy?
This isn't a problem.
It's a license to eat.
Look, what have you always
Wanted to eat but didn't
Because it was<br/>too ridiculously decadent?
Ooh, a valrhona<br/>chocolate soufflé
With a raspberry brandy sauce,
Topped with caramelized bananas<br/>and hazelnut gelato.
I have cool whip<br/>and half a bag of fritos.
Done!
Okay, think you're gonna be<br/>happy with my new toast.
There's nothing sexual.
It's, uh, it's just the story
Of an important moment<br/>in your relationship.
Hello, everyone, I'm ted mosby,<br/>marshall's best man.
Nice.
Right?<br/>That's great.
Back when we were all freshman<br/>and marshall and lily
Were just a few short weeks<br/>into their relationship...
It was 4:00 in the morning,
And I'm not gonna lie,<br/>we were a wee bit wasted.
(both laughing)
So I'd gone out to get us some<br/>snacks, and when I got back...
I... Love you.
I love you, too.
I know it's soon
To say it,
But I'm so glad you did.
Oh.
Lily:<br/>Mm...
Yeah.
So here's what you<br/>want to talk about
In front of my entire family:
Drinking, having a girl<br/>in my room, eating junk food.
Dude, you're almost 30.
Your mom would be mad at you<br/>for eating junk food?
Yeah, ted, 'cause nutrition's<br/>not important.
Also, lily's never<br/>heard that story before.
How's she going to react<br/>when she finds out
The first time I said<br/>"I love you" to her,
I was actually saying it to you<br/>and a bag of funyuns?
But who cares?<br/>You did love her.
And you still do.
And you're totally over funyuns,<br/>so it's not weird.
Hey, lil.
Hey.
Hey?
(chuckles):<br/>That's it?
What are you talking about?
Well, you guys<br/>have been spending
I figured there'd be<br/>a lot of giggling, crying,
Jumping up and down, and then<br/>whatever lily would do.
About the bar menu at<br/>mcclaren's is that there were
No fewer than 11 different<br/>deep-fried appetizers.
That night,
Aunt lily ordered all of them.
Barney:<br/>Check it out.
Okay, imagine...<br/>Imagine, if you will,
That this is the $1 space
On the price is right wheel.
Ready?
(imitating beeping)
(beeping slows down)
(beeping stops)
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.
Close? Close?!
It's called the price is right,<br/>not the price is close!
Oh, man, this is bad.
If I don't win
The spin-off, and I can't get
Into the showcase showdown;<br/>everything's ruined!
It's all ruined!
What is ruined?
Why, why is this<br/>such a big deal?
Okay, guys...
Sit down. I've got<br/>to tell you something.
The reason I'm going<br/>on the price is right
Is because I've decided
That it's time for me<br/>to meet my real father.
Your father?
That's right.
My father...
Is bob barker.
("The price is right theme"<br/>playing)
Your dad...
Is bob barker?
That's right.
The host of the price is right,<br/>bob barker?
That's pops.
Barney?
Yes, robin?
Why in the world do you think
Bob barker is your father?
Uh, because my mother<br/>told me he was,
That's why.
Mom, who's my dad?
All the other kids at school<br/>know who their dad is.
Who's mine?
Oh, I don't know.
That guy.
Look, dad, I got straight a's!
Hey, dad,
Guess who I'm going as<br/>for Halloween?
Want to play some catch, pop?
So now I'm gonna go to l.A.,<br/>be on the show,
Win the showcase showdown,
(voice cracking):<br/>Make him proud of me,
And then tell him who I am.
You're gonna tell bob barker
That you're his son<br/>on national television?
Why is this so hard<br/>for you people to believe?
Drop the popper!
Lily has to gain
Five pounds in a<br/>week and a half,
And it is my job to<br/>help her get there.
This is the best<br/>wedding diet ever.
I lost a pound.
That is impossible.
You ate mcdonald's every meal<br/>for three days.
I knew that super size me guy<br/>was full of it.
Well, it must be<br/>the wedding stress.
We just got to up the intake.
Lily aldrin, drop and give me<br/>20 bites of fudge!
Okay.
Okay?
Don't nibble at it. Attack it!
Come on, lily.
You can do better than that!
I can't.
Well, eat faster,
Before your body<br/>figures out it's full.
(sobbing):<br/>I'm trying.
Oh, are you gonna cry?
You gonna cry?
Skinny little baby's gonna cry?
(muffled sobbing)<br/>well, eat, damn it, eat!
(muffled):<br/>Okay!
(sobbing)
Hey, so I think I figured out
How to do your toast
In a completely appropriate way.<br/>Finally.
Huh.<br/>Yeah.
(clearing throat)
Good evening. I'm ted mosby,<br/>marshall's best man.
Still strong, right?<br/>Great, yeah.
I'd like to share<br/>with you all a story
About the momentous evening<br/>last fall
When marshall and lily<br/>got back together.
Afterward, we stayed up<br/>till 10:00 at night,
Doing shots of chocolate milk.
Man, I'm well nourished<br/>right now!
Calcium promotes healthy teeth<br/>and bones.
Thanks, marshall,
For teaching us<br/>you don't need alcohol
To have fun.
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank my parents for<br/>teaching me good values.
Aww.
Now, I wasn't supposed<br/>to hear this next part,
But marshall leaned over<br/>to lily and whispered.
You know what I'd like<br/>to do to you right now?
I'd like to hold your hand.
I'd like to hold<br/>your hand so hard
That you're not able to<br/>shake hands for a week.
Oh.
Are you just going to talk<br/>about holding my hand
Or are you going to hold it?
Then a little later,<br/>robin caught them...
Oh, um...
Holding hands.
It was a lovely<br/>and responsible night.
To marshall and lily.
That's the worst toast<br/>I've ever heard, dude.
It's totally boring.
Exactly.
It's impossible<br/>to write a good toast
With you censoring me, man.
I give up.
I'm just going<br/>to read that thing
About Jesus and the footprints.
I give up, too.
I don't care<br/>if my dress doesn't fit.
I can't eat anymore.
I-I feel like my stomach's<br/>going to explode.
I know.
And so, lily and I were both<br/>about to give up,
But as you can all see,
Lily does look beautiful<br/>in that dress,
And here I am
Giving a toast.
You know, all this time,
I'd been racking my brain,
Trying to pick out<br/>the perfect moment
To capture lily and marshall<br/>as a couple.
But then I realized
The perfect moment wasn't<br/>some needle lost in the haystack
Of their ten years together.
The perfect
Lily and marshall moment<br/>happened two nights ago.
Marshall, what are you doing?
Going to the bathroom.
In the hall?
Sleepwalking?
You're wide awake.
Robbing us?
Dude.
Turns out,
All week long,
He'd been sneaking out<br/>to a hotel on 72nd,
To meet lily.
God, I missed you.
I can't sleep without you. Mm.
Hey, baby?
Would you be the big spoon<br/>for a while?
Sure, baby.
How's the weight gaining going?
Ugh, terribly.
I'm too stressed out<br/>without you around.
Mm.
Well, I'm here now.
Mmm.<br/>Mmm!
In their experiment<br/>with apartness,
But they succeeded in getting<br/>lily into her dress.
You know, there really are
A million things I could tell<br/>you about lily and marshall,
But really, the only thing<br/>you need to know is
That ten years<br/>into their relationship,
They still couldn't spend<br/>a single night apart.
May they never have to again.
To lily and marshall.
All:<br/>To lily and marshall.
Now, kids, the story
Of aunt lily and uncle<br/>marshall's wedding
Is a good one.
No matter how perfectly<br/>you plan your...
You know what,<br/>wait a second, guys.
I'm going to get to that.
First, I gotta tell you<br/>what happened with barney.
Rich, what is the name<br/>of our next participant?
Rich:<br/>Bob, it's barney stinson!
Come on down!
You're the next contestant<br/>on the price is right.
No!<br/>Oh, my god!
Bob barker:<br/>Working his way out.
High-five here,<br/>high-five there.
A big old hug here.
Oh, my god!<br/>Yeah, I know,
The camera loves me.
Welcome to contestant's<br/>row, barney.
Nice suit.
Thanks, da... Bob.
Here is the next item up
For bid!
Rich: Bob, the stylish<br/>his and her watches
Feature an 18-carat gold bezel<br/>and crown
And stainless steel bands.
Bob: And barney, what<br/>do you bid on that?
Um...
(audience shouting)
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Retail price is $1,349.99,
So, since you round off,<br/>I'll say $1,350, bob.
$1,350 for barney.
So, was it $1,350?
I don't know.
Was it?
Oh, my god!
Happy wedding.
(gasps) (barney chuckling)
Barney, you won that camcorder
In just one second!
That is impressive.
I mean impressive.
Thank you, bob.<br/>Now,
To win the computer,
You're going to<br/>have to bid again.
And again I will say<br/>higher or lower.
And let's show the<br/>audience the price
Of the computer, and audience,
Please, do not try to help us.
And the clock will start<br/>with your first bid.
$1 billion.
Lower.<br/>So, I brought some photos
That I thought<br/>you might like to see.
This is me on my first birthday.
Yes, barney.<br/>This is...
What are you doing?
Uh, spending some quality time<br/>with my dad.
That's very nice, but look,<br/>the clock is moving.
You have only about 16 seconds.
Right.<br/>Keep bidding.
No, no, I want you to see this.<br/>This is great. Keep bidding.
This is me at my graduation.
I know, the hair. That,<br/>no, that's nice.
That's nice.<br/>You have only
Five, four, three, two, one...<br/>Right, oh, look.
$999.
(bell ringing) nine...
Barney, you got it<br/>exactly right!
Happy wedding again! Oh, my...
Oh, my god!<br/>(laughing)
I have to be honest, bob.
The big wheel is the only<br/>weak part of my game.
I'm sure you'll do<br/>just fine, son.
Did you just...
I'm ready, bob.
Do it! Do it!
Here we go!
He's looking for the dollar.
It's going 'round, and 'round...
Oh, no, you spun it too hard.
No, he didn't spin it<br/>hard enough.
Here it comes, barney.
It's coming on down.<br/>(all imitating beeping)
You've got it!
You won...<br/>(screaming)
(screaming)
Beautiful.<br/>But barney...
Barney, you're not through.
You're not through.<br/>(screaming)
You've won $1,000.
You've won a place<br/>in the showcase.
You are doing splendidly so far.
Thank you. Would you, would<br/>you say you're proud of me?
Sure.
That was kind of a weird moment.
Very well, barney,
You have seen<br/>the first showcase.
Do you want to bid on it,
Or do you want to<br/>pass it to millie?
Please, no car<br/>and an above-ground spa?
Pass.
Bob: Millie, he has passed<br/>this showcase to you.
What do you bid on it?<br/>Uh...
$17,640.
Bob:<br/>$17,640.
Barney (under breath):<br/>Overbid!
Now, let's see showcase ♪2.
Rich: Barney, your showcase<br/>begins with a mystery.
Oh, I love this.
I can't believe how excited<br/>I am right now.
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Barney, you have seen<br/>your showcase.
What do you bid on it?
(audience shouting)
Please, please.
Please.
Let me.
(audience shouting)
1-8-4-2-1.
I don't even know<br/>what we're going to do
With a dune buggy,<br/>but I want it!
Yeah. Please.
And the actual retail price
Of your showcase is...
$14,628.
Bob:<br/>$14,628.
(buzzer buzzing)<br/>millie, you are over.
Too bad.
Barney, you bid $18,421<br/>on your showcase.
And the actual retail price
Of barney's showcase is...
$18,421, exactly right!
You win both showcases, barney.
Oh, my god!<br/>Oh, my god.
(screaming)
(cheering)
(bell ringing) bob<br/>barker, reminding you,
Help control the pet...
Bob, bob, excuse me. Yeah.
Before, before you<br/>wrap up the show,
There's just something I<br/>want to say to you. Yes?
Congratulations
On 35 wonderful years<br/>hosting the price is right.
Well, thank you, barney.
Thank you ver... Have your<br/>pets spayed or neutered.
(voice cracking):<br/>Good-bye, everybody.
Why didn't you tell him?
Well, it's just...
If you lived your whole life<br/>thinking one thing,
It would be pretty devastating<br/>to find out that wasn't true.
I just don't think<br/>bob could have handled it.
Bob.<br/>Yeah.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah, he's really sensitive.
Anyway, on the bright side.
(gasps) happy wedding again!
And that's the story
Of how uncle barney gave<br/>marshall and lily a dune buggy
For their wedding.
Hey, lily.
Um, I thought since we're going<br/>to be apart for two whole weeks,
I would sing you<br/>your night-night song.
Mm.

[<div class="full-script">Ted: In may of 2007, aunt lily<br/>and uncle marshall got married
At the historic van smoot house<br/>in upstate new york.
(gasps)
Wow, it's beautiful, lily.
Yeah.
It's just how<br/>I always pictured it.
Ted:<br/>Well, that was a load of crap.
You see, kids,<br/>when you get married,
You learn a hard lesson.
The wedding you set out to have
Is almost never the wedding<br/>you end up with.
So, we've decided
On a small, outdoor wedding,
Just family and close friends.
No more than 25 people
In a beautiful garden somewhere,
Maybe an acoustic guitar playing
While we walk down the aisle.
And maybe you already know<br/>someone who went down
To the courthouse and registered<br/>as an officiant
So that he or she... he...<br/>Could perform the ceremony.
But you hate marriage.
Why do you want<br/>to perform the ceremony?
Because it subtly implants<br/>in the mind of every woman there
That when I ask a question,<br/>you say, "I do."
Yeah.
The closer you get<br/>to the big day,
The more concessions you make.<br/>Great.
Now my mom's making me<br/>invite the lessners.
This puts our numbers<br/>in the triple digits.
Wow. I guess sometimes,<br/>lessner is more... Ner.
You know how like<br/>sometimes less is more.
Yeah. This is one of<br/>those times, sweetie.
You know what?<br/>That's okay.
It'll be a slightly<br/>big outdoor wedding.
So it's not going to be<br/>an outdoor wedding anymore.
Marshall's dad is convinced<br/>if we have an outdoor wedding
In new york,<br/>he's going to get mugged,
So it's going to be inside now.
It'll be great.
We're still going to have
Our acoustic guitar player.
So now, instead<br/>of an acoustic guitar,
We're having a harp player.
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and...
That guy's daughter<br/>plays the harp.
Is she hot?
I'd love to be able to cross<br/>"harp player" off my list.
How long is this list?
Dude, I'm not gonna count<br/>how many pages the list is.
I'm not crass.
Well, it doesn't matter<br/>anyway. She's pregnant.
Sweet! I can cross<br/>off two things.
Ted: So the day arrived<br/>for lily and marshall's
Very big indoor wedding...<br/>With a harp.
Hi, lily.
Wow. Andrea.
You really are pregnant.
Yeah.<br/>Um...
How do you play the harp<br/>with your belly so...?
Oh, I don't really... I can only<br/>reach about half the strings.
You only play half the harp?
Yeah.
Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Lily, I will take care of this.
Um, I'll just pluck<br/>the other half.
Is it hard to learn?
I've been studying the harp<br/>for 12 years.
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.
You ever hear of "guitar hero"?<br/>Learned that in a day.
Is there a "harp hero"?
Robin, it's fine.
So, so, when are you due?
Tuesday.
Wow, that's soon.
Last Tuesday.
Holy crap, we have to fire her.
She's gonna drop a shorty<br/>in the middle of your ceremony.
Robin, I'm not going<br/>to freak myself out.
I hate those women who say, "oh,<br/>my wedding has to be perfect."
Things go wrong.
Sometimes the deejay<br/>screws up your playlist.
Sometimes you slip on placenta<br/>during the recessional.
Hey, can I grab a scotch<br/>and soda real quick?
Nope; I'm not allowed to serve<br/>anything until the reception.
Wow. You just cost yourself<br/>a big tip, buddy.
I'm not allowed<br/>to accept tips, buddy.
You allowed to accept criticism?
You, sir, are an ass... Buddy.
Hey, you want to know what line<br/>doesn't work on a harp player?
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"
Really? That didn't work.
Not even a little.
Huh.<br/>Hey!
Who's bill?
Bill?
Yeah. This guy came up<br/>to me at the bar.
Can I ask you something?
Where in the ceremony is<br/>the place where they ask
If anyone objects?
Uh... Don't think<br/>they do that anymore.
Oh, so when do you think<br/>someone should do it?
Just wait for a lull or what?
Oh, no.
Did he look like a guy who tried
To be an umpire but failed?
He kind of did.
That's scooter.
Your high school boyfriend,<br/>scooter?
His real name is bill.
My mom must have invited him.
Why? Why would she do that?
Our families are really close.
But my ex-boyfriend?
Come on, mom.
I didn't invite that<br/>professional squash player
Dad busted you with.
Oh, I need a glass
Of wine.<br/>I'll get it.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, how's marshall doing?
He's great.
He's about to get his hair cut.
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's<br/>going to cut it too short.
Me, too. I was up all night.
Hello, lily.
Hey, bill.
Hey, barney.
Scooter, what are<br/>you doing here?
It's not "scooter" anymore.
It's bill.
A lot of things have changed<br/>about me, lily,
But one hasn't.
I still love you.
And I came here to win you back.
(laughing):<br/>You're really cute.
Oh, no. Really?
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,<br/>but I love you, and if you
Can look me in the eye
And tell me that you<br/>want to marry marshall,
I will leave right now and be<br/>out of your life forever.
I want...
I...
I want...
Scooter!
And I need you<br/>to get out of my face.
It's for the bride, so...
White or red?
White.
And, uh...
She'd also like<br/>a scotch and soda.
She'd also like a bowl<br/>of smoked almonds.
I don't have any,<br/>but I guess I could run out
To the corner and get some.
Well, it's only the biggest day
Of her life, so...
Let the games begin.
Here. Can't stay.<br/>Got to try something.
Maybe my words<br/>won't change your mind,
But maybe the words<br/>of a poet will.
I read from "November rain."
By w. Axl rose.
That is a good song.
Barney said you<br/>needed me to bounce
Some guy named scooter?
What's up with bill?
That's scooter.
I'm on it.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Can I have your phone number?
No.
It's for the bride.
Oh. Hold on.
Let me go get a pen.
The bride wants you<br/>to walk slower.
Oh...
Oh, wow.
Oh. Robin...
My makeup looks<br/>perfect right now,
And I'm about to cry.<br/>Do something.
Oh. Um...
Uh. I have hairy nipples.
Really?
No, but it worked, didn't it?
Hey. Funny story.
I tackled this guy<br/>I thought was scooter.
Turns out it was<br/>your photographer.
Don't worry.
I got this sweet camera phone,
So we're covered.
There's no photographer?
Okay, I just have to call...<br/>Robin, stop. Stop.
It's okay. I am not gonna let<br/>anything get to me today.
I just got a call<br/>from the florist.
The flowers won't be here till<br/>halfway through the ceremony.
I'm okay.
I hate to bother you, but...
I think I found your veil<br/>in the parking lot.
I'm fine.
Just fyi: My water broke.
But I can probably...
(panting sharply)
Make it through.
Totally cool.
Oh, no.
Lily, I think I forgot<br/>your bridal panties.
I-I thought I had them.<br/>I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's okay, I'll just<br/>wear the ones I have on.
Are you sure?
I'm marrying marshall today.
So it doesn't even matter
That I'm gonna walk down<br/>the aisle without a veil
In a room that has no flowers
To the music of half a harp
Played by a woman<br/>who's crowning,
As my high school boyfriend
Reads guns n' roses lyrics.
But that's okay,
Because there's<br/>no photographer there
To take any pictures<br/>of it anyway.
(chuckles)
Lily, are you okay?
What do you think?!
Of course I'm not okay!
Everything that could possibly<br/>go wrong at my wedding has!
Well...<br/>It's ruined!
What happened to "I don't<br/>want a perfect wedding"?
Oh, grow up, robin!
Of course I want<br/>a perfect wedding!
Oh, god.
I wanted... I wanted not to care<br/>about the wedding, but...
I do.
I... I'm supposed to feel<br/>like a princess today.
And you will.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
I have something<br/>that'll make you feel better.
(scoffs) what could you have
That could possibly<br/>make me feel better?
(sighs)
God, I hope marshall's<br/>having a better day
Than I'm having.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.<br/>Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
What?
Well, it's not too short.
(harp playing,<br/>people chattering)
(screams)
My hair! Look at my hair!
She ruined my hair!
I look like one of<br/>the backstreet boys!
(laughing):<br/>You totally do.
And not even<br/>the good backstreet boys,
The older, lame dance move,<br/>comeback tour backstreet boys.
The good backstreet boys?
Marshall:<br/>Guys! Guys!
What am I gonna do?!
What-what the hell<br/>happened to you?
Lily's cousin<br/>is in beauty school,
And lily didn't want her<br/>to do her hair,
So she said she could do mine.
So, um, just not-not<br/>too short, okay?
Mm-hmm. Oh, no, we don't<br/>even have to cut it at all.
Could just give it some style.
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.
'Cause, um, when it gets too<br/>short, it starts to look weird.
And I don't want to look weird<br/>when I'm up there, you know.
Ooh, I could give you<br/>some cool guy tips.
I don't think I need advice<br/>on how to be cool,
But yeah, great, lay them on me.
I can't get married like this!
There's no way!
Ah, let me see what I can do.
What? What can you do?
I have a superpower.
Lily is gonna kill me!
She's not gonna want<br/>to marry me like this.
That's crazy.<br/>Of course she will.
Would you marry me?
No. But not because of the hair.
It's because I have a rule:
Never marry anyone you've had<br/>a farting contest with.
Oh, great.
So now you're saying lily and I<br/>shouldn't even get married?
Could I have everyone's<br/>attention, please?
It's for the bride.
One, the bride would...
Like all of this tension<br/>out of my shoulders.
And she would like, let's say,
You in the inappropriately
Short dress
To rub them.
Two...
What was two?
Okay, we have a bit<br/>of a situation.
Let's not panic.
Let's just find a solution.
(both screaming)
Dude, you shaved<br/>your freakin' head.
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.
I ought to shave it all off.
What a great solution.
Just be bald 'cause<br/>it's cool, right?
Bruce willis, michael jordan,<br/>britney spears...
Oh, god, what did I do?!
How could you let me<br/>shave my head?!
You're the worst best man ever!
I hate you!
I'm not going out there!
I'm leaving and I'm<br/>never coming back.
I'm gonna go find<br/>that money under the rock
By the tree and go live
With the guys on the beach<br/>in zihautanejo.
Only red andy<br/>was falsely accused.
Ted, you're my best man!<br/>You got to do something!
Okay, all right, come here.
Just breathe,<br/>breathe, all right?
Don't worry.<br/>Don't worry.
I'll just...<br/>I'll take these.
No!
Uh, hi.<br/>Uncle ben, right?
Yes.
Yes, we're, we're having<br/>a little bit
Of a problem back there.
Um, and I was wondering<br/>if you could help us out.
Yeah.
Marshall accidentally<br/>shaved part of his head.
Oh, no!<br/>Yeah.
Yeah, so here's<br/>what I was thinking.
Um, what if I found something<br/>to cover up the bald area?
Yeah, that would probably work,<br/>but with what?
Hmm, that's a tough one.
Maybe a wig of some sort<br/>or a, um...
Toupee.
Something that
Matches his hair color,
Which is,<br/>which is kind of the same color
As the top of your hair.
Mm, yeah.
Does anyone here wear a toupee?
Shouldn't be hard to find out.
Most of them are pretty bad.
That is true.<br/>That is true.
We just need to find someone<br/>who wears a toupee
That is the same color<br/>as marshall's
And your hair.
Boy, that's a pretty tall order.
Really? You can't think<br/>of any place
In the general area<br/>where there might
Be a toupee of the kind<br/>I'm describing to you?
No, not off the top of my...
No. Can't.
All right, let me come at this<br/>from a different angle.
I got $50 in my pocket
Which is probably a lot more...
The bride needs this.
Actually, I think<br/>it kinda works.
It totally does.
Barney?
To be honest,
I'm, uh, I'm jealous<br/>I don't get to wear it.
Okay, problem solved.<br/>Crisis averted.
Let's get me married.
It looks terrible, doesn't it?
It kinda looks like fur,
Which gives you the appearance
Of a cleaned-up bigfoot.
Oh, you know...
In a bad way.
Hey, cool hair, bro.
What happened to your shirt?
I got sauce on it
When I tackled the caterer.
You gonna put another shirt on?
No, I'm good.
Hey, you guys seen scooter?
What? What? Scooter's here?
That guy's at my wedding?
Not for long, bro.
Not for long.
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.
I think we should go<br/>for a walk, okay?
Yep.
It would cover up the problem.
It's festive and it<br/>celebrates the heritage
Of this great nation.
Okay, unless you actually<br/>have one in your car,
Stop suggesting authentic<br/>native american headdress.
Oh, no.
Oh, my god!
Lily, you're not supposed<br/>to see me.
Holy crap, I don't think
Anyone's supposed to see you.
What happened?<br/>Did amy do this to you?
Just the frosted tips.<br/>I did the rest.
I'm sorry, baby.
I've ruined the whole wedding,<br/>haven't I?
Oh, no, you didn't ruin<br/>the wedding, sweetie.
It was already ruined.
There's no flowers,<br/>no photographer.
Oh, and scooter's here,<br/>by the way.
Yeah, I know. I heard.
My veil got thrashed;<br/>the harp player is in labor,
And I'm not wearing<br/>my wedding underwear.
What? No "property of marshall"<br/>across the back?
How are people going to know<br/>whose butt that is?
What happened?
Remember the wedding we wanted,<br/>the intimate outdoor ceremony?
I wish we could have<br/>that wedding.
So do it.
What?
Get married now.
Right here.
Look, it's outside<br/>like you always wanted.
Intimate, close friends.
There's no guitar,
But it's pretty close.
Barney can officiate.
Yes.
Yes, I can.
Uh, excuse me, guys.
You all dropped something:
Your jaws...<br/>Because barney stinson
Is about to aid and abet<br/>a marriage.
Could we even do that?
I mean, what about all<br/>those people in there?
Do that one, too.
And then when everything<br/>goes wrong, you won't care
Because you already had<br/>the real wedding out here.
What do you think, baby?
I love it.
Me, too.
Let's do it.
Let's get married<br/>before we get married.
Oh, great.
Wait, hold on.
Excuse me, sir.<br/>Could we borrow your hat?
Okay.
Thank you.
Hat. We thought of authentic<br/>native american headdress
Before we thought of hat.
Thank you all for coming.
For those of you<br/>who don't know me...
I'm not the biggest believer<br/>in marriage.
But... You two are so great<br/>together, you know?
Uh, it's like you were, uh,<br/>made for each other.
He's gonna cry.
No, I'm not.
(playing lilting melody)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,<br/>I'm not, I'm not.
(clears throat)
Lily and marshall...
When everyone sees you, they...
See true love.
(voice breaking):<br/>It's the best love...
Can we just, um, move on<br/>to the rings or something?
Oh, no.
I don't have my vows.
I don't have mine either.
You don't need your vows.
Just say why you<br/>love each other.
Okay, I'll go first.
Lily, there are a million<br/>reasons why I love you.
You make me laugh
And you take care of me<br/>when I'm sick.
You're sweet and caring
And you even created an egg dish<br/>and named it after me.
She puts a little italian<br/>dressing in scrambled eggs
Before she cooks them.
It's called "eggs marshall,"<br/>and it's awesome.
But the main reason<br/>that I love you is
That you're my<br/>best friend, lily.
You're, uh...
You're the best friend<br/>that I've ever had.
I'm sorry, buddy.
No problem.
It's totally okay.
My turn.
Oh, thank you.
Marshall,
I love you because you're,
You're funny<br/>and you make me feel loved
And you make me feel safe
And for our anniversary,<br/>you gave me a sweatshirt
That says, "lily and marshall.<br/>Rockin' it since '96."
I kinda wish<br/>I was wearing it right now
'cause it smells like you.
But the main reason I love you,<br/>marshall ericksen,
Is you make me happy.
You make me happy all the time.
Hey, I found your panties!
I'm good.
Okay.
Marshall, do you take lily<br/>to be your wife
To have and to hold<br/>from this day forward?
From this day forward so as long<br/>as you both shall live?
I do.
Lily, do you promise to take<br/>marshall to be your husband
From this day forward<br/>as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Okay, then,
By the power vested in me
By the very bitter old pakistani<br/>man who works down
At the courthouse<br/>on lafayette street,
I now pronounce you<br/>man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Oh...<br/>Oh...
Do you smoke?
No.
Wow. First lie of the marriage.
That was fast.
After that,<br/>we all went back inside
For the second wedding.
And yeah, a lot of things<br/>did go wrong,
But it didn't matter
Because when we all look back<br/>on that day,
What I remember<br/>is the first wedding;
The intimate outdoor ceremony<br/>with just close friends
And an acoustic guitar.

Oh...
How do you feel?
Tired. I got married<br/>twice today.
Ooh.
So where do you want to do it<br/>for the first time

Nice hotel room<br/>or a reception hall bathroom?

Bathroom, of course.
Mm.

Every time we get near the food,
We get cocktail weiner blocked.
Marshall!
(glasses clinking)
(cheering)
We haven't eaten all day.
All right, let's<br/>run some interference.
Yeah, we'll get you<br/>back to your table.
Come on.
Oh, there you are.
My dear...
You look so beautiful.
Thanks, grammie, but we really need to...<br/>And you...
You look like a 1940s<br/>movie star.
And you look like a pepper-crusted<br/>rack of lamb with mint jelly.
All right, let's get<br/>these two back to their table.
We will see you on the floor for<br/>the conga line later, won't we?
Ted: The answer to that one<br/>was decided weeks earlier.
Hmm... Conga line.
Oh, yes, definitely.
How about a slide show<br/>of you guys through the years
Set to green day's<br/>"time of your life"
And ending with your baby photos<br/>side by side.
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.
What list?
Horrible wedding clichés
We're not going to touch<br/>with a ten-foot limbo pole.
Oh, like first corinthians?
That bible verse? They do<br/>that at every wedding.
How's it go?
"Love is patient and kind.
"Love does not envy or boast.
"It is not arrogant or rude.
"Love does not insist<br/>on it's own way.
"It is not irritable<br/>or resentful.
"Love bears all things,
"believes all things,<br/>hopes all things...
Endures all things."
Lame.<br/>Going on the list.
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.
Wait, isn't doing it in<br/>the reception hall bathroom
Kind of a cliché?
Well, okay, one cliché.
Well, technically two.
No! They cleared<br/>our plates again!
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,<br/>where did you go?!
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have<br/>my way with you.
Oh, well, you still have me.
Yeah...
Anyway, guys,
We're kind of in the middle<br/>of something,
So if you could go bicker
Or share a tense,<br/>sexless silence
Or whatever married people do<br/>somewhere else, that'd be great.
No, barney, this is my wedding,
And I will sit wherever<br/>I damn well...
Are those mini quiches?
Tell the secret.
Okay, uh... (clearing throat)<br/>it was our anniversary,
So we went to this<br/>restaurant carmichael's,
Which is where we went<br/>on our first date.
Remember, the place<br/>where I stole
The blue french horn for robin?
Oh, right, that was you.
I knew that was somebody I knew.
What?
Dude, you were there.
That was like a big iconic<br/>moment in all of our lives.
Maybe in your life...<br/>I got a lot of stuff going on.
Okay, so we're sitting there
And the waiter comes over...
Champagne?
Um, we didn't order champagne.
Compliments of the house.
Wow.
Thanks.
Cheers.
And there, sitting at the bottom
Of my champagne glass is...
Mini quiche.
You're a mega-douche.
Oh, that's right,
They moved that table<br/>back toward the kitchen,
Because that's where<br/>they're setting up
A surprise chocolate fountain.
Oh, no, I gave it away.
(lily grunting)
So what was in the glass?
Right.
So the waiter comes up<br/>with two glasses of dom.
He says, "champagne?"
"we didn't order<br/>any champagne."
"compliments of the house."<br/>"wow."
You said that already!
Right. So robin looks down,
And there at the bottom<br/>of her glass...
Robin:<br/>Is an engagement ring.
Anything you want to say<br/>to the bride and groom?
Don't get married.
Why don't I come back.
An engagement ring?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot<br/>do this to me. No.
No, no, no!
That's what she said.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.
No. No, no, no.
What are you talking about?
This. This is what<br/>I'm talking about.
What is this doing<br/>in my champagne?
Oh, god, listen...<br/>I just got to get out of here.
That's not mine.
What?
That's not mine.
Then whose is it?
It's mine.
Janna...
Will you marry me?
Yes.
(chuckles)
(applause)
(chuckles)
Wow.
That was hilarious.
I was like... What?
Anyway.
What the hell was that?
What the hell was what?
That reaction?
I thought you were proposing<br/>to me.
Really? Because it sounded like
You thought I was trying<br/>to set you on fire.
Ted, you know how I feel<br/>about marriage.
Now more than ever.
I'm sorry, were you planning<br/>on proposing tonight?
No.<br/>Then why is this an issue?
Because even though you<br/>don't want to get married,
I'd like to think the fact that<br/>we've been together for a year,
And that we love each other<br/>might get me a gentler reaction
Than, "no. No, no, no,<br/>no, no, no, no, no."
"ted, you cannot do this to me.
No. No, no, no."
(sighs) okay, you're right, I just...<br/>Freaked out.
I don't know why.
I'm sorry.
Can we please just let it go?
No.
Hey, stinson.
Never lie to a man<br/>about a chocolate fountain.
So did you guys find<br/>anything to eat?
I had four strawberries.
Was there a side of champagne
With each of the strawberries?
(belching):<br/>Yes.
Marshall:<br/>Lily, you could have burped
Or said the word "yes,"
But the fact that you did both
Is exactly why I married you.
Mmm.
Oh, look, more strawberries!
(sighs)
(laughing)
So what happened next?
Ted, don't do this.
No, seriously.
Where do you see yourself<br/>in five years?
Where do you see yourself?
Honestly, in five years...
I probably want to be married.
And I probably want<br/>to be in argentina.
Argentina?
Or tokyo, or paris.
Look, ted, I don't know where<br/>I'm going to be in five years.
And I don't want to know.
I want my life<br/>to be an adventure.
We have an expiration date,<br/>don't we?
Oh, my god.
You guys broke up.
Lily:<br/>Whoo!
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.
Barney...
Story's not over.
Can we please not talk<br/>about this here.
Can we go home?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, excuse me,<br/>I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually have...<br/>Oh, my god, it's you.
Wha... What?
You're the son of a bitch
Who stole our blue french horn.
Run!
Barney:<br/>Run?
Your strategy was run?
It was a perfectly good idea.
They didn't have<br/>our credit card information.
They didn't know us from adam.
I stand by it.
Yeah?
And how did that<br/>work out for you?
Hey!<br/>Oh!
(robin screams)
I don't see why they had
To keep my credit car<br/>and driver's license
Till we bring the horn back.
Well, come on, ted,<br/>can you blame them?
Look, I'm sorry<br/>about the french horn.
I want to make this right.
So what we're going to do<br/>right now is, we're going
To run!
(glass breaking) ooh.
So...
Argentina.
Argentina.
Why is this the first I've heard<br/>of argentina?
Mmm, american schools suck<br/>at geography.
What would be the point<br/>in telling you
That I want to live<br/>in argentina?
You don't want to live there.<br/>I could
Want to live in argentina.
No, you couldn't.
I mean, you life is here<br/>and your career.
I'm a journalist, my career<br/>could take me anywhere,
And I hope it does.<br/>Hey.
I could be an architect<br/>anywhere, too.
They have buildings<br/>in argentina.
And paris.<br/>And even tokyo.
I don't know<br/>if you ever saw godzilla,
But he wasn't knocking down<br/>a bunch of tents.
You're saying you want to move<br/>to argentina?
Well, I always regretted
Not taking a year in college<br/>to live abroad.
I just finished<br/>a big project at work.
I... I got some money saved up.
If ever there were a time<br/>in my life
To do something like this,<br/>it's right now.
Let's move to argentina.
Oh, shut up.
You're scared I might<br/>not be kidding.
Aren't you?
Nope.
Your move, scherbatsky.
Okay.
Let's do it...<br/>Let's move to argentina.
¡No es posible!
Nobody moves to argentina.
The argentinean peso
Has dropped two-thirds<br/>in five years,
The government is opposed<br/>to free market reforms,
And the railroad has been a mess
Since the breakup<br/>of ferrocarriles argentinos.
I hooked up with<br/>an argentinean exchange student
In a porta-john<br/>outside yankee stadium.
Man, she was chatty.
Right? Right?
You caught the bouquet?
Barney.
The story's not over yet.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?
I don't know if I can do this to you.<br/>Do what?
Well, you say you want<br/>to move to argentina,
But you want to have kids.
Oh, right. 'cause<br/>there are no kids there.
On santa's map of the world,
There's a big black<br/>"x" over argentina.
You know what I mean.
No, I don't.
Okay, say we had kids.<br/>Yeah.
They wouldn't have to grow up
In some suburb somewhere.
They would grow up on the road
Having adventures with us.
Think of all the hard rock cafe<br/>t-shirts they could collect.
Ted, you know that kids were<br/>never a part of my plan.
But if I was going<br/>to have someone's babies,
I'd have your babies.
That's when you run.
Tell me you ran, ted.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't want to start having<br/>babies right this second.
Do you have a...?
No, I don't.
Well, we probably shouldn't.
Yeah.
Risk it?
Risk it.
No.
All right, ladies and<br/>gentlemen, if you will
Gather around, lily and marshall<br/>are going to cut the cake.
No.
Robin, you're not...
No, say the story's not over.
Come on, they're<br/>cutting the cake.
Say the story's not over!
Oh, god, this is<br/>the 12th most worried
I've ever been<br/>that someone's pregnant.
(lily laughing)
Okay, lily.
I'm really hungry,<br/>so let's just, uh,
Aim for my mouth, okay?
Besides, the smearing the cake<br/>thing's a cliché, remember?
No, it's going to be so funny.
(distorted):<br/>Lily.
Lily, just feed me the cake.
Please, baby, I am so hungry.
(guests gasping)
(lily laughing) marshall:<br/>Whoopsy-daisy.
And she's okay.
She's all right.
That was funny. And it's<br/>time for the honeymoon.
You know?
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.
We love you.
I love you.
Getting married,
Having kids.
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible,<br/>horrible mistake.
God, this guy's<br/>giving me nothing.
All right, have fun in scotland.
If you see the<br/>loch ness monster,
Tell him ted mosby<br/>says, "what's up?"
Nessie's a she, ted, come on.
Good-bye.
(cheering)
Hey, kiddo.
Tsk.
You are going to miss out<br/>on a lot of awesome stuff.
With the kid<br/>while I am out awesome-ing
All over the place.
And you're going to get fat.
The story's not over, barney.
Okay, time to get the<br/>horn back to the bistro.
Oh, ted, I don't know<br/>if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.
Not a euphemism.
Oh.
(laughing):<br/>Right.
Okay, let me just go change,<br/>and we'll leave.
Whoa, whoa, you get<br/>to change and I don't?
Uh-uh.
Solidarity, sister.
I have a change of clothes<br/>and you don't. Suck it up.
Well, if we'd actually<br/>moved in together,
All my stuff would be<br/>here, but we didn't, so...
Yeah.
We were all talk, weren't we?
We're not doing this, are we?
I don't want<br/>to have kids in argentina.
To have kids in argentina.
So where does that leave us?
Well...
We could stay together and...
Pretend this stuff<br/>doesn't matter.
Or...
We could give back<br/>the blue french horn.
You stole<br/>a blue french horn for me.
I would have stolen<br/>you a whole orchestra.
♪
You did break up.
Yep.
You're not pregnant?
Nope.
An-and marshall<br/>and lily don't know?
Well, afterwards,
Uh, we came by to tell you guys,
But lily was<br/>pretty stressed out, so...
Robin: We decided not to say<br/>anything till after the wedding.
Whoa.
You guys okay?
Well, it hasn't been the easiest<br/>two weeks of our lives, but...
But we're okay.
The open bar helps.
Boy:<br/>Excuse me, miss.
Hi.
Could I have this dance?
Well, we knew this day<br/>would come eventually.
Take care of her, little man.
(sighs)
(squeals) mmm.
Uh-huh.
(both laughing)
This is by far the drunkest<br/>I've ever seen you.
Uh, driver.
Hello!
(laughing): Oh! Ranjit.
Hey, can we make a stop before<br/>we head back to the hotel?
You do not have to stop.
You can be together
As man and wife<br/>right back there,
And because we are friends...
I will not watch.
Um, no, we actually had<br/>something else in mind.
(both laughing)
Okay.
Lily, go sit down.
Welcome to wienerburger.
Hi.
Uh, can we get a<br/>number one, please,
With no pickles?
And a number four<br/>with no onions.
Let me guess.
Jefferson high prom?
No.
But thank you.
Uh, actually,
We just got married.
Wow.
Congratulations.<br/>Thank you.
That's $7.80.
Hey, dude.
Yeah.
I don't know how to say this,
But your wife just threw up<br/>in the trash.
My wife.
Ted: So marshall and<br/>lily were married,
And robin and I were broken up.
And as hard as it was<br/>at the time,
In the end we both<br/>got what we wanted.
She did go on<br/>to live in argentina
And morocco and greece,
Russia,<br/>even japan for a little while.
And I... Well, I met your mom.
I think for the most part<br/>if you're really honest
With yourself about what you<br/>want out of life,
Life gives it to you.
Mmm.
Of course, at that moment,<br/>all I really wanted
Was a scotch and soda<br/>and a cigar.
♪
Hey.
I'm really sorry<br/>about you and robin.
I know I was always joking<br/>around about wanting you two
To break up, but you were<br/>really good together.
Yeah... We were.
She just wasn't<br/>the one, you know?
The one.
Oh, ted, no.
Do not tell me you're going
To start searching<br/>for "the one" again.
The only time I want to hear<br/>you saying "the one" is
If it's followed<br/>by the word "hundredth."
(sing-songy):<br/>What up?
No, I need a break<br/>from all that, I...
I just want to get out there
And have fun for<br/>a while, you know?
Really?
(clearing throat):<br/>'cause...
You know, you've been<br/>in a relationship for a year.
You're going to...<br/>Be a little rusty.
Yeah.
I'm just saying...
You're gonna need, need,<br/>need some help out there.
Could be.
Ted?
Yes, barney.
Do you think...
Do you think maybe you<br/>might... Need a wingman again?
I do.
Yes!
Yes!
We're back.
We are back.
And ted, my boy,<br/>it's going to be legend...

[<div class="full-script">Kids, there more than one story<br/>of how I met your mother.
You know the short version, the thing<br/>with your mom's yellow umbrella.
But there's a bigger story.
The story of how I became who I had<br/>to become before I could meet her.
And that story begins,<br/>here.
...dary!
Legendary!
Dude, I am so excited<br/>that you're single again.
We are going to conquer<br/>New York City.
I already have a girl<br/>from work lined up for you.
Right boob bigger<br/>than the left boob,

I choose to look at as bra half full.
I don't know.
Robin and I broke up<br/>two weeks ago.
I'm... I'm not ready.
When will you be ready?
It was a good question.
After a big relationship ends,<br/>you need some time to recuperate.
Robin took a trip to Argentina,<br/>and I went through my usual routine.
I grew my breakup beard.
Ted Mosby, suit up,
'cause here's the plan.<br/>There's a Miss Nassau County pageant.
We'll pretend to be judges<br/>and, yes, our votes are for sale.
I'm not ready.
I repainted the apartment.

How I met your mother<br/>3x01 - Wait For It...
I just can't believe her.
We have this totally amicable split,<br/>everything's cool.
And she comes back<br/>from vacation with that guy?
You know what she's doing?
She's trying to win the breakup.
What do you mean "win thebreakup",<br/>old-timey inventor?
What our 21st president,<br/>Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say,
is that in every breakup there are<br/>winners and a losers.
It's not a competition.
Now, your 80-day balloon race around<br/>the world, that was a competition.
That's my wife.
Of course it's<br/>a competition, Lil.
How else do you explain...<br/>what's his name?
Gael.
I'm sorry, Gayle?
Gael.
Kyle?
Gael.
Girl?
It's pronounced "guy-el."
It means "joyful."
That is why I live<br/>my life by bringing joy,
good energy<br/>and happiness to others.
Especially those<br/>less fortunate that I.
I'm sorry, so it's Gayle?
What a jerk.
I don't go to your stupid country and<br/>try to seduce women with my sexy accent.
That's a great point,<br/>Persian nightclub owner.
Oh, and he's a masseuse.
With a massage,
everything is connected.
I can touch your foot,<br/>cleanse your kidney.
I can touch your earlobe,<br/>and slow your heartbeat.
One time, I used warm water<br/>to make a guy pee.
Of course, I didn't<br/>make a career out of it.
Career?
Such an American idea.
My career is living.
Windsurfing.
Making love.
Sometimes at the same time.
How?<br/>How would one do that exactly?
Seriously, don't giggle.<br/>Tell me.
Not possible. You cannot have sex<br/>on a windsurfing board.
- How do you know?<br/>- Glad you asked, Lily.
I have crafted a list<br/>of every vehicle...
land-based, aquatic and airborne...
in which/on which it's<br/>possible to have sex.
And of those 33 vehicles,<br/>I have had sex in/on 31.
Windsurfing board,<br/>not on the list, not possible.
Oh, P.S., in orderto hit 33,
all I need is bobsled<br/>and the Apollo 11 space capsule.
To get that last one, you'd have<br/>to break into the Smithsonian.
This conversation never happened.
All right, you're suited up,<br/>I'm bearded down.
- Let's get out there and win this thing.<br/>- Yes!
You guys, have fun<br/>on your double date.
Oh, for the hundredth time,<br/>I'm sorry, there was a lull.
And then we fell asleep on the beach<br/>while counting the stars.
Do you want to have<br/>dinner with me? Uh, us?
There was no lull.
- You just think he's incredibly hot.<br/>- No, I don't!
Not incredibly.
It's a little hard to believe<br/>how hot he is.
But, I mean, she's not<br/>serious about him.
The girl never marries the hot guy.
Well, you did.
I'm one of the lucky few.
Lily, Ted is our best friend,<br/>so let's get something straight:
Male Gayle is not hot.
He's not our friend.<br/>Don't even look at him.
Just... no eye contact.
So that night, as Lily and Marshall<br/>did their best to hate Gael...
Hey, Robin. Gael.
Robin pulled me aside<br/>to check in.
Now, I'm sure<br/>she meant the best,
but she said the worst.
I just want to make sure<br/>you're okay with this.
"I just want to make sure<br/>you're okay with this"?
Damn it! I can't believe she's<br/>the one that gets to say that.
She's winning, isn't she?
Not for long.<br/>Okay, pep talk.
Take a knee.
Ted, tonight we're going to get you<br/>someone way hotter than Robin.
Okay, Robin's a ten.
Fine, we'll get you a 12.
Or, you know...<br/>two sixes.
Failing that, four threes.
And break glass<br/>in case of emergency,
we'll go to Staten Island,<br/>I'll get you 12 ones.
Ted, my boy, I am going to<br/>re-teach you how...
- Amy.<br/>- Ted.
Barney.
Ted, we are back!
Up here.
Up high.
Fivin' it up five-style!
I'm sorry this is<br/>all so weird.
Weird, why would it be weird?
Because you used to date<br/>our best friend or because my wife
thinks your new boyfriend<br/>is incredibly hot?
I do not! Shut up!<br/>Oh, my God!
- I just hope Ted's okay.<br/>- Hmm.
I hate to see you so tense.
I mean, we had a really<br/>clean break up, you know?
We really acted like adults,<br/>so the last thing... oh!
Gael, are you a properly<br/>licensed massage therapist?
What?
Are you legally certified by some type<br/>of governing entity?
I train for three years at<br/>an institute in Buenos Aires.
I have a card.<br/>I can show you.
Is the card laminated?
- What do you mean "laminated"?<br/>- Covered in protective plastic.
- Oh, yes.<br/>- Damn it.
He checks out.
Ted. Ted.
- Ted. Ted.<br/>- What!?
Let's bail, this place is dead.
Yeah, you're right.<br/>We're both totally striking out.
Exactly, plus,<br/>we're on a tight schedule.
I've got this entire evening<br/>perfectly planned out... spoiler alert:
our last stop is an after hours club so<br/>after hours, it's three days from now.
What up.
Are you blind?<br/>I'm making out with a 12.
- I am winning.<br/>- Yeah, but I didn't get to help.
So you're saying<br/>you want me to throw away
a super hot girl just because<br/>you didn't help me get her?
Apology accepted.<br/>Let's go.
- Who's the suit?<br/>- This is Barney.
- Barney, Amy.<br/>- I'm not gonna remember that.
Now, if you'll exse me,<br/>random chick from earlier tonight,
as you shall henceforth be known,<br/>Ted and I have a schedule to keep.
Well, you can check off 8:54, dress up<br/>like a dork and bother the cool kids.
Beat it, nerd.
Wow. Wow.<br/>Great stuff, Tommy Lee.
See, what you don't understand is<br/>I'm Ted's wingman.
It's a sacred bond, much stronger<br/>than any... They're making out again.
Massage therapist.
And you know what, "Gayle"?
Your piece of chicken<br/>looks a little tense to me.
Oh, oh, does that<br/>feel good, Mr. Chicken?
Well, guess what?
I didn't wash my hands.
Got him.
Lily!
We carry so much ancient emotion<br/>in our neck and shoulders.
Things we should have<br/>let go of years ago.
I forgive you, Mom.
Lily, we are Ted's best friends.<br/>Our job is to hate that guy.
Oh, yeah,<br/>that's what I was doing.
I was just building him up so
a few minutes later,<br/>I could totally cut him down.
Weren't you wearing a bra?
The night was going great.
Amy was cool and dangerous.
She found a friend for Barney.
She even paid for drinks...<br/>sort of.
They know us here.<br/>You're gonna get us in trouble.
Tell me something. Do you ask your<br/>tailor to leave extra room in the crotch
for your huge vagina?
You... your vagina...
Ted, this chick is crazy.<br/>We're leaving.
Good idea.<br/>Let's all go back to my place.
Your place? Thanks but no thanks,<br/>1994 Courtney Love.
I have a hot tub.
Okay, this is<br/>actually pretty nice.
I like your tatts.
Thanks, you can play<br/>with them if you want.
They're a hundred percent real.
No, your tatts... toos,<br/>your tattoos.
Thanks.
- You should get one.<br/>- Wrong!
Ted has a classic<br/>clean*
that never goes out of style<br/>season after season, burn.
Yeah? Well, I think he<br/>would look hot with some ink.
- No, he wouldn't.<br/>- Yes, he would.
No, he wouldn't.
I'm ready to do anything<br/>you want by the way. Anything.
Right now.
Ted, who are you gonna side<br/>with on this tattoo thing?
I think I'd look<br/>way hot with some ink.
- Yeah, you would.<br/>- Yeah.
Oh, my God!<br/>Tyler?
Mommy! Daddy!<br/>She's back!
Damn it, they're supposed<br/>to be in the Hamptons. Run!
Sorry. I used to nanny for<br/>those jerks before they fired me.
- So unfair.<br/>- Unfair?
I wouldn't let you take care of the<br/>imaginary kids I make up
to score with single moms.
That's it, Ted.<br/>We're going home.
Ted?
Ted, you okay?
Hello, Ted.
Robin and I are about to make fantastic<br/>aquatic sex on this windsurfing board.
And I just want to make sure<br/>you're okay with this.
- Okay, how do we this?<br/>- I think your leg goes up, up...
- Okay, how about if I, um...<br/>- No, mine...
I'm okay.
In fact, here's<br/>how okay I am.
- I'm getting a tattoo.<br/>- You're not getting a tattoo,
it's not you.
Ted, you are heading<br/>down a dark path.
That dark path<br/>is my driveway.
But you need a plan<br/>and you need a wingman!
This is so going<br/>in my blog!
Want to have sex?
Okay.
And underneath,<br/>it should say, "I win."
And then it should have<br/>flames coming out the bottom.
Fire!
We should start a fire.
After this maybe.
Oh, man, this is<br/>going to be legend... Wait for it.
And that's all I remember.
The next morning,<br/>I woke up alone, back home.
Hey, buddy, how<br/>was your night?
You know, it was great.
I met this crazy girl,<br/>I almost got a tattoo.
Don't worry.<br/>I didn't, but it was...
It was amazing.
I think it's safe to say,<br/>I am winning this breakup.
Look.
Oh, my God.
- What?<br/>- Nothing.
This J. Crew catalog.
Who brings two Golden<br/>Retrievers in a canoe?
- We got to call Barney.<br/>- Way ahead of you.
Hey, guys, what's<br/>the big emergency?
Oh, and B the W:<br/>I am never speaking to Ted again.
Really? Never?
Not even if, say,<br/>butterflies flew out of his ass?
What?
Ted? Could you grab me<br/>the fondue pot?
He has no idea.
Mm-hmm.<br/>And up we go.
Thank you.
What?
- Ted?<br/>- Mm?
I came here<br/>this morning because...
- I want to apologize.<br/>- Apology accepted, Barney.
As you can see, I do just fine on my own.<br/>I don't need a baby-sitter.
See, all this time, I thought you needed<br/>a wingman to fly, but the truth is, you...
you've got your<br/>own wings now.
Since you and Robin split,<br/>you've been gestating.
Growing in your cocoon.
And last night...<br/>...you burst out of that cocoon
like a...<br/>like a majestic, uh...
Gosh, what is it that<br/>comes out of a cocoon?
I was always bad at science.
He's going to say it!
A butterfly?
- What?<br/>- Nothing, buddy.
Ow! Why did that hurt so...?
Oh, my God!
- I have a tattoo!<br/>- Oh, that's not a tattoo.
That, dear boy,<br/>is a tramp stamp.
A tramp stamp.
You know, a ho tag.<br/>Ass antlers.
A Panama City license plate.
And suddenly,<br/>it all came back to me.
...dary!
Legendary!
Man, I am so winning<br/>this breakup.
I just broke up<br/>with my boyfriend Steve.
He was totally annoying.
He was, like, "I think you're the one,<br/>I want to marry you."
What a wuss.
Do you think<br/>exes can be friends?
Yeah, sure. I mean,<br/>we're still friends, right, Steve?
Hey, your name is Steve.
And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve.
What are the odds of that...?
Wait.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Give me this.
- Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.<br/>- Maybe you should try club soda.
Damn it, it really hurts. I need,<br/>like, some ointment or something.
Spanish massage oil.
Spanish massage oil?
What happened here last night?
Last night got weird.
Feel the emotions release.
Think I just got over<br/>being chunky in the ninth grade.
You're beautiful.
I am beautiful.
Experience your food.
Try the mango.
Okay, that's enough of the fruit.
We're sorry, Ted.<br/>It'll never happen again.
It meant nothing to us.<br/>It just felt really, really, really good.
I can't even look<br/>at you two right now.
He got a tramp stamp.
All right, first of all,<br/>this isn't one of those,
"I came all the way over here<br/>because I want you back" things.
There'll be no startling<br/>confession of love,
no sweet indie rock song that<br/>swells up we're about to kiss,
- none of that crap. Got it?<br/>- Okay.
Good.<br/>Now, here's the thing.
It sucks that you came back from Argentina<br/>with someone as awesome as Gael.
And I know I have no<br/>right to be upset at you.
We're broken up, life<br/>goes on, whatever.
But you know what?<br/>We-We never did this.
We-We had this polite breakup<br/>with no irrational yelling, and...
and that's just wrong!
So, I'm going to yell<br/>irrationally for a little while,
and you're just going to have to<br/>stand there and deal with it, okay?
- If you feel like you need to do that...<br/>- I think I do!
I really think I do!<br/>So now I'm yelling!
- You shaved.<br/>- I did!
- I liked the beard.<br/>- I liked it, too,
but it was getting kind of hot!
Maybe in the winter,<br/>I'll grow it back out!
Okay, I'm done.
I know it was weird<br/>showing up with Gael.
I'm sorry.
Look, us breaking up,<br/>it was the right thing.
But it took some time to<br/>get over you, you know?
I-I'm still getting over you.
But you? You were over it the minute<br/>they started the in-flight movie.
Over it?!
My first three days in Argentina,<br/>I cried my eyes out.
I missed you so much.
I wanted to go and prove how<br/>adventurous I am, but the truth is...
it was really lonely.
And that's why Gael happened.
You weren't trying to win the breakup?
I was trying to survive it.
See, look, that all sounds good,
and we'll still be friends<br/>and move on, but...
did he have to be so hot?
- The guy's an Adonis.<br/>- He's not an Adonis.
He's the Cadillac of rebound guys.<br/>Marshall has a crush on him!
- The guy's perfect.<br/>- He's not perfect.
Oh, come on.<br/>He's hot,
he wind surfs,<br/>he massages things.
Name one way I'm<br/>better than that guy.
You're bigger.
Don't patronize me. If anything,<br/>he may even be a little bit taller.
No. Ted... you're bigger.
I win!
Kids, I can't remember exactly<br/>what helped me get through
the whole Robin-Gael incident.
I'm sure that it was something<br/>profound and meaningful,
and not at all macho and petty,
but after that,<br/>I was back on my feet.
And what followed was<br/>a new era in my life,
a crazy time<br/>unlike anything that ce before.
It's funny looking back<br/>at those days,
knowing now exactly<br/>what I was heading towards.
And what was heading<br/>towards me.
Go for Barney.
Hey, man, it's Marshall.
Check your e-mail.<br/>Sent you something.
- What is it?<br/>- Just a new Web site.
What does this mean?
Ma-Marshall?
No.
No!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Different, not different?
It's the same. Mostly.
Except I think I might<br/>be getting carpal tunnel.
My hand keeps cramping up.
I thought the whole point<br/>of getting married was
that you didn't have to do that anymore.
No, it's from writing all the thank you notes.
Mostly.<br/>Yeah.
You're writing constantly.
There's forms we<br/>have to sign, our death folders,
thank you notes.<br/>Whoa, whoa.
What are death folders?
It's this thing they recommend you do
in case one spouse dies unexpectedly.
It's all the information<br/>your spouse might need
all in one convenient location<br/>Yeah.
Account info,<br/>important addresses,
a letter to the other person.
All that stuff.
I'll get the next round.
I am such a jerk.
Yeah.
Wait, why?
I didn't know that I was<br/>supposed to write a letter.
All Lily's gonna find
in that folder are a bunch<br/>of bank statements
and a funny list of things to do<br/>with my ashes.
- Marshall brownies. Number six.<br/>- Yeah.
Oh, God, I am a bad husband.
No, uh, no, I'll just write,
I'll write Lily a letter<br/>tonight, everything'll be fine.
That's right.
Unless...
- you die between now and then.<br/>- Ooh.
- But... come on, that's never gonna happen.<br/>- Yes!
If there's one thing we can<br/>state with absolute certainty
it's that Marshall Eriksen<br/>is not going to die
before writing that letter.
No way at all.
In fact, I dare God to smite down<br/>this perfectly healthy...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
I get it.
Okay, you guys know<br/>I'm a little superstitious,
and you guys are trying to freak me out.
Well, guess what?<br/>It didn't work.
So, there.
You guys are jerks!
Kids, after Robin and I broke up,
she needed some time away.
Away from her normal home,<br/>her normal life,
and it turns out,<br/>her normal self.
I was just so uptight<br/>in New York, you know?
I mean down here everybody<br/>shares everything.
It's like we're all one big<br/>shimmering ball of positive energy.
I wonder if anyone's ever<br/>thought that before.
Here. Eat.
If we run out of fish, I will<br/>catch more with my hands.
A drum circle!
They're different every time.
Let's go watch!
And here I am at the drum circle.
Whoa, are you topless?
Ted, check this out.
Seen 'em.
Wow, it seems like a great trip.
Oh, it was.
I feel like the Robin who left
is not the same Robin<br/>who came back, you know.
Wow, there's a lot of nude people in here.
You haven't changed,<br/>Scherbatsky.
You're a sophisticated,<br/>scotch-swilling,
cigar-smoking,<br/>red-meat-eating,
gun-toting New Yorker.
Just shoes and a shirt.
That's a look.
What you are not is a massage-giving,<br/>windsurfing, bongo-playing,
teetotaling, vegan,<br/>peacenik, hippy
like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael.
Back me up here, Ted.
I'm just happy Robin's happy.
- Thank you.<br/>- Man, this is like a
"Where's Waldo" of exposed genitalia.
Except that it's really easy to find Waldo.
I'm evolved...
and I'm enjoying living my life
a little bit closer to the way Gael
- and I did in Argentina.<br/>- Please.
Vacation romances have an expiration date.
Gael's got a "best if<br/>banged by" sticker on him.
Once your romance starts to stink,<br/>you'll dump his ass down the drain
like sour milk and go back to being<br/>"Unevolved Robin," the one we actually like.
Back me up here, Ted.
I'm just happy Robin's happy.
I'm telling you,<br/>within three days...
Ooh, here he comes.<br/>Switched to big words.
Within a triad of solar periods,
you'll recognize your dearth
of compatibility with your paramour
and conclude your association.
My journey was transformative.
And I reassert my commitment to both<br/>the aforementioned paramour
and the philosophies he espouses.
What are we talking of?
othell?
This is all gonna return to<br/>masticate you in the gluteals.
Support my hypothesis, Ted.
I'm just jubilant my former<br/>paramour's jubilant.
To write the letter
he hoped Lily would never have to read.
"My dearest,<br/>sweetest, Lily pad.
"Let this letter be a small beacon,
"a tiny firefly to help light your way
"through the years ahead.
"My love for you persists
"higher than the Himalayas.
Deeper than a Scottish loch."
"If I died under suspicious<br/>circumstances,"then beware.
"Trust no oneNot even Ted."
"Especially not Ted."
"Know that I'll always<br/>be there in your heart"whenever you need me,
"and that my love for you will never die.
"Love...
your marshmallow."
"M.
"ATM pin code: 5-4-5-9.
"Teacher's pension account: A-3-9-3-2.
"Cancel Vogue.
L."
My windsurfing board...
it had floated away.
And the shark...
he was getting closer.<br/>They say to escape
you punch a shark in the nose.
But I said, "Brother shark,
we are both children from the same<br/>Earth mother."
And that's all I remember until the hospital.
That guy.<br/>Yeah.
That guy.
Look at how easy he has it.
You and me, we have<br/>to bend over backwards
to get a woman to, well,<br/>bend over backwards.
But that guy...
Every woman in the bar is hanging
on his every slightly mispronounced word.
And why?
He's better looking than us.
No.
Because he's from out of town.<br/>Mmm.
With and accent and an innocent smile,
you don't even have to try.<br/>Yeah.
Plus automatic out, you're leaving in<br/>a couple of days.
God, I wish we were tourists.<br/>Yeah.
Actually...
You know where I've been<br/>meaning to visit?
Okay, okay, we're from a small<br/>town in the south of France.
Our plane leaves Sunday morning.
Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.<br/>Hate to bother you.
We seem to be a little bit lost.
Would you happen to know which street
the Statue of Liberty's on?
Actually,<br/>it's on its own island.
Oh!<br/>Oh, it's right...
Ah.<br/>Thank you very...
Uh, my name is, uh,<br/>Ignatius Peabody Nobel.
From East Westerton,<br/>Missouri.
And this is my friend, Ted.
Hi, um, I'm Colleen.
Hi, Colleen.<br/>This is Lindsay.
Hi, Lindsay.
So, hey,:you-you-you ladies,<br/>been awful nice to us.
What do you say...
Ah, never mind.<br/>No...
No, what is it?
Well...
it's just we're leaving Sunday morning.
It sure would be nice to have some<br/>real New Yorkers show us around.
Yeah.
Well, we're busy tonight, but...
maybe tomorrow afternoon?
After lunch?
Well, hotdog!
Should we...
you want to just meet here
in front of Mac...<br/>MacLaren's Pub?
It's kind of a lame bar, but sure.
Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.
It's pretty lame.
I think it's cool.
We'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar
a lot of cool people would hang out at.
Okay, all right.
So, Gael, huh?<br/>Mmm.
Still going strong?
Yeah, it's great.<br/>Amazing, fantastic, awesome.
Ooh, that's one too many.
What's going on?
Well, now that I'm home,
I'm finding myself getting annoyed
at things that I loved on vacation.
Here, taste.
Experience your food.
Oh. So good.
Here, taste.
Experience your food.
Ooh, sofa,<br/>ooh, sofa. Sofa, sofa, oh.
Ooh.<br/>We're alone now.
I must have you.
Ooh.<br/>I must have you.
Laptop, laptop, laptop!
And you know what else?
I'm still finding sand everywhere.
I mean, we haven't been<br/>to the beach since Argentina.
Where is all coming from?
maybe you are going back to the person<br/>you were before the trip.
But I don't want to.
I was so happy down there.
No, you know what?
I'm done complaining.
I'm evolving.
Just gonna go with the flow.
Wow.
Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower.
Okay.
Okay, old Robin would have been<br/>like, dude, ocupado.
But now, you know what,<br/>I'm cool with it.
Pee it up.
In fact,
when you're done, why don't you<br/>come in here and join me?
Don't mind if I do, love.
Gael, there's some weird du...
Hello.<br/>Hey!
Good news!
I made some new traveling friends today,
and they will staying with us<br/>how do you say
indefinitely!
Will you sign this thank you note?
Wow.
Both sides.
You wrote on both sides of a<br/>thank you note to my third cousin
for a blender that you haven't<br/>even taken out of the box.
Wow, that's...
It's a really nice blender.<br/>Well, if you love
that blender so much,<br/>why don't you just marry it.
I can't.<br/>I married you.
That's how we got the blender.
What's wrong?
Nothing.<br/>Nothing's wrong.
What could be wrong?
Except that when you die<br/>I'm gonna find out
that your parting words<br/>to comfort me for all eternity
were "Cancel Vogue."
How can you open my letter?
That was not a letter.
It was barely even a text message.
Next time you write something
that short, at least have<br/>the courtesy to make it rhyme.
Marshall, wait.
This was our first fight as a married couple.
Oh, baby.
Oh...<br/>Oh.
This is our favorite restaurant in the city.
Yes, I'm sure this is the best
of their 57 "spudtacular"<br/>east coast locations.
- I'm going to run to the restroom.<br/>- I'm gonna go, too.
This is the easiest date ever.
You know what I'm gonna try next?
A knock, knock joke.
Easiest?<br/>Somehow we have managed
to find the two lamest<br/>New Yorkers of all time.
Ted, Ted, Ted.<br/>Dude, I am looking at you.
What?<br/>Right.
Stay with me.
We are on the cusp of moving<br/>from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers.
Ay-o.
All right, Ignatius, one more hour.<br/>Nice.
Nice. Hey, nice.<br/>Hey...
Hey, our friends invited us to a party.
You guys want to come along?<br/>Knock, knock.
Who's there?<br/>Yes, we do.
Quick announcement.
I am so glad that you're here,<br/>fellow travelers.
A couple rules...
not even rules.
Let's call them guidelines<br/>for harmonious living.
Guideline for harmonious living
number one...
the kitchen sink is for dishes,<br/>the toilet is for pee-pee.
G.F.H.L.
number two...
marijuana is illegal in the United States,
even when baked into a blueberry muffin
that someone might mistakenly<br/>eat for breakfast
right before they leave for<br/>their job as a TV newscaster.
"This just in: look at my hand,<br/>how weird is my hand?"
is not an appropriate thing to say on the air.
and Number 3
and number 3 is please<br/>keep the noise to a minimum
I have to take a nap.
I'm still pretty baked.
Everything's so bright,<br/>even at night.
No wonder the city never sleeps.
Hey, if we're going north,
why did we cross over the FDR?
We should have taken the Hudson.
Now he knows all the streets.
Someone's been watching<br/>too many Steinfeld reruns.
Where are we even going anyway?
148th and Brook Avenue.
A hundred... in the South Bronx<br/>at this time of night?
We're going to get killed.
Ted, I think these local New Yorkers
know more about the city<br/>than we do, so relax.
We're in very capable hands.
There were three of them,<br/>at least two guns...
they took all our money.
Well, I only had traveler's checks.
Hey, babe.
I've been thinking about our fight.
Yes?
I'm really, really...
surprised that you haven't<br/>apologized to me yet.
Wow, you really want to open this up again.
Oh, I forgot,<br/>you open everything up,
even if you're not supposed to<br/>until I'm dead.
You know that this is important to me.
Why won't you just write the letter?
Because I can't bear the<br/>thought of not being with you,
not even for long enough<br/>to write you a stupid letter.
Really?
Yes, really.
Plus, I know as soon as I write it,
you're just going to open<br/>it up and read it again.
Lily, I won't,<br/>I promise.
Okay.
I'll write you a letter for my death folder.
Do you mind, um,<br/>maybe slipping
in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?
I tell you what.
How about I make it all dirty stuff
and slip in a little clean stuff?
You're the best.
And maybe a couple of Polaroids?
Come on,<br/>let's get out of here.
This night's a disaster.<br/>What?!
This night couldn't have gone any better.
We just survived a mugging.
You know what that means.
"Thank God we're alive" sex.
"Thank God we're alive" sex.
It's even better
than "I can't believe you<br/>just proposed to me" sex,
Ted, please, we are so close.
I've never worked this hard<br/>for anything in my life.
Whew!
Wow, I think we all need to go<br/>back to our place and recover.
Yeah.
I just want to celebrate the fact<br/>that we survived.
You know?<br/>Mm-hmm.
Me, too.
So where do you live?
What, West Village?<br/>Close.
West Orange.
- West Orange, New Jersey?<br/>- Yeah.
You guys live in New Jersey,<br/>not New York?
Theodore.<br/>Yep.
New Jersey?<br/>Teddy. Yeah, but don't worry,
it's pretty much New York.<br/>Oh.
No.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.<br/>New Jersey is not "pretty much new york."
You are not "pretty much new yorkers."
And how would you know?<br/>Because I live here.
That's right,<br/>I live here.
Yes, we're full of crap.
Yes, we pretended to be from out of town
so we could sleep with you<br/>and leave in the morning.
But you know what's even worse than that?
Saying you're a New Yorker<br/>when you're not.
Because this is the<br/>greatest city in the world
and you have to earn the right<br/>to call yourself a New Yorker.
So why don't you girls crawl into the open<br/>sewer pipe you call the Holland Tunnel
and flush yourselves back<br/>to "pretty much New York"?
Because I will do a lot to get laid,
but I am not going to New Jersey!
You're not from Missouri?
Well, I will be a monkey's unc...
Ew.<br/>Right.
Can we get a ride?
Hey, um, sir,
can we get a ride, too?
Newark, born and raised.
Can you please keep it down?
What happened to you, man?
You said you wouldn't<br/>change, but look at you.
No more tan,<br/>no more beaded braids,
no more lush,
untamed forest of leg and armpit hair.
You're back at work.
What gives?
Well, I have to have a job.
"I have to have a job."
God, that's so American.
I'm Canadian.<br/>You know that.
What about the important things<br/>like making your own jewelry
and lying on the beach
and thinking about peace?
God, don't you care about<br/>thinking about peace?
Wow.
I just realized something.
That you've lost your way.
No, that you really suck.
You're boring and lame
and you're getting sand everywhere.
Seriously, where is<br/>all the sand coming from?
You're not the real me.
All you are is me on vacation
trying to get away from a break-up.
Don't you remember Argentina?
Don't you want to go back?
What are you doing?
Shh...
Let this happen.
All right, everyone out.
I said everyone out!
All right, we're leaving,<br/>we're leaving, okay.
Michael Moore was so right<br/>about Americans.
I'm Canadian!
Robin, you okay?
No, I'm not.
Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you<br/>about something.
After they broke up,<br/>Robin went back to being Robin.
Welcome home, Scherbatsky.
Oh, good to be back.
Although it's weird.
Vacation Robin popped into<br/>my dream again last night.
Listening.
This time we went all the way.
Tell you one thing.
She made me sandy<br/>but that's what I like
Okay, I'm done.
But I really don't want you<br/>reading this unless...
you know, something happens.
Can you swear to me you won't open it?
Totally. What does it say?
Marshall, I'm serious.
Okay.
I promise I won't, I won't<br/>open that until you're dead.
Okay.
And through 22 wonderful years<br/>of marriage,
Marshall kept his promise
until November 1 of last year when, sadly...
"Busted! I knew you'd read this.
You suck, Marshall,<br/>you totally suck."
That's it?
I suck?
Lily.<br/>Yes, you suck.
You said you wouldn't read it
and you did.<br/>Well, you didn't keep your promise either.
I don't see any dirty pictures in here.
Oh, fine,
I'll take the dirty pictures.
I don't want 'em now.
What is that supposed to mean?
What?!
Nothing.
nothing.
You're beautiful.
I would love the photos. Have I<br/>told you how beautiful you look?

[<div class="full-script">Kids I know you think you<br/>have ever heard of a story
but there is some stories you tell<br/>and some stories you don't
Oh, my God!...
- Oh, my God...<br/>- Use your words, Ted.
- Okay. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.<br/>- The belt?
- The belt.<br/>- But that's impossible
Yes!
- Advantage... Ericksen.<br/>- Don't get cocky.
- Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.<br/>- "Fortnight."
- British words are so cool.<br/>- Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs?
All right.<br/>We're ready. Let's hit it.
We can't go. Tournament.
What? We agreed.<br/>I suited up...
You take too long to get ready
What are you talking about?<br/>I got the low maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.
Yeah, which takes an hour and a half<br/>of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.
And then he starts on his hair.
Ace!
- Look, are we going or not?<br/>- Just go without us.
We'll be there in five minutes.
Really?
- Yes! Yes!<br/>- All right,
I'm going down to the bar.
I'm ordering three beers.<br/>I'll see you guys in
five minutes.<br/>Three beers,
five minutes.
Thanks for lending me<br/>these boots.
Where'd you get them from?
This store in the Village<br/>had one of those crazy sales.
It was a footwear<br/>feeding frenzy.
I saw it first!
You just made the list, bitch!
So many questions.
Firstly, what do you think<br/>would happen
if a guy walked into that store<br/>wearing a suit of boots?
You look fantastic in them,<br/>Robin.
But don't you think they're<br/>a little high for that dress?
Well, that's the point:<br/>it's to hide that fact
that I haven't<br/>shaved my legs.
I've begun<br/>a strict no-shave policy
for the first three dates.
It's all about self-control.
If I don't shave,<br/>I must behave.
FYI: It doesn't matter, baby.
Guys just want to get<br/>on the green.
They don't mind going<br/>through the rough.
Shh-clackey!
Stinson.
All right,<br/>the beers are here.
Yeah, we're not going<br/>to make it.
Oh, come on! We agreed...
Did Marshall take his pants off?
Yeah, pants are off.
I need the freedom and mobility<br/>that only underwear can provide.
Cheerio!
Fine.
I don't need friends.
I got you guys.
You guys are my friends,
my cold refreshing friends.
I'm talking to beer.
Ted? Trudy.
Trudy.
Oh, my God. I haven't<br/>seen you since...
I slept with you and then<br/>climbed down the fire escape.
That was you?
I'm kidding.<br/>I was super-wasted.
These are not all for me.
No, I was going to call you,<br/>but I was so embarrassed.
You were embarrassed?
I was like,<br/>"I really like this guy,
"and now I'm climbing out<br/>his window,
and I forgot my underwear..."
Those were yours?
God, I thought<br/>they felt kind of tight.
I'm kidding.<br/>I don't wear underwear.
Ladies' underwear.
Often.
Ah! Again, I'm kidding.
I'm so glad I ran into you.
I know. Do you want to...?<br/>Trudy?!
No way!
Oh, my God!<br/>Rachel, how are you?
Ted, this is Rachel.
Hi!
Kappa Epsilon Gamma!<br/>Kappa Epsilon Gamma!
Whoo!<br/>Whoo!
Wait, let me guess.<br/>You guys met in prison.
No! We were<br/>sorority sisters.
And best friends forever<br/>all sophomore year.
When we weren't<br/>at each other's throats.
We could be so competitive.
Uh, but that's<br/>all behind us now.
Hey, mista! Hey, mista!
Stay away from my sista!<br/>Stay away from my sista!
Whoo!<br/>Whoo!
We have so much<br/>catching up to do.
Okay. Are you going<br/>to Stacey's wedding?
Oh, it's off. Apparently,<br/>he's into dudes.
Nah! Again?!<br/>That's like her third one.
I know!
Well, beers,<br/>what do you want to do?
We could stay here...
or I know this other place<br/>called "My Belly."
So, Trudy and I<br/>got a table.
Oh, that's cool. I was going<br/>to get out of here anyway.
I'm really tired.
I want you to stay.
Tired of people who fold early,<br/>'cause I am wide awake!
Okay, guys... be cool.
Aah!
You've been<br/>vanquished, old bean.
That's 'cause<br/>you distracted me.
You've been hanging crumpet<br/>ever since the third set.
Ah... Stinson.
I've got a situation.
Trudy is here... you know,<br/>from the pineapple incident?
Oh, you mean the girl<br/>that chalked your pool cue
and then snuck down<br/>the fire escape?
Respect.
So, we're hitting it off<br/>and then her friend shows up
and they're<br/>kind of competitive.
HJI think the new girl's<br/>kind of into me.
So you now have two on the line?
And I don't know<br/>which one to go for.
Go for the new girl!
Given the choice, always party<br/>with Dr. Strangelove.
New girl?<br/>What new girl?
Two girls are allegedly vying
for Ted's affections,<br/>and I think...
Oh, you don't know<br/>what you're talking about.
Give it to me.
Are they friends?
Yeah. Uh, no... I-I don't know.<br/>They're old sorority sisters.
Are they Betas?
Because they're all sluts,<br/>and you can tell them right now
I didn't want to be<br/>in their sorority anyway.
They're Kappas, and...
I think I can score<br/>with one of them.
I don't know which one,
and if I chose wrong,<br/>I lose them both.
Okay, well, don't worry.
I'll-I'll come down<br/>and help you figure it out.
I thought we were in<br/>for the evening?
That's what I thought about your<br/>bangers and mash down there,
but I guess we're both wrong,<br/>guv'na.
Hey.<br/>Oh, Ted. Okay...
Settle an argument.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Is it stealing if you go out<br/>with someone's boyfriend
after they've broken up?
Well, that's<br/>very complicated...
See?! He agrees with me.
You're such a little man-thief.
You're the man-thief,<br/>man-thief.
Oh, somebody should lock<br/>loyou girls up.
You're so funny.
I think Ted is funny.
Really?<br/>I think Ted is hilarious.
I am never not wearing<br/>a suit again.
Hello?
It's me. I'm at the bar.
Don't look.<br/>Just call me "Mom."
Uh, hey, Mom.<br/>How's Dad's... colon?
What?<br/>What's the matter with you?
Anyway, both of these girls<br/>are into you; take your pick.
They are? Are you sure?<br/>Yes, of course.
They're playing with their hair<br/>and touching your arm.
Classic green light.
Are you positive?
Oh, that is so fascinating.
So what happened?
Well, after 18<br/>hours of surgery,
I closed,<br/>and, thankfully,
both girls just celebrated<br/>their second birthday.
Wow. Gosh, separating<br/>conjoined twins,
that must be<br/>the most amazing feeling.
True, but now the parents<br/>don't know what to do
with their huge supply<br/>of four-legged overalls.
That is so funny.
You're so funny.
Positive.<br/>They both want you bad.
It's a clearance sale<br/>and you're the boots, baby.
Oh, it's Robin.<br/>Good luck.
Bye, Mom.
That's my mom.
Hello?
Bring me a razor.
What about the no-shave rule?
What happened<br/>to your convictions?
They've been surgically removed<br/>by Dr. Awesome.
No, I'm not doing it.
The whole point to not shaving<br/>was to...
Lily, please!<br/>He's really cute,
and I really like him,<br/>and he's got a British accent.
I'm on my way.
So this college boyfriend,<br/>who won him?
Neither of us.
He left.<br/>Junior year abroad.
It's really<br/>too bad, 'cause...
there was that one thing<br/>we wanted to do.
We were<br/>going to do...
but we never did.
Why? Wait, what were you guys<br/>going to do but never did?
No, it's too<br/>embarrassing.
You tell him.<br/>No, you tell him.
No, I don't care<br/>if you don't care.
Well, I don't care. I just...
Nobody cares! Just say it.
Why don't we tell him together.
Okay.
On three.
One...
Well, he's right:<br/>it's a dead heat.
...two...
Neither one is<br/>giving ground.
I could not tell<br/>who was the third wheel.
...three.
It's a tricycle.
No way, no way, no way!
What's happening?
It's a tricycle.
No way, no way, no way.
It's a tricycle.
Well, I'll just say it<br/>right now.
All sorority girls are sluts.
Put him on speaker.
So what you're saying<br/>to us right now
is that you have<br/>a shot at the belt?
Wait-wait-wait.<br/>What belt?
Ho<br/>Well, Barney and I have
this running joke that the first<br/>guy to actually pull this off
would "win"<br/>the championship belt.
Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt,<br/>right?
Behold...
You actually bought a belt.
That's right. It's resplendent.
Come on, it was<br/>just a thing we said.
We were kidding around.
I never kid.
Remember you said if I ever<br/>slept with that girl
from Days of Our Lives,<br/>I'd be the king?
Well...
Why wasn't I told<br/>about the belt?
I could go for the belt.
If Lily would've died before me,<br/>then I could ride the tricycle.
If I died, I would just come<br/>back and haunt your penis.
Guys, come on! Help me out.<br/>What do I do?
All right, Ted, if you're<br/>going to go for the belt,
then the bylaws require me<br/>to ask the following questions:
One: Is the aggregate age<br/>of all participants under 83?
Yes.
Two: Is the aggregate weight<br/>of all participants
under 400 pounds?
Yes.
Theodore Mosby...
are you paying these women?
What? No.
Ted...
No. Look, I got to go.<br/>They're going to think
I inherited my dad's imaginary<br/>bathroom issues.
Oh, are you guys leaving?
Well, it is getting pretty late.
Right. Well, well, it's been...
Maybe we could all go<br/>listen to that Wilco CD
you talked about before.
Great! I have it right upstairs.
It's in my apartment upstairs.<br/>Let's go upstairs.
I'm sorry. Where was<br/>your apartment again?
Ha, that's funny. I love that.
You should tell more jokes<br/>in my apartment upstenrs.
Scenario #12:<br/>We're in a horrific car crash.
You die. I'm left paralyzed.
Two sexy nurses,<br/>with a six-pack of wine coolers,
sneak into my room<br/>late at night.
I try to blink at them in Morse code.
"Please, don't. I love my dead wife."
But they're medical<br/>professionals,
and I got to think, somehow,<br/>they're saving my life.
Fine. Sleep with your nurses.
Tonight you ride the unicycle.
I already did this morning.
Hello.
Lily, I have pounded three<br/>cappuccinos waiting for you.
Pretty soon,<br/>I won't have to shave...
the hair is going to vibrate<br/>off my legs.
I'm sorry, I can't leave now.
Lily, he can't see<br/>my legs like this.
I look like a Turkish lesbian.
There's, um, a pharmacy<br/>across the street.
Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?
No, but 50 will.
Hold on. Ted's texting me.
"We're combing up-sars."
"Combing up-sars."<br/>What does that mean?
It means they're<br/>coming upstairs.
Got 'em.
Ooh! Nice place.
Hey, are these<br/>your roommates?
Yes. Uh, yes,<br/>but they are not here.
They are somewhere else.
We have total privacy
because privacy is essential<br/>when you're listening to music.
You know what else is essential<br/>when you're listening to music?
Music.
That's hilarious.
You are hilarious!
I'll go get it<br/>in my bedroom.
The CD's in my bedroom.
Bedroom...
Okay. We'll try and stay out of trouble.
Of course,<br/>we can't promise anything.
This is going to be awesome.
No!
What are you guys doing here?
We know, Ted, well done.
This is very impressive.
Up top.<br/>Yeah, bro, up top.
Oh, don't be gross.
You guys need to<br/>get out of here.
Please, take the fire escape.
No, no way.
The other day I saw<br/>a pigeon take a crap on it
and the whole thing shifted.
Oh, you can use<br/>our bedroom.
Okay, all I need<br/>to seal the deal
is the Wilco CD, Barney.
What are you doing?!
allow Ted to do this.
Wh-what? Why?
Because the belt<br/>is my birthright!
You cannot claim it before I do.
That would be like Jimmy Olsen<br/>capturing Lex Luthor
while Superman watches<br/>impotently from the bedroom.
But, Barney, you've done<br/>way dirtier stuff than Ted.
You're disgusting.
I've never ridden the tricycle.
I was on the verge<br/>last year.
I was so close.
So ladies, why don't<br/>we move this party
to a more horizontal location?
Oh, my God,<br/>my new carpet!
Oh, my God, this<br/>is a disaster.
You get the carpet cleaner.<br/>I'll get a towel.
Okay.<br/>I'll get the video camera.
Get out!<br/>Okay then.
So let me get<br/>this straight.
You're going to trike-block me?
That is so petty.<br/>It's like you're...
Tom Petty.<br/>Tom Petty.
You're Tom Petty.
Where's Lily?
Still looking for that CD,
so...
What are you doing?
I knew it.<br/>I had a hunch about that girl
and I was right.
I saw it first!
You just made the list, bitch.
I cannot give up my bedroom<br/>to a boot thief.
She should be punished,<br/>not rewarded.
Fine, then I'll try to work in a little<br/>light spanking. Just do this for me!
No, never.
What if I reimburse you<br/>for the boots, full retail?
- Please enjoy our bedroom.<br/>- Great.
Just take it.
Okay, wish me luck.
Oh, my God.<br/>It looks fine.
You're such a girl.
Whe's the shaving cream?
Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.
Well, it was implied.
Who buys a razor<br/>without buying shaving cream?
Well, who doesn't shave<br/>their legs for a date?
Well, who's not getting a tip<br/>because of her attitude?
Well, here's a little tip<br/>for you:
shave your legs before you leave<br/>the house, Sasquatch.
Hey, Robin, um, the valet's<br/>brought the car around.
I thought we'd go to my place,
if you're in the mood<br/>for a nightcap.
Absolutely. I just have to go<br/>to the ladies' room.
I've got TB.
Tiny bladder.
I'll meet you out front.
Yeah.
You've got to be kidding me.
Excuse me. Sorry.
So, I'm having a little<br/>trouble finding the CD.
That's okay.
We don't need music to have fun.
Exactly.
You do like to have<br/>fun, don't you, Ted?
It's getting late.<br/>I'll get your coats.
"I'll get your coats"?!
I don't know why I said that.<br/>Why'd I say that?
It's the opposite<br/>of what I meant.
I wanna take clothes off them,<br/>not put more on.
Ted, you're ruining this<br/>for everyone.
Leave him alone!
Sometimes even
the greatest warriors<br/>shoot themselves in the foot.
What are you<br/>talking about?
If you must know, it wasn't<br/>a freak beverage malfunction
that stopped me from riding<br/>the tricycle that night.
So, Barney, why don't we
take this party to a more<br/>horizontal location?
Oh, no, the night's ruined!
No, baby, it's not.
Yes, it! Whatever this night<br/>was heading towards is ruined.
Where's my coat?
Why would you do that<br/>to yourself?
Because you get up<br/>in your head, man.
You start thinking,
"I can't do this.<br/>It's two women."
That's two of everything,<br/>four of some things.
The logistics alone are enough<br/>to cripple even a pro like me.
See, if a complete degenerate<br/>like Barney choked,
what chance do I have?
The best chance in the world.
Fear took the belt from me.
Fear rode the tricycle<br/>that night, my friends.
But fear will not get<br/>a second turn.
- It won't?<br/>- No.
Because I now realize it isn't<br/>my destiny to win the belt.
It is my destiny to help<br/>my friend win it.
Ted is fated<br/>to go there first.
He is our Neil Armstrong.
Spacesuit up, Ted,
'cause you're going<br/>to the moon.
Step one.
Ladies.
I couldn't find your coats,
but I did find... tequila.
Wait, wait, wait,<br/>a remote control fireplace?
We don'Hot have<br/>a remote control fireplace.
Right, that's my apartment.
The dressing gown's mine, too.
Damn, this should be me.
Anyway, continuing...
Whew!
I am so exhausted.
So exhausted.
Wait, why would I want<br/>to tire them out?
That's your excuse<br/>to unleash pretext
for physical contact #1.
Oh, you give<br/>the most amazing foot massage.
That's 'cause I used to practice
all the time on my grandmother.
Why in God's name<br/>would I say that?
It's endearing.<br/>You're a caregiver.
Never take family values<br/>out of the equation.
Step three.
Ted, what's wrong?
I was just thinking about<br/>this documentary I saw once
about something<br/>called a super volcano.
Okay, what the hell?
Wait for it.
It can happen at any time.
And obliterate<br/>all life on Earth,
which is why<br/>I live by three simple words.
Don't postpone joy.
Oh, my God.
That's so true.
Yeah.
The mortality angle.
That's actually pretty good.
- I can do this.<br/>- Yes, you can.
Yeah. I can't believe I'm<br/>going to say this,
but I'm actually moved.
Bring it in, guys.
All right.
I'll see you on the other side.
So what happened next?<br/>Did you do it?
It doesn't seem right<br/>to talk about it.
What? No! Tell me.
Don't tell me<br/>because you don't have to
because you didn't do it.
You didn't do it.<br/>You did it.
You did it, didn't you?
Did you?
You didn't do it.
Yes, you did.<br/>You did.
No, you didn't.
Tell me!
Some stories you tell,<br/>some stories you don't.
That's because you didn't do it.
He didn't do it.
You did it<br/>You did it, didn't you?
You did it.<br/>Tell me, did you?
Ted, belt. Did you?
Did you or didn't you?
Did?
Tell me, please.<br/>For the love...
Do you know<br/>if he did or didn't?
Oh, hey, um,<br/>Hmm?
would you go in there<br/>and see if my date's okay?
No problem.
Thank you.
No, nobody's in there,<br/>but the window's actually open.
I guess I shouldn't be<br/>so surprised.
I mean, she was acting weird<br/>all night, right?
Yeah, you know...
why don't I buy you a drink?
Okay.
Did I overhear<br/>that you're a surgeon?
Guilty as charged.
Oh, you're so funny.
I'm here!
I'm fine!
My head is bleeding.
Going down again.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">It was saturday night<br/>in New York City,
and the young metropolit<br/>was out on the town,
living the kind of crazy lifestyle<br/>you can only find in the Big Apple.
- 97.<br/>- 97.
- 98.<br/>- 98.
- 99.<br/>- 99.
100!
A hundred? We only got to 82<br/>on our honeymoon.
So, Robin?<br/>I've got a guy for you.
- He's cute. He's funny. He's smart.<br/>- What's his "but"?
What do you mean?
When someone wants<br/>to set you up,
they always tell you<br/>their good qualities first, but
then they leave out<br/>their huge flaw.
She's totally hot<br/>and really fun.
But she has a dead tooth.
She's super-hot,<br/>and she's so successful.
But she has a pug that<br/>she pushes around in a stroller
She's so cute,<br/>and she's so smart.
But her last boyfriend had<br/>to get a restraining order against her,
and then his cat and new vacuum<br/>cleaner both went missing.
Wow!<br/>Set it up!
I'm still convinced<br/>she killed my turtle.
Hey, you know what?<br/>Not every setup has a "but."
What about, um, Jamie, that girl<br/>that Lily set you up with?
She was really nice.
If memory serves me,<br/>she had a huge "but."
Her huge butt.
Nailed it!
Well, there's nothing wrong<br/>with this guy.
He's really nice,<br/>and he's really cute...
But?
Fine.
But he has a kid.
Aha! There it is! Robin's not<br/>going out with a guy with a kid.
But the guy is really great,<br/>and his kid's sweet.
- He's in my class.<br/>- It doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.
I don't hate kids.
You told me even when you<br/>were a kid, you hated kids.
Robin, will you watch<br/>cartoons with me?
I go to school all week.
Can't I just have<br/>five minutes to myself
to read Highlights<br/>and drink my juice?
Okay, yes, kids are not my favorite<br/>thing in the world,
- but I like them.<br/>- Well, you don't want to have them.
I like sports cars,
but it doesn't mean I want to<br/>push a Ferrari through my vagina.
Shotgun.
You can't blame us for thinking<br/>that the kid would be a problem.
I mean, if we were friends<br/>with Garfield,
we wouldn't set him up<br/>on a date with Mondays.
You know what? The kid<br/>is not a problem.
I want to meet<br/>this guy.
- Okay. That's awesome!<br/>- Yeah.
Hey, what's my "but"?
You know, I'm a...<br/>I'm really nice, but...
But she's afraid of commitment.
But she's a gun nut.
But she's Canadian.
But she didn't like<br/>Field of Dreams.
- I can't think of...<br/>- You don't have a "but."

Transcript: Raceman<br/>Resync: kabbage
How I met your mother<br/>3x02 - We're Not From Here
Okay.<br/>I've got it.
Here. Put on this eye patch.
- Why?<br/>- The ultimate ice-breaker.
A bunch of cobras got loose<br/>in Central Park.
You and I are jogging...
training for the Death Valley<br/>Iron Man.
No big deal.<br/>We do it every year.
Suddenly,
we see these<br/>snake bastards
sneaking towards a little baby.<br/>Not on our watch.
You grab the kid, I strangle<br/>six cobras with my bare hands.
Women of New York,<br/>one at a time, please.
So what are the eye patches for?
- We got bit.<br/>- On the eye?
Yes.
Both of us?
They're different eyes.<br/>I don't know see why this bumps you!
Patch up!
So Robin went on a date<br/>with George,
the guy with the kid,<br/>and afterwards...
Okay, here's the thing.
George is a great guy.<br/>We had a wonderful date.
But?
Great. I can't<br/>wait to meet him.
"Can't wait to meet him"?
Why did I say that?<br/>I don't want to meet his kid.
Well, you knew<br/>you'd meet him sooner or later.
Oh. I was just hoping<br/>for later, like
in 20 years when I'm a cougar<br/>and he's as hot as his dad.
Robin, what's the big deal?<br/>He's just a kid.
He's not going to bite.
He may bite.<br/>We're working on biting.
Why is this kid around anyway?<br/>Shouldn't he be with his mom?
I mean, what kind of lawyer<br/>does this guy have
if he has to take care<br/>of the kid all the time?
A good one.<br/>He won full custody.
He won?! He won?
Oh, God, getting the kid<br/>is winning, isn't it?
Don't tell anyone I said that.
I'm going out<br/>buying eye patches.
What are you doing<br/>to help score chicks?
Okay, I'm going to let you in<br/>on a little secret.
People with real game<br/>don't need eye patches.
Theodore.<br/>No, no, no.
You can't spell "game"<br/>without "me",
and "me" has the best game.
Yeah, well, I got so much game,<br/>I'm Cornish game hen.
Oh, yeah? I'm the New York State<br/>gaming commissioner.
Well, I'm The Game.<br/>Well-crafted,
keep-you-guessing thriller starring<br/>Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.
You're here<br/>and not in stall two.
Yeah. So?
I may have made some
wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments<br/>to a gentleman wearing your shoes.
- Okay, Marshall?<br/>- Yes.
Which one of us has more game?
Neither of you guys<br/>has any game, right?
Or else you'd be married<br/>like me.
What?
If dating is the game,<br/>then marriage is winning the game.
Yeah. If you're playing<br/>in the women's league.
You're joking.<br/>I have mad game, brah.
One: we agreed not<br/>to ever say "brah" anymore.
It was a good week,<br/>we had a lot of fun, but it's over.
Two: you've been with Lily<br/>for 11 years.
Your idea<br/>of good game is
slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing<br/>two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.
Yeah, I hate to say it, buddy, but, uh,<br/>you're kind of irrelevant.
What? I am not irrelevant.
I know tons of stuff.<br/>I can help you guys.
I don't want to be left out.
Ted, you do not have<br/>more game than me.
By sheer numbers alone, I win.<br/>Come on, dude. You've seen my list.
You guys want to hear one of my lines?
First of all, I did not ask to see<br/>that list, and I am still horrified.
And true game<br/>is about quality, not quantity,
and a quality girl would pick me<br/>over you any day.
Are you a model?
That one's good because<br/>it's flattering. To the girl.
Ted, I challenge you<br/>to a picking up girls Olympiad.
- Fine.<br/>- There will be 26 events
spread out over 11 weeks.
We will travel to a neutral city<br/>where a panel of international judges...
Or we could just choose a girl,<br/>and the first one to seal the deal wins?
That's good, too.
How about her?
You're on.
Before we start, why don't we jot down<br/>a few basic ground rules?
Okay, great. Rule #1:<br/>no eye patches or props of any...
One time, I was with this girl,<br/>and I tried that model line,
and I totally got<br/>some over-the-shirt boob action
in the "Just Say No" assembly.
Man, just stop.<br/>You're bumming everybody out.
Rule number two:<br/>this bet is for one million dollars.
- I win.<br/>- How?
Oh, I slept with her.<br/>About a year ago. I just forgot.
Oh, well, that doesn't count.<br/>The bet started the moment we shook.
But I can't sleep<br/>with her again. She hates me.
Oh. Interesting. Look who just took<br/>a commanding lead.
Now with you out of the picture,<br/>I can take my sweet time.
- Ted, she's leaving.<br/>- Get out of my way.
By the look of those shoes, here<br/>comes your bathroom buddy.
Look who's got game.
So, you're a big<br/>kids person, huh?
Only the biggest ever.
I think kids are<br/>so great,
especially, um, the little ones.
You know, uh... pudgy,<br/>can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.
- You mean babies?<br/>- Yeah, I like that kind.
- Well, Doug's almost six, so...<br/>- Oh, six is great.
Oh, you are going to love six.
Six is when they, uh,<br/>they really start to, um...
I hate kids.
Excuse me. What?
I mean, I don't hate kids.<br/>I'm-I'm just not a kid person.
I mean, yeah, it's cute that<br/>their shoes are real little,
but beyond that,<br/>what's the draw?
You must think I'm nuts.
What? No, no, no. I...<br/>So you don't like kids, so what?
And I'm not looking<br/>for a mother for Doug.
Uh, why don't we just hold off<br/>on you meeting him?
Yeah.<br/>Let's take things slow.
And kids, that's exactly<br/>what she did.
Then, on a totally different day that<br/>was definitely not the next morning,
Aunt Robin had to face<br/>her worst fear.
- Hey, what's up?<br/>- It's here, Lily.
It's looking at me.
The kid. What do I do?
Just talk to him.<br/>You can do this, Robin.
Who are you?
- Um, I'm Robin.<br/>- That's a bird's name.
Ah, no, it's not.<br/>It's actually a type of bird.
My friend Patrick has a parakeet<br/>named Robin, so there.
- Do you want to talk in Morse code?<br/>- Dude, I'm-I'm just reading my paper,
- so...<br/>- Beep.
Beep-beep-beep.
Beep. Beep.<br/>Beep...!
I'm starving.<br/>Will you make me cereal?
Sure.
What are you doing?<br/>You're supposed to pour the milk first.
What?! No, you pour the cereal first so<br/>you know how much milk you need.
It tastes better milk first!
It all tastes the same<br/>once it's in the bowl.
Why are you wearing<br/>my dad's pants?
Milk first it is.
What are you reading?
The business section.
The Fed's going to lower rates again<br/>to bail out these sub-prime lenders.
Bunch of idiots.
Ms. Aldrin says it's not nice<br/>to call people names.
Well, maybe if they weren't such idiot<br/>I wouldn't have to call them that.
That's what I said.
You're pretty cool.
You, too.
Meanwhile, Stacey and I<br/>had started dating.
Oh, Stacey was the girl<br/>from the bar.
Anyway, I was close to winning the bet<br/>when something unexpected happened.
I started<br/>to really like her.
Well, have fun in yoga.
She's strengthening her core.
I think<br/>that's going to be good.
Yeah? All right.
After a while,<br/>crocodile.
You see this?
Game face.
Whatever, Ted.
Oh. Get this. She plays bass<br/>in a reggae band.
They're having a show<br/>this Friday. How cool is that?
Oh, does she know that one song?
Mm-mm, chaka, mm-mm, chaka.
What's that song called?
Oh, right.<br/>It's called every reggae song.
- I am not irrelevant.<br/>- What?
I ran the numbers.
If Lily and I have sex<br/>twice a week,
which let's be honest, we all<br/>know is being conservative,
and we've been together<br/>for ten years,
plus 17 more times<br/>on the honeymoon,
minus the two-week drought when<br/>I said the checker at the grocery store
reminded me of a young Lily,
then we have had sex<br/>a total of...
- wait for it...<br/>- Nice.
1,053-1/2 times.
My mom called once.
But that's more times<br/>than Barney has ever had sex,
and to your point, Ted,<br/>Lily is a quality girl.
I win.<br/>Lawyered.
Doesn't count.
- It totally counts.<br/>- You're right. It does count.
It counts as one.<br/>You've had sex once. How was it?
I still matter.
Okay, Ted, go win the bet.
You have my blessing.<br/>She's a wonderful girl.
I should know.
Oh, okay.<br/>Ok, I see what you're doing.
We've never shared a woman,<br/>have we, Ted? Isn't that funny?
You're with her now.<br/>I was with her a year ago.
You figure, for her,<br/>that's like 200 showers ago.
You've got to ask yourself, Ted,<br/>"Is 200 enough?"
You know what?
I don't mind.
No, of course you don't mind.
Just like the second guy to climb<br/>Mount Everest didn't mind
getting all the way to the top only<br/>to find Sir Edmund Hillary's flagpole
thrust into its supple peak.
No, I'm sure when you're with her,<br/>I'll be the furthest thing from your mind.
Kissing what I've already kissed,
nuzzling what I've already nuzzled,
going... (blubbering) on what<br/>I've already gone (blubbering) on.
Barney, I'm not afraid<br/>of catching your cooties, 'kay?
Really?<br/>Ted's not afraid of cooties?
Okay, well, then I guess<br/>you'd have no problem
- having a sip of my gin and tonic.<br/>- Fine.
And I only stirred that<br/>with my pinky.
Guess who loves Robin.
Kids. Kids love Robin.
Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.
Really, that's great!<br/>You and George, all thanks to me.
Yeah, I'm going to have<br/>to break up with him.
- What?<br/>- Well, it's just...
it's getting a little bit<br/>too serious with the kid.
You know, it's just not<br/>what I'm looking for.
So better I break it off now<br/>before he gets too attached.
What?
I hate to tell you, but...
too late.
He drew it in class today.
Oh, crap.
There's no way<br/>that's a picture of me.
That woman has on hoop earrings.<br/>I don't even own hoop earrings.
I have one pair and they're gold.<br/>Those are fruit loops.
You are so in denial right now
and you're doing what you always<br/>do in relationships:
the second you get close<br/>to a guy, you want to bail.
Okay, granted, he's six,<br/>but the point stands.
Well, we'll ask the guys.
They'll tell you that's not me.
That's totally you.
Wh... you guys are crazy.
Hey, who drew<br/>the picture of Robin?
- It's not me.<br/>- You're joking, right?
- It's not me!<br/>- "My new mommy."
Kind of has<br/>a nice ring to it.
Hey, now that you're a mom,<br/>are you going to start wearing
those totally awesome jeans<br/>that go right up to your boobs?
Do you guys really<br/>think this is me?
Honey, it's you.
And if you're going<br/>to break up with George,
you have to break up<br/>with his kid, too.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah, you can't just abandon him.
You have to talk to him.
Come on, Robin, you know<br/>it's the right thing to do.
Oh, man.
Doug was right:<br/>You are a pain in the ass.
So I had a really<br/>nice time tonight.
- Me, too.<br/>- Yeah?
Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want,<br/>but I was here first.
From this spot, I also launched<br/>an expedition
to those two large ridges<br/>down there.
Ted?
Something wrong?
- Hey, Doug.<br/>- Are you here to see my dad?
He's taking a shower.
Actually, I came to see you.
I wrote a poem.<br/>Do you want to hear it?
Sure. Why not?
"To my new mommy.
"You are pretty.
"You are nice.
- And you smell like daisies."<br/>- Aw, that is so sweet.
Even though it<br/>doesn't rhyme.
Look, uh, Doug.
There's no good way<br/>to say this, uh...
Aunt Robin didn't know<br/>what to say.
This kid has never been<br/>dumped before.
But then she realized...
this kid had never<br/>been dumped before.
She could use every clich?<br/>in the book.
We need to talk.
I just think, um, we both could use<br/>some space right now.
It's not you. It's me.
Look, I know this hurts,<br/>but you deserve someone better.
I'm just really trying to focus<br/>on my career right now.
You know?
I just hope we can<br/>still be friends.
Hi.
I'm Brooke. I'm here<br/>for my date with George.
You must be<br/>the babysitter.
I had so much coffee earlier. I need<br/>to run to the loo, but hey, Dougie.
What the hell was that?
That was my new mom.
So...<br/>this picture is not of me?
- Why would I draw a picture of you?<br/>- Wha...?
How many dates has she been on<br/>with your dad?
Two.
I've been on, like, five<br/>and you like her better?
We just really connected.
And what about me?
You think I just go around pouring<br/>cereal for every boy in town?
Why are you getting<br/>so upset, Roberta?
Robin. My name is Robin.
Like the bird, remember?
Whatever.
So that's it, huh?
- Look, you're great, but...<br/>- Yeah.
There's always a "but."
Well, I couldn't do it.<br/>I broke up with her.
Thanks a lot, by the way.<br/>A beautiful, sexy girl
and all I could think about<br/>was you being there first.
You were stuck in my head<br/>like a Chumbawamba song.
Which Chumbawamba song?
Well, what an interesting<br/>turn of events.
It looks like I'm going to win.
What do you mean "win"?<br/>You couldn't even talk to her.
You tried<br/>and you got slapped.
That's what you think happened.
Okay, great, rule #1:<br/>no eye patches or props of any ki...
Here's the deal: my friend just got<br/>dumped, so he's a little shy,
but he'd love to buy you<br/>a drink and get to know you.
The problem is, he thinks a pretty girl<br/>like you won't go for a guy like him.
So would you slap me across the face so he can<br/>see you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?
What do you say? For my friend?
You are so sweet.
So now, whatever nice things<br/>Ted does for her, in her mind,
I'm the guy who's even<br/>nicer than him.
So you never<br/>slept with her?
Not even at all.
Wow, that's good.
It gets better.
Remember Ted's phone<br/>conversation?
Well, have fun in yoga.
Well...
- I am...<br/>- Sorry.
Stacey, right?
Yeah... oh, you're Ted's<br/>friend from the bar, right?
Wait, don't tell me<br/>you go to yoga here, too.
I do.
She plays bass in a reggae band.
...and then I'm going to head<br/>out to a reggae concert.
I'm a huge fan of reggae.
Oh, my gosh!
I play in a reggae band.
No way.
I wonder why Ted didn't<br/>tell me about that.
Like I said,<br/>I'm a huge reggae fan.
Well... I should go inside.
After a while, crocodile.
- See you later, allig...<br/>- See you later, allig...
We are two peas.
Wow, well, take care.
Um, namaste.
You are a sociopath.
And that was my yoga mat.
So now with Ted out of the picture,<br/>I'm going to swoop in
and win the whole thing.
Why?
Parce que j'ai le jeu,<br/>mes chiennes.
Translation:
"'Cause I got game, bitches."
No. No, this doesn't<br/>prove anything because...
Hold on a second.
It's Stacey.
Hey, Stace?
What happened?
He did not!
Stay there.<br/>I'll be right over.
I should've just worn<br/>that stupid eye patch.
Oh, I can't believe you got<br/>dumped by a six-year-old.
Whatever.<br/>He's a stupid-head.
I'm just...<br/>I'm done with kids.
Of course, Robin eventually<br/>made her peace with kids.
And as you guys know,
she went on to appear in some<br/>very important works of art:
yours.
Hey.
You know, I really appreciate
how cool you've been<br/>about us taking things slow.
Since Ted, you know, I...
I don't really want<br/>to get physical too fast.
That's what makes you<br/>so special, baby.
Anyway, I am so psyched<br/>to be playing Sunsplash tomorrow.
We go on sometime<br/>between 11:00 and 6:00,
so you probably want to get there<br/>before 9:00 just to be safe.
Oh...<br/>and it's gonna be muddy.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Oh, God, what was her name?
it's been 23 years,
I can't remember<br/>all this stuff.
For the sake of the story,<br/>let's call her...
Everyone, this is Blahblah.
Please, call me Blah.
So, Blah, how did<br/>you two meet?
Well, I was taking<br/>this cooking class,
French Fusion, and everyone<br/>already had a partner,
but then I looked up<br/>and across a crowded room,
I saw Ted.
It was magical.
It was so magical.
Except it wasn't.
She's going to tell some bogus<br/>story about a cooking class
because she's embarrassed<br/>we met online.
- Ai Chihuahua!<br/>- What?
What? There's no stigma anymore.
Oh, there's a stigma.
That's why people always say,<br/>"There's no stigma anymore."
So, she's hot?
Oh, she's gorgeous.
Then she's crazy.
No, she's not.
Ted, the only hot girls<br/>that troll the Internet
for dudes are crazy,<br/>hookers, or dudes.
Okay, she's<br/>not crazy.
She's not a hooker.<br/>She's not a dude.
There's this guy I pass on<br/>my way to work every day
who's all three... scares<br/>the crap out of me.
There is no way<br/>she is above the line
on the Hot/Crazy scale.
She's not even on<br/>the Hot/Crazy scale.
She's just hot.
Wait."Hot/Crazy scale"?
Let me illustrate.
A girl is allowed to be crazy
as long as she is equally hot.
Thus, if she's this crazy,<br/>she has to be this hot.
If she's this crazy,<br/>she has to be this hot.
You want a girl<br/>to be above this line,
also known<br/>as the Vickie Mendoza Diagonal.
This girl I dated, she played<br/>jump rope with that line.
She'd shave her head,<br/>then lose ten pounds.
She'd stab me with a fork,<br/>then get a boob job.
I should give her a call.
Okay, so please,
just play along<br/>with her fake story.
We met in a cooking class.
I don't know, Ted.
I don't know if I can<br/>just play along
with your crazy girlfriend's<br/>fake story.
Now, if you had said<br/>fake breasts...
She's not crazy.
Okay. We'll see.
Long story short, thank goodness<br/>I'm such a bad cook,
or I never would have met Ted.
Oh, crazy<br/>how cute that is.
It's crazy.
You know who else has a really<br/>cute story of how they met?
Marshal and Lily.
You guys should tell<br/>that story, right now.
Yeah.
All right.<br/>But spoiler alert.
It ends with everyone<br/>saying, "Aw!"
Aw.
Starts with it, too.
When you've been a couple<br/>as long as Marshal and Lily,
telling the how-we-met story<br/>becomes a choreographed dance.
It was late August, 1996.
Lily and I were both<br/>freshman moving into...
- Hewitt Hall.<br/>- Hewitt Hall.
And she needed some help<br/>setting up her stereo.
For some unknown reason,<br/>I felt drawn to room 110.
As if she knew
that someone very special<br/>was behind that door.
And as fate would have it<br/>that someone was Marshall.
- It was love at first sight.<br/>- It was love at first sight.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
Aw...
I know, right?
Now, they perfected that story<br/>over hundreds of tellings.
The first time<br/>Marshall told it to me,
it was a little different.
Dude, this black-haired<br/>Goth chick stopped by today.
Want to tap it.
You guys are so lucky.
You know, when Ted and I<br/>were cooking
and our hands touched<br/>for the first time,
I knew right then<br/>that after class
he would take me up on the roof,<br/>kiss me and give me a rose.
Which he did!
Say, "Aw."
- Aw.<br/>- Aw.
I know, right?
I'll get the next round,<br/>okay, guys?
Anybody would be stressed out<br/>meeting new people.
She's not crazy.
Crazy-generous maybe,<br/>buying us drinks.
Shut up.
So we know how<br/>Marshall and Lily met
Robin, how did<br/>you and Barney meet?
No...
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.<br/>No, no, no.
No. No. Barney and I<br/>are not together. No. No.
Really? 16 no's?<br/>Really?
So you're...
single?
Yeah.
Oh. So, pretty and single<br/>and friends with Ted.
Great.
You know who else is<br/>friends with Ted?
Marshall.
How did we meet?
It was a good story.
I'm going to tell it,<br/>right now.
Uh, it was the first<br/>day of college.
Kids, to understand this story,<br/>you need to know
that your Uncle Marshall<br/>was doing something
that lots of college kids do.
How do I say this?
He was, uh...<br/>let's say, eating a sandwich.
Dude, I heard<br/>the dean is coming.
Put out your sandwich.
Hey.
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Marshall Erickson.
"Sir"? No, please,<br/>just call me Ted.
Okay, Dean Ted.
Whoa...
Someone's been eating<br/>a sandwich.
What? No. Really?
I don't know 'cause I don't even<br/>know what sandwiches smell like.
My parents are going to donate<br/>a lot of money to this school.
So you're bottom bunk;<br/>that's cool.
I wanted the<br/>top bunk anyway.
What do you mean?
I'm you're new roommate.
So unfair.
I didn't realize<br/>Ted wasn't the dean
until later that night.
You're not the dean.
College... good times.
Oh, I get it. Ted told you<br/>I didn't go to college,
so now you're giving me<br/>a cute, little backhanded slap.
Oh, here we go.
Well, while you were busy majoring<br/>in being freakin' beautiful,
I was starting<br/>my own line of handbags.
Your own line<br/>of handbags?
That's crazy.
These have sold in Japan.
Robin, have you ever sold<br/>anything in Japan?
Uh, no. But I would love<br/>to buy one of them, if...
Where can I get one?
I don't have a distributor<br/>here yet,
but than for rubbing that in.
Why are you trying<br/>to undermine me in front of Ted?
Look, there's nothing going on<br/>between me and Ted.
Wow, that just...<br/>came out of nowhere.
No, I'm just saying that you<br/>have nothing to worry about.
I wasn't worried.<br/>Are you saying I should be?
No, I'm saying<br/>that you shouldn't be.
Oh, good, 'cause I'm not.
Now, Robin,<br/>can you just let it go?
You're making all of us<br/>really uncomfortable.
You know what else is<br/>a good story?
How Barney and I met.
Barney, tell that story,<br/>right now, please.
Okay, Ted.<br/>This is a crazy story.
You're going to love it.
Tonight's<br/>the first time
I'm taking my deaf brother out<br/>since our mom died.
Oh, I'm sorry<br/>about that.
No, that's okay.
I have to take care<br/>of him now.
Of course, I have had<br/>to put my dreams on hold
in order to do it,<br/>but...
I'm happy to.
He's my brother<br/>and I love him.
I'm sorry,<br/>it's all still so fresh.
Well, man, I'm, uh...<br/>I'm really sorry.
Wow, you bought that?
What?
I just made that up<br/>in mid-pee.
If it worked on you,<br/>it's definitely going to work
on the blonde chick<br/>at the end of the bar.
Unless you're a total idiot.<br/>What's your name?
Ted.
Are you a total idiot, Ted?
Well, I'm still having<br/>this conversation, so...
Well played.
I like you, Ted.
Ted, I'm going to teach<br/>you how to live.
Barney.<br/>We met at the urinal.
Oh, right. Hi.
Lesson one: Lose the goatee;<br/>it doesn't go with your suit.
I'm not wearing a suit.
Lesson two: Get a suit.
Suits are cool...<br/>Exhibit A.
Lesson three: Don't even think<br/>about getting married until you're 30.
And lesson four:
Be totally silent for<br/>the next five minutes.
Hey, Audrey.
Uh, this is<br/>my deaf brother, Edward.
Edward!
This is Audrey!
You know, I actually know<br/>some sign language.
He doesn't sign.
He's embarrassed by his hands.
They're tiny...<br/>and lady-like.
What? You...<br/>are over your hand issues.
It's about time.
Here. Call me.
And even though that girl ended<br/>up giving me a fake number,
I knew that Ted and I would be<br/>each others wingmen forever.
Barney, it's<br/>time you knew.
Um, that story actually goes<br/>a little bit differently.
Great. Funny.
God, with a wingman like Ted,<br/>I might need to resort
to meeting someone in a super,<br/>desperate and lame way,
like online.
Online.
Online.
Oh, my God!<br/>You told them?!
Okay, yes, I told them.
But it's not a big deal.
Lots of people meet<br/>on the Internet.
That whole scene, a stranger<br/>across a crowded room thing...
that only happens<br/>in the movies.
Yeah, that never happens.<br/>Oh, wait, except you and Robin.
That's how<br/>you guys met, right?
Wait, you guys dated?
For how long?
A year.
But don't worry.
The relationship<br/>wasn't that good.
By the end, it was<br/>mostly about sex.
Which was not that good.
But I was the problem.<br/>I'd just lie there.
Ted is, uh,<br/>very good.
I'm sure he will get you<br/>where you need to go.
Can I buy your bags online?
Oh, oh, I see what's<br/>going on here, Ted.
I'm just some random girl<br/>to make Robin jealous,
and after she takes<br/>you back,
you probably won't<br/>even remember my name.
Come on, Blahblah,<br/>it's not like that.
Well, we're closing in<br/>on the half.
Let's see how Blahblah is doing<br/>on the crazy/hot scale.
She started the night here,<br/>but as the night's progressed,
she's gotten crazier<br/>but no hotter,
which has caused her to drift<br/>across the Mendoza Diagonal
and dangerously close<br/>to the Shelly Gilespie Zone.
Another girl I dated...
she gained 20 pounds and tried<br/>to kill me with a brick.
I'm sorry I didn't tell<br/>you, but seriously,
there's nothing going<br/>on with me and Robin.
Then why has she been trying<br/>to undermine me all night?
I mean, look at her.
She's laughing at me<br/>right now.
I'm sorry,<br/>it's just, you know,
Lily and Marshall's story<br/>is so romantic.
I just wish we had<br/>something like that.
Well, their story's not<br/>as magical as it seems.
What do you mean?
No, I, I can't, it's,<br/>it's kind of a secret.
Well, how about I tell you<br/>a little secret
about what you might get<br/>to do later tonight?
The night before<br/>Lily met Marshall...
...there was this party.
Hey.
You a freshwoman?
I never use<br/>the word "freshman."
Sexist.
Yeah, I'm a first year.
I'm in Hewitt 220.
No way. Hewitt 110.
You should totally come by.
Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.
Look at these drunk idiots.
Hey, don't drink<br/>their two dollar beer.
This is a pinot noir.<br/>From Europe.
Oh, it's fruity.
Yeah, I cut it<br/>with some cranberry juice.
It was pretty strong.
So, uh...
do you have a girlfriend?
Yeah.
Not sure about the whole<br/>"long distance" thing, though.
It's like Descartes says.
"In order to determine
"whether there is anything<br/>we can know with certainty,
we first have to doubt<br/>everything we know."
You know?
Wow.
But as drunk as she was, when<br/>she woke up the next morning,
she still<br/>remembered room 110.
That's why she<br/>knocked on the door.
She was looking for me.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, and in<br/>all these years,
Lily and I have never<br/>even spoken about it,
so again, mum's the word, okay?
You have to tell Marshall.
No, if, if he heard that,<br/>it would destroy him.
If you don't tell him...
...I will.
Oh, come on, you wouldn't.
So, Lily,<br/>how did you and Ted meet?
Come on, Lily, the real story.
I don't think anyone wants<br/>to hear that story.
Aw, don't be embarrassed, Ted,<br/>it was a long time ago.
And I made a huge mistuge<br/>last night,
but it's like<br/>Descartes says.
"In order to determine<br/>whether there is anything
"we can know with certainty,
we first have<br/>to doubt everything we know."
And I now know for certain<br/>that I love you, Karen.
Anyway, call me back<br/>when you get this.
I'm also going down<br/>to the computer center
to send you an electronic mail.
Ted.
This is Lily.
No, no, I'm sorry,<br/>but I love Karen.
Yes, that is the unabridged<br/>story of how Lily and I met.
How embarrassing.
Who wants another round?
That's not the story.<br/>Ted, tell 'em.
Tell us what?
Um, Lily, will you help us get<br/>the next round?
Ted, what's going on?
She knows about us,<br/>about how we really met.
Yeah, I know,<br/>I just told her.
No, the<br/>real story.
Ted, what are you<br/>talking about?
Lily... come on.
Come on, what?
Lily... come on.
Ted, I honestly don't know<br/>what you're talking about.
Lily... come on.
I know that you and Ted made out<br/>the night before you met Marshall.
What?
Ted and I never made out.
Yeah... we did.
I only made out<br/>with one other guy in college
before I met Marshall, and<br/>it was just some random dude.
I, I don't even<br/>remember his name.
I just call him<br/>Too Much Tongue Guy.
What? Too Much Tongue Guy?
Well, I'm not<br/>surprised to hear that
coming from Unreasonably<br/>Small Mouth Opening Girl.
That wasn't me.
Yes, it was, at the<br/>freshman orientation party.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
How much fun is this?
All of us reminiscing<br/>about how we met me?
Robin, have I told you<br/>how I met Marshall?
Uh, yeah,<br/>like five or six ti...
It was right<br/>over there.
Here's your problem.
You've only slept<br/>with one woman.
Those kind of stats<br/>are only okay if you're 11,
but tonight<br/>we're getting you a new girl
because,<br/>Marshall Eriksen,
from this moment on, I make<br/>all your decisions for you.
I'm sorry,<br/>who, who are you again?
This is Barney; I met<br/>him the other day.
He's kind of<br/>a jackass.
I'm teaching Ted how to live,
and... lucky you... I have room<br/>for one more student.
Think of me as Yoda,
only instead of being little and green,
I wear suits and I'm awesome.
I'm your bro.
I'm Bro-da.
And tonight,<br/>you're going to use The Force
to get the hottest chick<br/>in this bar into bed.
He's going to<br/>use force?
'Cause that sounds<br/>wrong, Bro-da.
No, The Force.
It's a Star Wars reference.
So we should make lots of Star<br/>Wars references around girls.
That's what<br/>you're saying?
I'm not going to cheat<br/>on my girlfriend.
Yes, you are, with the hottie<br/>that just walked in.
Look at her.
How much hotter<br/>is she than your girlfriend?
There's no comparison.
What do you think, Ted?
- No.<br/>- Should I go for it?
Don't do it, man.
I mean, think about Lily.
You know what?<br/>I don't care.
I've been with one woman<br/>for too long.
I need me some strange.
Yes! Yes!
Pep talk.
You can do this,
but to be more accurate,<br/>you probably can't.
You're way out of practice and<br/>she is way too hot for you,
so remember, tonight<br/>isn't about scoring.
It's about believing<br/>that you can do it
even though<br/>you probably can't.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Poor guy's going<br/>to crash and burn.
That man is a god.
For like a week after,
Barney followed me around<br/>asking me to teach him how to live.
I even got him<br/>to do my laundry once.
I thought it was a Mr.<br/>Miyagi kind of thing.
Marshall, I need to talk to you.
Can we go somewhere in private?
Yeah, of course. What's wrong?
Lily and Ted made out.
What do you think of that,<br/>Robin?
What are you talking about?
You know that guy<br/>I made out with
at the freshman<br/>orientation party?
Too Much Tongue Guy, yeah.
And you know that girl<br/>I made out with
at the freshman<br/>orientation party?
Unreasonably Small<br/>Mouth Opening Girl, yeah.
I'm Too Much Tongue Guy.
And I'm Unreasonably<br/>Small Mouth Opening Girl.
Worst superheroes ever.
Oh, baby, I am so sorry.
I don't think<br/>you need to be.
I was at that party.
It was dark and, granted,
I had eaten quite a few<br/>sandwiches, but I'm 100% sure
that Unreasonably Small<br/>Mouth Opening Girl
was Alexa<br/>Leskeys, not Lily.
Really?
Yeah, I'm positive,
and Too Much Tongue<br/>Guy was Colin O'Reilly.
Are you sure?
If it wasn't,
I peed in the wrong<br/>guy's shampoo, man.
You don't really<br/>believe that, do you?
You swore it was Lily.
I guess I made a mistake.
Must have been Alexa
Another girl, Ted?
Who haven't you made out with?
You know what?<br/>I don't need this.
I design handbags,<br/>I'm writing a memoir,
I'm a superstar,<br/>this is totally my year.
Someday the name Blahblah<br/>will be up in lights.
And, Ted, next time you're online<br/>playing World of Warcraft,
don't even think<br/>about chatting with me.
World of Warcraft?
The online role-playing game?
That's how you two "met online"?
Yeah, it's a really...<br/>it's a cool game.
So suffice it to say,
Blahblah did not turn out<br/>to be your mother,
and as for the girl<br/>I made out with at the party,
there wasn't a doubt in my mind<br/>that was your Aunt Lily.
But, you know,<br/>that magical story
of how she<br/>and Uncle Marshall met,
it was worth preserving,<br/>so I kept my mouth shut.
I guess I made a mistake.
Must have been Alexa.
Until our 20th college reunion
when I ran into Alexa Leskeys.
So, Ted, remember<br/>the last time we were here?
You and me?
No idea.
Ted... come on.
Freshman year,<br/>we were both pretty drunk?
That was you?
Lily, we never made out.
I know.
So I am not Too<br/>Much Tongue Guy.
Actually...
No.
Look what I've confiscated<br/>from some kids.
That is a fat sandwich.
I know, right?
Chew, chew, chew,<br/>chew, swallow.
Oh, that's all right,<br/>honey.
Sandwiches are strong<br/>these days.
I can't believe I used<br/>to be able to eat
a whole sandwich<br/>by myself.
Now it's like two<br/>bites and I am done.
Baby, can we grow sandwiches<br/>behind the garage?
Dude, we're 42.
W-W-Where's my wife?

[<div class="full-script">It was quiet in November afternoon in 2007.
I was working from home,
because, you know, no distractions.
- This is incredible!<br/>- Oh, my God!
I can't believe it!
- I have big news.<br/>- Oh, my God!
Okay, my thing's<br/>pretty huge.
- But fine, you can go first.<br/>- Okay,
- I just...<br/>- I found a porno starring Ted Mosby!
What are you...,<br/>what are talking about?
I'm talking about Welcome<br/>to the Sex Plane,
and look who plays<br/>the navigator,
Ted Mosby.
Whoa.
It's the same exact spelling<br/>as my name.
Okay, you know,
cute coincidence, Barney.<br/>Whatever.
I just got off the phone<br/>with the NR...
Oh, my God,<br/>this totally explains the thing
at my doctor's the other day.
Open wide.
I guess you're more used<br/>to say that
than hearing it,<br/>huh, Ted Mosby?
Who is this guy?
And why's my doctor<br/>watching porn?
All right, let's meet<br/>your new doppelganger.
Or should I say doppelbanger?
Oh.
Guys, guys, guys!
Can I tell my news?
- It's pretty...<br/>- This is really bizarre.
The only other famous Mosby I know<br/>was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
Probably not the same guy.
I got the job<br/>at the NRDC!
You got the job!<br/>Oh! ah
The NRDC, a nature resources defense counsel
fought to preserve America's clean water,
fresh air and<br/>pristine wilderness.
It was Marshall's dream job.
- Congrats, buddy!<br/>- Thanks.
It's kind of weird hugging<br/>with porn on.
Yeah, it really is.
- Oh!<br/>- Hey, hey-o!
New guy entering the cockpit.
Could it be the navigator,<br/>Ted Mosby?
Uh... no.
Navigators have three<br/>stripes on their hats.
Captains have four.<br/>The guy's a captain.
Yeah I'm sure<br/>complete accuracy
in all those details was very<br/>important to the directors...
"Dirt and Skank,<br/>The Raunch Brothers."
Baby, I have some<br/>exciting news!
I hope it's not that you just<br/>won some sort of race here.
I got the job<br/>at the NRDC!
And I found a porno<br/>starring Ted Mosby!
Oh my God,<br/>that's amazing!
I know, right?
Oh, congratulations,<br/>Marshall!
Congratulations to us all!
Oh, let's go<br/>celebrate!
The fact that I found a porno<br/>starring a guy named Ted Mosby...
let's do it!
Oh, is that him?
'Cause that Ted Mosby<br/>really knows what he's doing.
No, that's not him.
What do you mean,
"that" Ted Mosby really knows<br/>what he's doing.
Oh, no.
No, I meant, that<br/>Ted Mosby,
he really knows<br/>what he's doing.
Like all Ted Mosbys.
Wow, NRDC!
Way to go, Marshall.
But you're still gonna go to your job<br/>interview today, right, baby?
Marshall had an interview<br/>at a firm called Nicholson, Hewitt and West.
They represented well<br/>pretty much everybody
Marshall was going to<br/>sue once he started at the NRDC.
I'm not doing that interview.<br/>Those people are evil.
Marshall, your dad went through<br/>a lot of trouble to set this up.
You can't just pull out<br/>at the last second.
Apparently you can.
Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat!<br/>Three stripes!
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you<br/>Ted Mosby, porn star.
- Oh. Wow.<br/>- whoa!
I know what kind<br/>of plane this is.
It's a "Boing."
See.
This is way better<br/>than Marshall's internship.
It's a real job.
Who is this guy?
Are we related?
Do, do I look like him?
Um...
It's hard to tell.
Go, go like this.
Oh, yeah, a little bit.<br/>Yeah.
More around the eyes.<br/>Oh, I do see that.
And here's your water,<br/>in case you're dehydrated,
Ted Mosby.
Very funny, Wendy.
Now we know<br/>you watch porn.
This Ted Mosby must<br/>be getting kind of famous.
Mm.<br/>You're not wrong.
According to<br/>the Web site,
of the far superior<br/>Ted Mosby...
..been in the business<br/>three months,
and he's made<br/>125 movies.
Wow.
That's 42 movies<br/>a month.
Who is he, Jude Law?
Right?
He makes a lot<br/>of movies.
I mean,
not so much lately,
but maybe, like,<br/>two years ago,
you couldn't go to a movie without...<br/>Shh...
Oh, hey, look,<br/>check it out.
Ted Mosby did an interview<br/>in Adult Video Weekly.
Adult Video Weekly?
Oh, no.
[Phone Rings]
Hello?
Hi, I'm looking for Ted Mosby.
It's Leonard Ross from AVW.
Oh, my God!
AVW?
It's Architecture Vision Weekly!
Um...
Wow, I've been reading<br/>your magazine
since I was a little kid.
Well, that's a bummer.
Anyway, I'm calling to interview<br/>you about your latest project.
Well, I don't want to say<br/>it's my project.
I mean, I'll be working<br/>with at least three partners.
Oh! Group scene.<br/>Always fun.
Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking<br/>forward to it.
I mean, I know they're gonna<br/>ride me pretty hard
but they're great guys.
Guys?
Whoa, there's a scoop.
That interview went on<br/>for 20 more minutes.
"This project was so demanding,
"I can't tell you how many nights
I spent bent over a table."
[Laughter]
Oh, hey, baby,<br/>how'd the interview go?
Um, interesting.
There I am in the office<br/>of Jefferson Coatsworth,
and I figure I'm not gonna<br/>take this job anyway,
I might as well give this old<br/>bastard a piece of my mind.
Jefferson Coatsworth
wasn't what I expected.
Marshall,
Jeff Coatsworth.
Hello.
Dude, I am so, so psyched<br/>that you're here.
Can I beer ya?
Marshall was thrown.
This guy seemed nice.
Of course, he wasn't.
[Reporters Clamoring]
Go-go to hell!
I'd do it again!
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.
Marshall,
why do you want to work
at Nicholson, Hewitt &amp; West?
Right, um,<br/>okay, Jeff,
I've actually given<br/>this a lot of thought...
I'm sorry. Stop.
I can't do this<br/>with a straight face.
You don't want<br/>to work here.
You're only here 'cause your dad<br/>went to high school with Joe Hewitt.
Fact is, you just got a sweet job<br/>at the NRDC.
And it's awesome.
Man, I could have gone<br/>the non-profit route.
I didn't.
And it eats me up inside<br/>every day.
I hate myself.
I hate myself.
Oh, he's good.
Classic seduction technique.
What do you mean?
Oh, I use it all the time.
First I buy her...<br/>and by her I mean you... a drink.
Now, I'm the guy who<br/>gets her what she wants.
Then I pretend to care
about whatever idiotic thing<br/>she cares about.
For you, that would be<br/>the environment.
Now, I'm the great<br/>guy who shares her interests.
And before you know it,<br/>you're naked in my apartment shouting,
"Oh, oh,<br/>Bar-r-r-ne-e-ey!"
And by you,<br/>I mean her.
He is not trying<br/>to seduce me.
He didn't even<br/>offer me the job.
That comes later.
At dinner.
He did invite you to dinner,<br/>didn't he?
Let me buy you dinner
tomorrow night
as a thank you, okay?
You'll tell me all<br/>about the NRDC,
and we'll charge it all to<br/>one of my evil clients.
- I, you know, I don't know,<br/>- Marshall,
I don't know if...
you know what<br/>Kobe beef is?
The most expensive beef<br/>in the world.
The place I'm taking<br/>you has Kobe lobster.
That is lobster fed<br/>with Kobe beef.
Oh, my God, he's<br/>trying to seduce me.
So are you gonna go<br/>to dinner with him?
No. No way.
I promised myself<br/>to the NRDC.
I'm not that kind<br/>of lawyer.
Oh, you should go.
I mean, you're not<br/>gonna take the job,
but you might as well<br/>get a great meal out of the deal.
Don't wait up.
Guys, guys, guys,<br/>check this out.
Ted Mosby porn star's<br/>says bio his hometown is your hometown.
Shaker Heights, Ohio.
What?
Okay, this is<br/>getting creepy.
Who, who is this guy?
I gotta find him.
Well, it's your<br/>lucky day.
He's gonna be signing autographs<br/>tomorrow night in Manhattan
at something called<br/>the Adult Video Expo.
- Mm.<br/>- Wait.
Are you telling me that
they actually have<br/>conventions for porn?
Affirmative.
Or to put it another way...
God bless America.
You can really taste the beef<br/>in that lobster.
Right.
Listen,
I know we're only here<br/>to screw over my client,
who quite frankly deserves it...
but I gotta be able<br/>to tell the guys upstairs
I gave you the spiel, okay?
So, first up,
starting salary.
Okay.
Here we go.
This is the big number that's<br/>supposed to impress me and...
Wow.
That is a big number.
There's also a signing bonus,
uh, use of a company car,
expense account,<br/>blah blah blah.
Hey, by the way, turn around<br/>and wave to Patrick Swayze.
Hey.
I'm going to, uh,<br/>try to remain cool.
But you know Patrick Swayze?!
He's a client.
Who do you think bought us<br/>this wine.
Crazy Swayze.
Cheers, buddy.
Okay. No.
Jeff, this is all<br/>very impressive,
- but I just don't think that...<br/>- Listen, I know, I know.
gonna be tempted by big numbers<br/>and fancy perks.
Yore gonna do the noble thing,
take the low-paying job<br/>at the NRDC,
live off your family money.
Family money?
You do have family money,<br/>don't you?
No, um, not that I know of.
I do have an uncle who owns a,<br/>a pretty successful bait shop.
NRDC.
No family money.
Oh.<br/>You don't have plan on aving kids.
Actually, I,<br/>I want to have four kids.
Well...
New York public schools make<br/>a lot of parents nervous,
but the kids who walk out,<br/>walk out proud.
It was turning into a tough decision.
Now, kids, when I'm faced<br/>with a tough decision
I like to get out the old yellow pad make a list<br/>of pros and cons.
Marshall knew all the cons,<br/>but there was one thing he didn't know.
a big guy live in a pros con
Lily,<br/>you're a kindergarten teacher.
Yeah.
'Cause Robin was about to ask Lily<br/>the one question...
An-And you make a kindergarten<br/>teacher's salary, right?
Yeah.
...that Lily had been dreading<br/>for years.
Well, how do you afford all<br/>of these expensive clothes?
I shop the sales.
They were in the closet<br/>when we moved in.
I steal.
I'm a criminal.
I once shot a man<br/>just to watch him die.
Lily?
Okay.
That's when Lily showed Robin<br/>her box of shame.
Lily, this is nuts.
How many credit<br/>cards do you have?
I don't know.
Well, how much do you owe?
I don't know!
Wow.
I can't believe this many<br/>people love porn this much,
including that guy who works<br/>in human resources at my firm.
Hi.
Let's just wave at<br/>each other awkwardly.
That'll make<br/>it better.
Dude, come on, let's just find<br/>bizarro me and get out of here.
Oh, oh, I get it.
Ted Mosby, non-porn star,<br/>thinks this is all crude and disgusting.
You know who else was considered<br/>crude and disgusting?
Shakespeare.
Hmm.<br/>But his themes...
love, lust, forbidden<br/>desire... were universal
which is why his work has<br/>stood the test of time.
And so will<br/>all this.
400 years from now, some<br/>high school drama class
will be doing a plucky,<br/>spirited production
of Beef Party VII.
Oh, my God, Lily,<br/>that is a lot of debt.
How did you get yourself<br/>into this situation?
I don't know what it is.
When I feel down<br/>about something, I shop.
Ma'am, is everything okay?
Oh, I just had a huge fight<br/>with my mother.
She doesn't understand me<br/>at all.
I swore that teaching would be<br/>a way to support my painting career,
but I never paint anymore.
I just got<br/>a huge credit card bill.
Does Marshall know?
No.
But you guys are the couple<br/>who tell each other everything.
And for God's sakes, Lily,<br/>you text him while he's on the can.
Well, I just want him<br/>to know I'm rooting for him.
Wait, okay, this<br/>all makes sense.
So when you said...
But you're still going to go<br/>to your job interview today, right, baby?
And then...
Oh, you should go.
I mean, you not going<br/>to take the job,
but you might as well get<br/>a great meal out of the deal.
You were pushing him into taking<br/>that high-paying corporate job.
I know.
It's terrible that I was<br/>trying to get him to do that.
Terrible? He has to take it.
I mean, how else are you going<br/>to pay off all that debt?
Lily, you have to tell him about this<br/>before he turns down that job.
You're right.<br/>I feel awful.
You know there is sale...
We are not going shoping.
There is.<br/>come on. let's go.
Why do I get so nervous<br/>around celebrities?
Hi, Ted Mosby.
I'm Ted Mosby.
Ted Mosby, it's you.
Have we met?
Mr. Mosby, it is an<br/>honor to meet you, sir.
Starney Binson.<br/>Barney Stinson.
Damn it.
We have met.
My real name is Steve Biel.
When I was in fourth grade,<br/>you were in ninth,
and, and one day<br/>I was out behind the school
and a bunch<br/>of seventh graders
were just beating<br/>the crap out of me.
Oh, yeah, I remember.<br/>That was you?
Yeah,<br/>but you pulled them off me.
You told them to go pick<br/>on someone their own size.
Huh.
I vowed right then that<br/>when I made something of myself,
I would honor you somehow.
So you took my name and starred in<br/>WelcomeTo The Sex Truck?
Yeah.
Um, yeah, listen, Ted,<br/>you got to stop use my name.
I-I'm trying to make a career<br/>as an architect.
Architect, huh?
You mean like a sex architect?
What?
Yeah, you know,<br/>you're on to something.
That would make a<br/>great title of a film.
Ted Mosby,<br/>Sex Architect.
You know, I'm actually looking<br/>for a new project
to shoot next Friday afternoon.
Yeah, listen, isn't,<br/>isn't there some other way
you could honor me?
With all due respect.
Wait, you're not mad, are you?
Oh, man, I knew it.
My father said,<br/>"Just plant a tree in Israel."
I'm such an idiot.
I guess<br/>I thought you'd be psyched.
I am.
I am;<br/>it's just
I feel a little guilty<br/>because I'm not
the one who saved<br/>you that day.
The guy<br/>who actually saved you was...
named... Lance Hardwood.
Lance Hardwood, yeah.
Really?<br/>Mm.
You know,<br/>you might not know this,
but in my business,<br/>that's kind of a killer name.
Yeah, I guess,<br/>I guess it is.
I can see the poster now.
Lance Hardwood, Sex Architect.
Starring...<br/>Ted Mosby.
I love it.
Marshall and Jeff stayed<br/>pretty late at the restaurant.
They stayed so late that<br/>Marshall crashed on Jeff's couch,
and the next day,
Marshall took part<br/>in a Sunday morning tradition
as old as the city itself:<br/>the Walk of Shame,
the long journey home after<br/>doing something you regret the night before.
I'll take the job.
That's awesome!
Yeah!<br/>Yeah!
Great time<br/>last night.
I'll call you later.
He's not going<br/>to call you.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
Um, did you get my message?<br/>I just,
- I crashed uptown.<br/>- Yeah, yeah.
Listen, I have, uh,<br/>something to tell you.
Uh, I have something<br/>I need to tell you also.
Mine's pretty huge.
You go first.
- Well...<br/>- I took the job.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I was drunk,
and it was a haze of cigars<br/>and scotch and Swayze,
and they offered<br/>me, like,
like, like, like,<br/>a lot of money.
Oh, Marshall.
How much money?
Here.
Whee!<br/>Yeah!
It's completely despicable.
I know, I know, I sold out
for a huge pile<br/>of disgusting money,
disgusting money that could<br/>help our future family
have some financial security
and could help pay<br/>for law school.
Law school.
Law school that I went to<br/>to help protect the environment,
not help destroy it.
And for what?
For, for... a lot of money.
Okay, okay,<br/>you've got to stop screaming.
Listen,<br/>Marshall,
you know what I like to do<br/>in situations like this?
Ted, if you say<br/>make a list of pros and cons,
I'm going to smack you.
I wasn't going to say that.
Okay, two beers,
and Ted, here's that yellow<br/>legal pad you asked for.
Yellow legal pad?
I ordered fries.
Maybe you should use this<br/>to write down people's orders.
Guys, I,<br/>I don't know what to do.
Take the money.
Money is good,<br/>money is happiness.
If I work there,
I'll be representing the most<br/>evil corporations in the world.
Kind of sounds<br/>like a pro and con list to me.
Lily, you have<br/>to tell him.
You can help him<br/>make this decision.
Oh, I think he's doing fine<br/>on his own.
All right.
Marshall,
I have something to say,<br/>and it's going to help you make your decision.
Oh, of course, you know<br/>my heart better than I do.
You know what's best<br/>for me and for us.
Please, please<br/>tell me what to do.
I think you should take<br/>the job at the NRDC.
Of course I should,<br/>of course I should.
Guys,
I'm going to save<br/>the planet Earth.
I got to go call Jeff.
What is the<br/>matter with you?
I can't ask him<br/>to make himself miserable
because of a mistake I made.
It's my problem;<br/>I'll figure it out.
That's really sweet.
Are those new earrings?
What are you, my mom?
Jeff, hey, um, it's Marshall.
Hey, Marshall.
I have something<br/>that I need to tell you.
I feel really weird<br/>about doing this over the phone.
Then don't.
Before you say<br/>anything,
come take a ride<br/>in this awesome limo with me.
Where are we going?
Tuckahoe Funland.
I'm sorry.
It sounded like you said<br/>Tuckahoe Funland,
the magic factory<br/>where dreams are made.
Get in.
Man, I-I love this place.
Me, too, buddy.
So what did you<br/>want to tell me?
I can't work for you.
I know, dude.
It's fine.
Marshall Eriksen wants to<br/>preserve the environment,
so that our children<br/>can enjoy it as we have.
I get it.
Good. Thank you.
I look down and see children<br/>enjoying this place.
Yeah, because somebody fought<br/>to preserve it.
If they ever shut this place<br/>down, it would be a tragedy.
Well, the good news is,<br/>that'll never happen.
You won't let it.
Because when<br/>you work for us,
your only client will be<br/>this place...
Tuckahoe Funland.
I'm taking the job.
Hey!<br/>All right.
And the best part is<br/>I'm not even going to be representing
some sort of evil corporation.
I will be representing<br/>Tuckahoe Funland,
the least evil place<br/>in the world.
Or so Marshall thought.
Great news,<br/>great news.
Uh-oh.
Oh, I'd better check<br/>on him.
Got it.
Terrific.
You'll notice I'm<br/>in the credits.
I did some location scouting.
Here are the plans for the new<br/>International Sex Building.
Wow, that really looks<br/>like our apartment.
It is.
Oh, I should return these.
Oh, Sex Architect,<br/>you've done it again.
Let's go celebrate<br/>on the couch.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, everybody makes mistakes.
Take this girl Meg for instance.
She made a mistake,<br/>a mistake named Barney.
Yeah,
I thought I was gonna get<br/>married to my last boyfriend
but, boy, did that guy<br/>have commitment issues.
That whole relationship...
that's three weeks of my life<br/>I'll never get back.
Well, I love commitment.
I wish I could marry commitment.
- I met a girl last night.<br/>- Really?
So perky and full of life and not at all fake.
You're talking about her boobs, right?
C?
And that wasn't Spanish,<br/>that was cup size.
What up?
- So, these boobs...<br/>- Hmm.
paint me a word picture.
All right, Ted.
Imagine the heads of two Irish babies.
Mmm.
Let's call them...
and...
Please stop!
When you get married,
you start outgrowing certain<br/>parts of your life.
And for Lily and Marshall,
those certain parts were,
for the most part,
me.
Why would you come in?
You heard me shaving!
I thought you were shaving your face!
Well, clearly I wasn't!
- Oh!<br/>- No, no!
- Pay up!<br/>- Ugh!
Hussy!
- Guys.<br/>- Hussy? What?
Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning
and it reeks in here.
Ted said it was okay.
Ah, hey, Marshall.
You're still up?
Aren't you taking the bar tomorrow?
Discontent was bubbling under the surface,
until one day...
Ted!
How many times have I<br/>asked you to put the lid
back on the peanut butter jar?
It's this sort of inconsiderate,
immature jackassery that makes me feel<br/>like I'm living in the Real World house,
and not the early years...
when they all had jobs<br/>and social consciences.
I'm talking about Hawaii and after!
I can't take this anymore!
Ted, Lily and I are married now!
It's time!
We're getting our own place!
Actually,
I left the lid off.<br/>Sorry, baby.
But still, it was time to move forward.
So, they set out to find<br/>a new apartment to rent.
Hey, here's one.
Pre-war building,<br/>recently renovated,
hardwood floors,
tons of light,
two bedroom, two bath.
Oh, yeah, but that one's not for rent.
It's for sale.
Oh, right.
Kids, Uncle Marshall always likes to say
that he had made three big mistakes<br/>in his life.
This was the first.
Jump,<br/>you big chicken!
Jump!<br/>You afraidy cat!
Jump!<br/>Jump!
This was the second.
No!
And this was the third and biggest.
We should buy a place!
What?
Baby, real estate is always<br/>a good investment.
It's not.
And the market is really hot right now.
It wasn't.
And because of my new job,
we are in such a strong place financially.
They weren't.
Because lily had a secret
Hi.
My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.
Hi, Lily.
Oh, you guys don't do that here?
Sorry.
Proceed.
I buy designer clothes and accessories
that I can't afford.
I have 15 credit cards,<br/>and they're all maxed out.
And no one outside of this room,<br/>not even my husband, knows.
And I, I feel terrible
because all I want to do<br/>right now is ask you
where you got those shoes.
They're adorable.
We can't buy; we have debt.
Yeah, I know,
my student loans are pretty big.
I forgive you.
What?
Well.. I'm just saying as your wife,
you know, I'm cool that you spent tens<br/>of thousands of dollars
on a brand name law school.
Because I know it makes you feel<br/>good and pretty.
Let's just go take a look at this place.
Where is it?
Uh, it's in a neighborhood called...
Dowisetrepla?
Dowisetrepla.
Oh, I see, you're not New Yorkers.
Oh, actually we live<br/>on the Upper West Side, so...
No need to be embarrassed,
listen, here in New York
we just shorten the names<br/>of all the neighborhoods,
SoHo, TriBeCa, Nolita...
Oh, right.
Dowisetrepla.
No, I'm, I'm from New York.
I know this neighborhood.
I'm down with D-town.
Oh, well,<br/>nobody calls it D-town.
Dowisetrepla is the up-and-coming<br/>neighborhood.
And I have to tell you,<br/>for these prices,
you're not going to be able to find another...
I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Don't bother with the hard sell.
This place is, is way out of our price range,
and besides, we've only<br/>just started to looking.
Is what Marshall should have said.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I love it!<br/>Let's get it!
Thank you, guys,<br/>for coming down here so quickly.
I've never been to this neighborhood.
Kind of thought this part<br/>of town was water.
No, dude.
This is Dowisetrepla.
- Dowisetrepla?<br/>- Yeah.
Is that an abbreviation for something?
He's from Ohio.
- Dowisetrepla is the<br/>up-and-coming neighborhood.
Oh.
I think this might be the place where<br/>Lily and I start a family.
I can see it now.
Two, three, four.
All right, bring it home, boys.
Sounds great, boys.
Who wants chocolate pancakes?
Thanks, Mommy!
Man,
life is gonna be sweet!
Oh, my God,
Lily, have you seen this kitchen?
- I know.<br/>- It's...
Isn't it amazing?
- I just love it so...<br/>- What the hell are you doing?
You can't buy this place.
Lily, you have a debt<br/>the size of Mount Waddington!
Waddington?
It's the tallest mountain in Canada.
It's like 4,000 meters high.
Meters?
Don't let Marshall fall in love<br/>with this apartment.
I know, I know,<br/>I know, I know,
but what do I tell him?
I-I don't know,<br/>tell him, um,
tell him you saw a ghost.<br/>Tell him it's haunted.
You really don't know Marshall at all.
So, uh, the owners,
- where are they?<br/>- Oh.
They're on vacation in France
- for two of weeks.<br/>- I see.
Between you and me,
I'm also interested in the apartment.
So is there any way I could come back later<br/>and check it out
while you're showing them other places?
The lock bar's combination is
1421.
And here is my card.
Are you serious?
You're trying to snake this apartment away<br/>from Marshall and Lily?
Ted, do you think I have<br/>no morals whatsoever?
I simply want to fool a girl into thinking<br/>this is my apartment
so I can nail her once<br/>and never have to see her again.
I'm not a monster.
Now, listen, I don't want to put a lot<br/>of pressure on you,
but there is one other<br/>couple that's expressed...
very serious interest.
I see what you're doing here.
"Another couple."
Please.
That crap is page one<br/>out of the Realtor's playbook.
And we're not buying it.
Is what Marshall should have said.
Another couple?
No!
We want it.<br/>Sell it to us.
We'll give you so much more money.
Oh, Marshall,<br/>can I talk to you?
Marshall, I just...
I don't know if now is the right time to buy.
But we're not doing this for now,
we're doing this for our future.
Can't you imagine starting a family here?
Oh, Persephone!
Oh, Daphne!
These'll be a perfect additions to our...
upcoming mother-daughter<br/>exhibit at the Met.
Looks great, girls.
Who wants cr?pes au chocolat?
Merci, papa!
So... what do you guys think?
Oh...
I love it, but Marshall,
I should have told you this a long time ago.
We can't afford to buy an apartment
because I have too much credit card debt.
I am so sorry.
Is what she should have said.
I love it. Let's get it.
Can we charge it?
To Lily and Marshall and<br/>their momentous step...
forward into adulthood.
Cheers.
Chug! Chug! Chug!<br/>Chug! Chug! Chug!
- Drink it! - Yes! Well done.<br/>- Nice! - Yeah!
Anything else?
Yes.
I've been staring at that thing for years.
Wendy,
bring me the comically large<br/>bottle of champagne
Really? Are you sure?
It's never been refrigerated.
And I think at some point there<br/>was a fish in it.
Honey, once you've made the sale,
stop sellin'.
All right, but you guys<br/>have to help me carry it.
All right, let's do it.<br/>Let's do it. Let's go. Hmm.
I know what you're thinking.
I should tell Marshall the truth.
Hey, I've got the whole thing figured out.
We'll apply for the loan<br/>under Marshall's name,
and he'll never need to know.
And then in the meantime,<br/>I'll slowly work down my debt.
Right after I furnish the apartment.
I saw this amazing leather sofa today.
You should be a reality show.
Nice!
Nice.
Wait!
That cork is the size of a softball
and you're pointing it directly<br/>at Wendy the waitress's face.
Is what he should have said.
Now if you're thinking<br/>of buying an apartment
it's always good to check the place out<br/>at night.
Welcome to my humble abode.
This place is so nice.
Ah, make yourself at home.
Please, get comfortable.
If you see something you like,<br/>just take it.
Who are these people?
Uh...
that's my parents.
They're Asian.
Yeah.
They're a Chinese couple<br/>that wanted a white baby.
It works both ways.
Cookie.
Wow.
Did you make those?
You got me.
My sisters taught me how to bake
and how to listen.
Wow.
I feel so at home here.
I'm glad.
Sometimes, I don't.
A place like this really<br/>needs a lady of the house.
I know it's too early<br/>to be thinking of you as...
Oh, God, I'm freaking you out, aren't I?
It's just you make me feel so safe...
I didn't...
The next day,
Lily and Marshall went to<br/>the mortgage broker...
to get a loan.
Hey, uh, can we get this in singles?
Before we get the apartment<br/>I want to put in a kiddie pool
and swim around in it naked.
- Great,<br/>- that is great!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, all right,<br/>back to business now.
All right, Mrs. Aldrin,<br/>I'm going to need your social as well.
What? Why?
I mean, you already have Marshall's.
Yes, but since you're a married couple,
you'll be applying for a joint loan, so...
Well, can we just go ahead and do it<br/>in my husband's name?
He's the head of the household.
He earns the big bucks.
I mean, can women even own property?
Go ahead, just give him your social.
Okay, my...<br/>my social is, uh...
Got it.
Okay.
Let's see what kind of rate<br/>I can get you two.
Under six percent.<br/>Under six percent.
Under six percent, please.
There we go.<br/>Congratulations.
You have been approved for a loan at 18%.
No, way. That-that can't be right.
You're lucky to be getting a mortgage.
Let's get out of here, Marshall.
Hold it, I-I don't understand.
Did we do something wrong or...?
You have quite a bit of debt.
My student loans. Great.
I thought we were friends.
You know what, it's fine to penalize me for<br/>trying to get an education and build a career,
but I will not let you<br/>deprive my beautiful wife...
of her dream home just because I...
Okay, actually, it's because<br/>of your wife's credit card debt.
Oh, my God.
Marshall, there's something<br/>I have to tell you,
and I want you to hear it from me first.
okay, so, let me get this straight.
You just snuck this girl<br/>into some stranger's apartment?
Yeah, we spent the night.
Hey, look at you.
Hey.
I'm wearing your bathrobe.
I hope you don't mind.
The only thing missing<br/>from that bathrobe are your initials.
My mom's gonna be in town next week.
Is it okay if she stays with us?
Only if she sleeps in the bed
and I sleep on the couch.
You're so sweet.
I love you.
There, I said it and I'm not taking it back.
Oh, my God!
I love you, too.
I'm finally not the first one to say it!
How about you get in the shower,
and I will make us some waffles.
Works every time.
Wait.
That time that you offered to walk my dogs
when I went to visit my dad in Vancouver...
Yup.
Is that why my Yorkie trembled
for like a week after I got back?
Yeah.
That little guy saw some<br/>stuff I'm not proud of.
- Whoa.<br/>- What?
There was a fight here.
What do you mean?
Whenever Marshall and Lily have<br/>a big argument,
they always leave a trail of evidence<br/>all over the apartment.
Oh, God, here we go.
He had a detective club as a kid.
Uh, the Mosby Boys cracked<br/>a lot of big cases.
The Mosby Boys?
You mean you and your sister.
We solved the mystery<br/>of the missing retainer.
Hmm, let me guess: it was in the garbage.
Why are you like this?
Anyway, this is serious.
I know Lily and Marshall.
All the telltale signs are here.
Like this.
- A water bottle?<br/>- Don't touch the evidence!
I got your back, partner.
It's not just any water bottle.
Notice the label is peeled off.
Lily always peels labels off
the bottlewhen she's feeling guilty.
This label is not only peeled<br/>off, but torn up.
Oh, man, she must have<br/>done something bad.
Which means Marshall<br/>must have been really angry,
and when Marshall gets really angry...
he eats.
Just as I suspected,
Cherry Garcia.
Given the liquid consistency,
I place the fight between...
noon and 1:00.
Ew, that was on the floor.
If you want to get to the bottom of this,
you're gonna need a stronger stomach<br/>than that, doll-face.
Marshall stood here.
Eating and yelling,<br/>yelling and eating.
Lily stood here.
Crying.
Ew, Ted.
And then Marshall tried to storm out...
but Lily
went for the Hail Mary pass.
Which would mean...
What do you think,<br/>makeup sex?
No. There'd be a bigger mess.
Tempted as he was,<br/>Marshall was still too upset.
He had to get out of here,<br/>any way he could.
He chose the door,
slamming it behind him.
Which is why this picture is crooked.
Nice catch, rook.
I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab.
Now all we need is a motive.
The million-dollar question.
What were they fighting about?
I know what they've been fighting...
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
There's only one possible conclusion.
Lily and Marshall were fighting about:
- peanut butter.<br/>- Ah.
Lily left the lid off...
then Marshall blew his.
I know what they were fighting about,
and it wasn't peanut butter.
- Robin, just...<br/>- I appreciate your help,
but there's a reason your<br/>name is Robin, not Batman.
Just...
They were fighting<br/>because they didn't get the loan
and it's all Lily's fault.
- Robin, just...<br/>- What?
Yeah, she has a pile of debt<br/>the size of Mount... Rushmore.
Nice try, Robin.
So, the next thing Lily did
was give Marshall<br/>a few hours to cool off about
the peanut butter.
Then she called him to apologize,<br/>which is why the last number dialed is...
Greenstein and Lee,<br/>Divorce Attorneys.
This can't be happening.
They can't...
get divorced.
Not Lily and Marshall, no way.
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.
- What do you mean?<br/>- Well...
Marshall's gonna get you guys,<br/>Lily's gonna get me.
Even if they did break up,<br/>that doesn't mean we can't all still hang out.
I mean we broke up and we still hang out.<br/>It's not weird.
It's a little weird.
Yeah, it is.
It's weird.
The world needs Marshall<br/>and Lily... together.
I'm not crying,<br/>there's something in my eye.
They're back.
- Hey, hey, guys.<br/>- Hey.
We have an announcement.
I know, it's a terrible idea.
You can't do it!
Just look at me.
Oh...
I hit redial on the phone.
Divorce lawyers?
Oh, I should explain.
We got in a pretty big fight.
Yeah,
I know.
Marshall stormed out.
I went, uh, to the bar.
Still drinking that?
I paid for it.
And apparently money's tight now, so...
Listen,
I've been thinking about this,
and I know there's no way<br/>to undo what I've done,
but, well,
I made an appointment<br/>with a divorce lawyer.
What?!
- What?!<br/>- Oh, no, no, no, no-no.
- What, you want a divorce now?<br/>- No. I just mean on paper,
so that you can buy the apartment
- without my bad credit dragging us down.<br/>- Lily...
are you trying to kill me?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have led<br/>with the divorce lawyer part.
No, you shouldn't have.
I love you, Lily.
I love you, too.
And I want us to have our dream home.
And, well, I don't know.
It seems like this is a way to do it.
So...
Marshall Eriksen,
will you divorce me?
That's the sweetest divorce proposal<br/>I've ever heard.
So is that a yes?
You can't sleep with other women though.
No, we're not getting divorced,
not even on paper.
When I married you,<br/>I married your problems, too.
The ones I knew about<br/>and the ones I didn't.
So, that was the deal.
We'll figure this out together.
Can I get you guys anything else?
So you're not getting a divorce?
- No.<br/>- Wow, you guys scared us.
Oh, thank God.
'Cause, I mean if you did,
then who'd be the lame married couple<br/>I get to make fun of?
Like, "Hey, Marshall,<br/>you married Miss Right.
You just didn't know her<br/>first name was Always."
That stuff is gold.
So, what's the announcement?
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.
We told her that, uh,<br/>because of our finances,
we're not getting the place.
It's just... it's not the right time.
Is what Marshall should have said.
I just got off the phone with the realtor.
We got the place!
We're homeowners!
- Don't do it. - Are you insane?<br/>- Have you lost your mind?
Is what we should have said.
Yes! Congratulations!<br/>That's awesome!
- This is exciting.<br/>- Yeah.
There it is!
Our new home.
Shall we?
We shall.
- Oh!<br/>- Oh!
Oh, what a horrible smell.
It reeks.
Oh, that's just the plant.
Don't worry, they shut it<br/>down on the weekends.
Wh-What plant?<br/>What are you talking about?
Don't you know?
Baby, this whole neighborhood<br/>is downwind of the sewage treatment plant.
Wait...
what did you just say?
I said, we're downwind of the sewage<br/>treatment plant.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, the early bloom of a romance<br/>is a wonderful thing.
You meet someone,
you have a connection,
and that person becomes sheer perfection<br/>in your eyes.
You just can't find<br/>anything wrong with them.
You can't wait to tell the world about it.
She convinced you to go jogging?
Wow, you really want to get<br/>in this girl's pants.
I'm telling you,<br/>you guys are gonna love her.
Lily, she knows all about art.
Marshall, she's open to the<br/>existence of UFOs.
Barney, she's hot.
Robin, she's not hotter than you.
- Like her already.<br/>- How not hotter?
So we all went out to dinner,
and I couldn't wait to see if my friends were<br/>as crazy about Cathy as I was.
So, what's everyone getting?
Well, I can't decide.
Which sounds better,<br/>chicken or lasagna?
Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!
Oh. You guys just got a new place.
How many bedrooms is it?
Two. It's two bedrooms!
Okay!
Let's hear it.
What's wrong with Cathy?
Are you kidding me, Ted?
- She's got a...<br/>- wait.
You don't notice it?
Notice what?
Oh, he doesn't see it.
If we point it out, we're<br/>gonna ruin her for him.
As his friends,<br/>we'll just keep him in the dark.
You're right.
She's great, man.
She's a keeper. Just...
keep her somewhere else.
Marshall, what is everyone's<br/>problem with Cathy?
Oh, she's a total nightmare,<br/>Ted,
but can we talk about this later?
I'm a minute away from finding out<br/>if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.
You see, kids,<br/>during the summer,
Marshall had taken the New York Bar exam.
His years of school,<br/>his countless hours of study,
had finally culminated in this<br/>grueling, two-day ordeal.
And...
begin.
The pressure of it was enormous.
Every year, people taking<br/>the bar simply cracked.
No!
No!
No!
No!
But Marshall had made it through.
And...
time.
Time's up.
Right.
Time.
- Sir.<br/>- I know.
- Your time is...<br/>- I know it is.
Give me...!
Now, months later,
the results of that exam were scheduled<br/>to post online at 10:00,
and it was 9:59.
Damn, they're not up yet.
Oh, don't worry, baby.<br/>I'm sure you rocked it.
I mean, how many people fail the bar?
Half.
Oh, my God, half?
Only half the people pass?
I mean, half the people pass.
That's fantastic.
Go, Marshall.
Oh, hey, can I jump on there?
- I want to show you something awesome.<br/>- What?
No. Bar results. My future.
Trust me. You need to see this.
What is so important<br/>that I need to see it right now?
It's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.
How do I need to see that?
Why would I want to see that?
In what possible way
could subjecting my eyes and my brain...
to something that<br/>disgusting enrich my life?
It's a dog pooping on a baby.
Get away from my computer.
Okay, just do a quick Google<br/>search for "caca spaniel."
The results are in.
Whoo. What's it say?
"Input password."
oh, Input the password.
It's okay. They assigned it<br/>to me when I took the test.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
Here. Here-here-here.
Jelly beans, fluffernutter,<br/>Gummi Bears, ginger snaps...
This is a grocery list.
For who? A witch building<br/>a house in the forest?
Sugar helps me study.
This is like the shopping<br/>a ten-year-old does
when his parents leave him alone<br/>for the weekend.
What parent leaves a ten-year-old alone<br/>for the weekend?
And your mom was perfect.
- I can't find my password!
Okay, just can't you let<br/>'em know that you lost it
and they'll e-mail it to you or something?
No! They won't let me do that.
I'm gonna have to wait till the results come<br/>in the regular mail.
That could be weeks from now,<br/>if ever!
Our mail carrier hates me...
ever since I asked her<br/>when the baby was due.
She wasn't pregnant?
No, he was not.
Ooh.
Okay, well, that's a drag,<br/>but the results will come eventually.
Just try to keep it off your mind until then.
Hey, Brad.
Oh, congratulations, man.
I'm, uh...
I'm not sure yet.
I lost my password.
That's great, Cara.
I don't know yet.<br/>I lost my password.
I don't know how I lost it!
This stuff happens!
Oh. Ohh! You're one to talk.
You misplace stuff all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure the nurses are<br/>stealing your medicine, Grandma.
Love you, too.
If I have to wait six weeks<br/>to find out if I passed,
I-I'm gonna have a heart attack.
Based on that grocery list, I'd<br/>say diabetes is a bigger worry.
You know what?<br/>Laugh all you want.
This affects my whole future, all right?
Okay.
I probably shouldn't be telling you this.
I definitely shouldn't be telling you this,
but there is a way I can<br/>help you with your problem.
How?
I know a guy at work.
He can get access to software<br/>designed to penetrate firewalls
and retrieve passwords<br/>through secure servers.
I can get into any computer.
So what do we do? Like, arrange a secret<br/>meeting in a darkened parking structure?
No.
Can we?
No.
I have a trench coat.
Dude, be cool.
So, I just got off the phone with Cathy.
God, you guys are so right.
I totally hear it now.
See it now?
Smell it?
What is it?!
I left the table for two minutes.
What could she have possibly<br/>done in that time...
that was so horrible?
Was it...
I'll be back in one second.
One time, in the tenth grade,<br/>as a joke,
I told everyone that my English teacher<br/>had sex with me.
He's still in jail.
Or maybe...
I'll be back in a second.
So I volunteer at the pound.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Yeah.
You can't imagine the rush you get<br/>from killing an unwanted puppy.
I make bracelets out of the collars.
Or...
I'll be back in one second.
I bet he's going to the urinal.
Yeah.
I remember when I had a penis.
It wasn't anything she did<br/>while you were in the bathroom.
It's just the way she is.
I don't get it.
If it's so obvious and you guys all see it,
how come I don't?
'Cause we're not trying<br/>to have sex with her.
Mmm.
Brother, you're driving the "I want<br/>to have sex with her" truck,
and it's got a huge blind spot.
That's ridiculous.
Is it really?
Ted, let me tell you a little<br/>story about a young lady
I wanted to have sex with...
Lucilia.
On a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro,
we made love for ten straight hours.
When we were done,
she applauded
and told me I was far, far better
than the best lover<br/>she could possibly imagine,
and that I had restored her faith in God.
What does this have to do with Cathy?
Who's Cathy?
Just tell me what the hell<br/>is wrong with her already.
Okay.
You want to know?
Yes.
You want to shatter this beautiful illusion<br/>you've created for yourself?
Fine. Here it is.
Cathy talks...
a lot.
Oh, come on.
That's not true.
Ted. Really, really think about that dinner<br/>we all just had together.
And I did.
So, what's everyone getting?
Well, I can't decide.
Which sounds better,<br/>chicken or lasagna?
I like chicken. I like lasagna.<br/>I like them both,
but I really like pork.
A lot of people don't eat pork,
and maybe it's because<br/>of that movie Babe or something.
But that was funny.
He was a talking pig<br/>and he was like "Bah, Ram, Ewe!"
What-what if there was a sorority,<br/>"Bah, Ram, Ewe?"
I'd totally rush it.
...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!
Lorax is a funny word.
Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!
Oh, you guys just got a new place.
How many bedrooms is it?
I would love to have an extra bedroom,
because I would put a Stairmaster in there.
But you guts should get a convertible sofa.
Or a futon.<br/>Futons are great.
Or what about one of those Murphy beds?
Who invented the Murphy bed?
Was it a guy named Murphy?
Oh, my God.
Do you guys remember<br/>thatshow Murphy Brown?
That was a funny show.
She had a new assistant every episode.
...and it was like half an<br/>hour before I realized...
he wasn't even on the phone anymore!
Isn't that hysterical?
Two! It's two bedrooms!
Hey, do you guys like cannolis?
Because I know this place<br/>and it's in the South Bronx
and you wouldn't expect it,
but they have the best cannolis in town.
And just like that,<br/>the illusion was shattered.
Wow.
She just never shuts up, does she?
She didn't stop to swallow her food.
I was scared for her.
I didn't want her to choke.
so, kids, this girl i was dating<br/>would not stop talking.
Can you imagine how awful that is?
Do you own a wok?
'Cause that's really how...
Don't you just love autumn?
Today I'm dressed for...
Oh, my God.
The sweetest thing.
And I know this great place<br/>where we can go.
They have guys and girls clothes.
We could both shop at the same time.
And a lot of times boyfriends<br/>and girlfriends...
Hey!
Why are you running so fast?
Well, thank you, pal.
You and your little friends,
you just had to tell me.
You just had to give in<br/>to my incessant begging.
You said that you wanted to know.
I didn't want to know!
You said you wanted to know!
Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know!
You knew.<br/>And you know me.
And you should have known<br/>I didn't want to know!
You know?
I'm sorry we told you.
I'm surprised she didn't tell<br/>you herself at some point.
There's only a finite combination of words<br/>in the English language.
Well, you could have let me<br/>enjoy it a little longer.
She's got all these other great qualities.
She's smart.
She's caring.
She loves animals...
You know how to teach her a lesson?
Buy her a parrot.
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry that we told you, okay?
It's part of being in a relationship.
Eventually, you get used<br/>to these annoying little things
that bug you at first.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, you got used<br/>to Lily's loud chewing, right?
Lily doesn't chew loudly.
Dude...
Come on. This isn't news.
Why do you think I call her "Chewbacca"?
I assumed because she's loyal,<br/>wears shiny belts
and I resemble a young Harrison Ford.
Think about it.
Oh, man,
honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing<br/>you've ever done to me.
I really thought you knew.
We had ribs the other night.<br/>It sounded like Jurassic Park.
Ha-ha-ha.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
But it did.
Say, what's in that cereal besides dry twigs<br/>and small animal bones?
What's that supposed to mean?
Lily, I love you,<br/>but honest to God,
when you eat, it sounds<br/>like a garbage disposal...
full of drywall screws.
What's the matter with you?
We've been together ten years,<br/>and you're saying this now?
Well, I never noticed it before until...
Until what?
Can you believe Ted?
What a lame thing to say,<br/>that I'm a loud chewer.
Yeah, that's crazy.
Maybe enough with the pretzels.
Oh, my God, do I really chew that loudly?
No, no, no.
Okay, now that you pointed it out,
maybe it does sound slightly like...
someone put a screwdriver<br/>in a pencil sharpener,
but in a cute way.
This is all Ted's fault.
Oh, like he's so perfect,<br/>Mr. Corrector.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on.
You dated the guy for a year
and you never noticed<br/>that most of what Ted says
is correcting you.
Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?
Actually, Kleenex is a brand.
This is a facial tissue.
Oh, my God, is Frankenstein<br/>gonna kill that little girl?
Uh, Dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene.
That's Frankenstein's monster.
That literally blew my mind.
Figuratively.
Oh, my God, you're right.
That is so annoying.
Isn't it?
Where are those pretzels from,<br/>Ace Hardware?
Hey, man, you like kettle corn?
I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.
Are the blinds closed?
I don't know.
Are the blinds closed?!
Yes, the blinds are closed.
Good, I didn't think I was followed,
but you can never be too sure.
Now double-lock the door
and stay away from the windows.
Is there a reason that<br/>you're acting like this?
We're about to find out if you're a lawyer.
Now, in good conscience,
I have to inform you that<br/>using this software...
is in violation of the Patriot Act,
the Strategic Defense Initiative,
and the National Security Act of 1948,
which created the CIA.
So I hope you passed the bar
because if we use this software,
the night janitor Gligor
who I fooled into putting<br/>fingerprints on my computer,
is going to need a good lawyer.
Are you certain you want<br/>to go through with this?
I have to know,<br/>yes, yes.
Very good.
First, we go to the New York<br/>State Bar Web site.
We disable the firewall,
then the recursive algorithm<br/>grabs your password,
and as the application erases itself<br/>leaving no trace we were here ever...
you ready to see your future, bro?
Yes.
It's a dog pooping on a baby.
Right!<br/>Isn't that awesome?
So you went through all this<br/>just to get me to look at your stupid video?
Yeah, it was worth it.
Barney, Barney, that was<br/>the biggest test of my life.
I'm incredibly stressed out<br/>right now, and I...
Okay, that's pretty funny.
Ted. You got to see this.
Uh-huh,
yeah, I have to...
She'll call back when she realizes I'm gone.
Probably in about 45 minutes.
Hey.
Hi.
You guys want a drink?
I'll just have a water.
Mm, technically,<br/>water is a drink.
Really, Professor?
You drink it?<br/>Is that how water works?
Because I was just gonna<br/>smear it on my skin
and hope that I absorbed it.
Or you could, you know,<br/>pour it over your shirt.
What's with you?
You're always correcting people.
- You totally do that!<br/>- That's absolutely right.
Right? I never noticed it before,
and now it's literally driving me crazy.
Figuratively.
Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse than you...
using the word "literally"<br/>in every other sentence.
Don't they teach vocabulary in Canada?
They literally don't.
They literally don't.
Shut up, Marshall.
That's nothing compared to<br/>your thing of singing...
what you do all the time.
What?
* Paying my bills<br/>using return address labels *
* From a charity<br/>that I haven't given money to *
* Writing a check 'cause now I feel guilty *
* The Salivation Army does not fight fair. *
* Heading down to the basement today *
* With my laundry and a roll of quarters *
* But I'm back too soon *
* 'Cause I left the detergent *<br/>* And the fabric softener *
Wow.<br/>Those lines are so sloppy.
Oh, come on!
What about you, "Barney"?
Okay, you...
always...
oh, Interesting, interesting,
everyone has annoying habits but me.
Oh,
got it.
Okay, you sometimes talk<br/>in a weird high-pitched voice.
And you're constantly using<br/>lame catchphrases.
And sometimes you space out
and don't even pay attention<br/>to what we're talking about.
I'm sorry. What?
Oh, see?
You can't think of anything
* 'Cause I'm awesome! *
All three right there.
Well, technically, "awesome"<br/>wouldn't be a catchphrase.
If anything,<br/>it's more of a catchword.
I literally want to rip your head off.
You mean "figuratively"!
No, I literally mean
"literally."
Literally, literally literally.
Oh, my God,
Lily, what are you eating, gravel?
Oh, I know, right?
It sounds like cufflinks<br/>going up a vacuum cleaner.
Well, why don't you sing about it?
Because I don't sing about everything I do.
No, no, sometimes you just sing<br/>nonsense sentences
like a stroke victim,
and what's worse,
they're catchy.
* Apple, orchard, banana,<br/>cat dance, 8663 *
See? We know that one<br/>because once you sang that
for, like, three hours.<br/>What the hell is that?
That's my password.
AOBCD8663.
- Oh, Marshall!<br/>- Awesome!
There's another one.
It's called "Golden<br/>Reliever," where this dog...
Yeah, we can guess.
All right, guys, guys, guys.
I'm a lawyer.
And just like that
we stopped fighting and<br/>celebrated Marshall's success.
You see, when someone's bad<br/>habits are pointed out to you,
it's hard to ignore them.
* I'm a lawyer now 'cause I passed the bar *
* I'm imposing Marshall law<br/>on this champagne. *
Are you literally on cloud nine right now?
Baby, you never have to take the bar again.
Actually, if he practices law<br/>in another state,
he will have to,
but New York, man!
It's a great state to practice law in!
Lawsuit up!
- Yeah!<br/>- Whoo!
- Yeah!<br/>- Yeah!
But if you love them enough,
those bad habits are easy to forget.
3 years later, i ran into cathy.
and she was doing well.
Ted?!
Oh, my God,<br/>I haven't seen you in so long!
How long has it been?<br/>Three years? No, four years.
No, three years, 'cause I went blonde<br/>and then I went back
'cause I was having too much fun.
It's true what they say:<br/>blondes have more fun.
Oh, my God, I'm being so rude.
Ted, this is my fiancee.
Yes, I'm engaged.
Ted, this is Daniel.
Daniel, this is Ted.
great.
great, nice to meet you.
You guys seem perfect for each other.
Oh, my God. I know, right? Totally,<br/>it was like love at first sight.
Hey, we should go out sometime.
Are you seeing anyone?
Because we could double-date.<br/>Is that weird? No, it's not.
We can go have brunch on this street.<br/>I know this place.
- Do you guys like popovers?<br/>- She sure can talk a lot, huh?
- Because I love popovers.<br/>- She sure can talk a lot, huh?
- They're like croissants,<br/>- She sure can talk a lot, huh?
but they're a little bit less<br/>flaky and they're kind of round.
Hey, they have strawberry jam.
[Glass Shattering]

[<div class="full-script">Back when we were dating,<br/>Robin and I had this running joke
We were the only two people in<br/>the world who found it funny
No way March just not have 31 days
Yes it does everyone knows that<br/>it's like general knowledge
general knowledge
And we did it all the time
Isn't it sad that I mean<br/>in 2007 some countries...
actually still condone corporal punishment
corporal punishment
Because once you start,<br/>it's surprisingly hard to stop
Oh man I got kernel stuck in my teeth
kernel stuck in my teeth
But now we were broken<br/>up so when Marshall said
but after the first year<br/>i get a major pay raise
We just let it slide
You see on the surface, Robin and I<br/>look like we were doing great
But the truth is trying to be friends with<br/>your ex is a lot hard than it looks.
You can't be as candid as you used to be.
So then this hot intern leans over my desk,
I can totally see she has a pierced...
Brosnan.
Pierce Brosnan is my<br/>favorite of all the Bonds.
But most importantly, you can<br/>never, ever be alone together.
I gotta go.
I'm gonna go pay.
Peeing.
- I'm gonna help Marshall pay.<br/>- I'm gonna help Lily pee.
All right, we have a turkey.
Yeah, we do.
Isn't this exciting?
Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.
Yeah, this is gonna be<br/>the best Slapsgiving ever.
What?
I said this is going to be<br/>the best Thanksgiving ever.
Yeah, this is going to be great.
Just the five of us, right?
Oh, uh, that reminds me: I invited Bob.
Bob?
You've been on, like, three<br/>dates with that guy.
We haven't even met him.
Well, he didn't have anywhere else<br/>to go, and I didn't know what to say.
- Is it really that big a deal?<br/>- Yes.
This is our first Thanksgiving.
30 years from now, we're going<br/>to look at the photos and say,
"Oh, there's the four people I<br/>love most in the world.And Bob."
I'm sorry, sometimes I forget how seriously<br/>you guys take American Thanksgiving.
Real Thanksgiving<br/>happened over a month ago.
I'm sorry.
Did you just say Canadian<br/>Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,
"the real Thanksgiving"?
What do Canadians even<br/>have to celebrate about?
Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates<br/>explorer Martin Frobisher's valiant yet
ultimately unsuccessful attempt<br/>to find the Northwest Passage.
Why are you guys even a country?
Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone<br/>wants to come over early Thursday,
we can watch the Slapsgiving Day Parade.
Well, there, you said it again.
Said what?
Slapsgiving.
Oh, I guess I did.
You know why? I've invented<br/>a new holiday: Slapsgiving.
It's the one day we set aside each<br/>year to gather together and give slaps.
I should explain.
Kids, you remember the slap bet.
A yearlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney<br/>and won the right to slap him five times.
He had already used the first.
And the second.
But Marshall had something<br/>special in store for the third.
No.
No, no.
The countdown ends at 3:00<br/>p.m. the day after Thanksgiving.
I counted it out.
How many days are in October?
Uh, thirty.
Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.
I like Halloween very much. Is nice.
Is also tomorrow.
Damn it!
Wait, you're gonna slap<br/>me on Thanksgiving?
Slapsgiving.
That's not allowed.
Lily, you're the Slap Bet<br/>Commissioner, is that allowed?
The hostess in me who's<br/>using her wedding...
china for the first time wants to say hell, no,
but yeah,I'm going to allow it.
Well, you know what?
If you're trying to freak me out<br/>about spending Thanksgiving...
Slapsgiving.
At your place, then you failed.
- Truth is,I'm not scared.<br/>- Really?
Right. 'Cause you blew it.
The worst part about getting slapped is<br/>not knowing when it's going to happen.
But now I know exactly<br/>when I'm gonna get slapped.
So, you took all the suspense out.
You showed your hand.
And Thursday at 3:01 p.m.
your face is going to show my hand.
Oh, there's Bob!
By the way, heads up, he's<br/>a little bit older than us.
How old is he?
He's forty-one.
Hey, Bob! Over here!
Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob<br/>probably looked like this.
- Hey, sweetie.<br/>- Hi.
But when your ex is dating<br/>someone new, your...
mind tends to accentuate their flaws.
This is how I saw Bob.
Hey, dudes, what's crackin'?
- Hey, man, how are you?<br/>- Good to meet you.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got off the phone with my parents.
Parents?
They were totally on my case:
"What are you gonna do with<br/>your life? You're forty-one."
And I'm like,"Chillax, snowboarding<br/>is a legit career.
You ought to be stoked I found my bliss."
And speaking of bliss, sugar me, baby.
Let's go get a drink.
Unbelievable.
Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.
What are you talking about?
He's forty-one. He looks great.
Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape.
probably could kick your ass.
How are you guys not seeing this?
He's 150; Robin's 27.
Barney, come on, what do you got?
Nothing but respect for that man.
Oh, by the way, we're all baking<br/>pies at Robin's tomorrow.
Marshall can't be trusted in the<br/>apartment with pies overnight.
For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a...
very serious and delicious<br/>medical condition.
Hey, uh, what time are you<br/>guys going to Robin's?
7:30.
Perfect. Just to be safe,I'll<br/>get there like 8:00,8:30.
{6}9:30 pm
Sorry I'm late.
Where are Marshall and Lily?
Uh, they just called.
They're both super swamped<br/>preparing for tomorrow.
Is Bob coming?
No, he went to see Green Day.
So it's...
- Just the two of us.<br/>- just the two of us.
- Making pies.<br/>- Pies.
They're things that friends make together.
Yeah, they do.
- Yeah.<br/>- Yeah.
- Great.<br/>- Yeah.
Great. Well, this is great.
It'll give us a chance to catch up.
Yeah.
- I'm going to make a phone call.<br/>- I'll put it in t oven.
Hey, it's me.
Listen, you have to come<br/>over here and make pies.
Yeah,I'll be there, absolutely.
Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver.
It's still kind of weird being alone<br/>with Robin, but if you were here...
Hey, say no more.
I mean, when I pulled you<br/>out of that burning wreckage,
I wasn't doing it to have<br/>a battleship named after me.
But if you insist, yes,I'll<br/>be there for the christening.
You're hitting on someone<br/>right now, aren't you?
No,I'm not going to<br/>wear the medal of honor.
That would just be tacky.
So you're not coming to make pies.
No, no.
Thank you, Mr.President.
Sorry.
After a very long night, it<br/>was finally the big holiday.
Sorry, the two big holidays.
Oh, Marshall, are you working<br/>on the cranberry sauce?
In a minute, baby.
I've only got so many hands.
You see what I got going on here?
They're turkeys, but they're also hands,
because later, we're going to eat turkey...
and then I'm going to slap you in your face.
Please, you took out all the suspense.
In a horror movie, the killer does<br/>not grab a bullhorn and announce,
Attention unsupervised<br/>teens here at the lake house:
At precisely 3:00 a.m. I'm gonna<br/>jump out of that closet right there
and hack you all up with a machete.
P.S. Fire is my one weakness.
Hey, Ted.
- Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>- You, too.
- Is Lily in the kitchen?<br/>- Yep.
Great.
- Marshall?<br/>- Lily?
- Yeah?<br/>- Uh-huh?
- Something really weird<br/>happened last night.
Something really weird<br/>happened last night.
what you mean something<br/>weird happened last night?
You may not realize this,<br/>but since we broke up,
Robin and I have never<br/>really been alone together.
So we're in the kitchen, starting<br/>on the pies, and we realize,
we don't have a damn<br/>thing to say to each other.
I mean, you can't talk about<br/>how close you used to be.
You can't talk about<br/>how close you're not now.
You just feel like everything you<br/>say is gonna make things worse.
Exactly.
And you know why?
Because you don't want<br/>to hurt someone you...
really care about, especially<br/>around the holidays.
I mean, what decent human<br/>being would want to...
cause any kind of emotional<br/>or physical pain...
You're still getting slapped.
I wanted to leave, but I couldn't stick<br/>her with making all the pies by herself.
She was exhausted.
I yawned like a million times<br/>trying to get him to leave.
Yeah, some people just can't take a hint.
By the way,I'm really swamped in here.
I kept looking at the clock<br/>and sighing... totally clueless.
I'm not sure I have time<br/>to mash those potatoes,
- you're standing right next to.<br/>- And then Ted does the thing that
- he always does when<br/>there's an awkward silence.
Yep.
Masher's right there, next to the pot.
He panics and says the first<br/>thing that pops into his head.
Hey, did you know that the first pies in<br/>recorded history came from ancient Egypt?
Remember last year's Thanksgiving,<br/>when we had sex seven times?
- Terrible.<br/>- What?
I thought it would break the ice.
I'd already broken the<br/>ice with my cool pie fact.
Then he makes it ten times more awkward.
How do you respond to<br/>something like that?
Did you know that the Egyptian<br/>pyramids can be seen from space?
Probably?
Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
Okay, um...
the pecan pie is gonna take the longest.
Why don't we put that one in first?
Pecan pie? Why are we making that?
Um, it's my favorite.
- You're allergic.<br/>- I know.
I just like smelling it.
It's like eating with your nose.
So we're making a pie for Bob.
Well... yeah.
- She's got you making pies for this guy?<br/>- Yeah.
That is a real slap in the face.
You know, you could have<br/>just told me it was for Bob.
Yeah,I-I just thought it might upset you.
Upset me?
Wait a second.
Do you think that...
do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?
I don't know.
Is it so ridiculous to<br/>think that you might be?
- Yes.<br/>- Why?
Because he's a thousand years old.
- No, Ted, what are you doing?<br/>- Right?
The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that...
we can only talk about<br/>the first Thanksgiving,
but he was actually there.
Come on.
The only reason I'm<br/>jealous of Bob is because
I heard Noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
Ted...
The only reason I'm jealous of<br/>Bob is that I'm just an architect,
but he discovered fire.<br/>How do you top that?
He's 41!
Why are you bashing on him so hard?
I'm not. I'm just joking around.
That's what friends do.
It's mean.
Well, how come we're all allowed to bust<br/>on Barney when he dates some skanktron,
but when you sleep with the Crypt
Keeper's dad,I'm not<br/>allowed to say a word?
First of all, Bob and I<br/>are not sleeping together.
We're just dating.
Secondly, have I said one word about<br/>the parade of dubious conquests
you've been marching past<br/>me the last few months?
One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?
- Hey, that is...<br/>- And if you and I are such good friends...
why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?
Yeah, if you and I are such good friends,
why couldn't you just tell<br/>me that's what we were doing?
Okay, maybe we should talk about this later.
I-I should get going.
Well, what are we doing?<br/>It's Thanksgiving.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
- This is stupid.<br/>- I'm sorry, too.
Of course we're friends.
- I'm glad we're friends.<br/>- Me too
you guys slept together last night?
That is a terrible idea!
Horrible idea.
Relapse five!
That's where we high-five, then<br/>it's awkward for a little bit...
and then we high-five again!
What the hell were you doing?
Let's review: You and Ted<br/>broke up six months ago,
Yep.
you're dating another man...
You are correct, sir.
who's coming to my Thanksgiving today...
That is a truth-fact.
an event Ted is also attending.
Ka-blammo.
Why are you trying to<br/>destroy American Thanksgiving?
Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds.
Bob anl aren't that serious, and what<br/>happened last night with Ted was a fluke.
Well, did you guys at least talk about it?
- There's office material...<br/>- I hear something burning...
Clearly, we need to ignore this.
Clearly, we need to talk about this.
You know? To save the friendship.
- We need to talk.<br/>- Stuffed mushroom?
We need to talk about last night.
Did you know thatsome<br/>mushrooms are carnivorous?
Probably... Not?
Ted, can we please just deal with this?
Look,I'mad. I just think...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why would you be mad... you started it?
What? You're crazy!
We called a truce, we hugged,
and when I tried to pull away, you<br/>kept your hand on my neck.
Only because your hand<br/>was still around my waist.
Oh, come on! You leaned into it.
- I... leaned into it?<br/>- Yeah.
You're like the crappy kid in Little League<br/>who knows he's not going to make contact,
so he just...
"Oops, I got hit by the<br/>pitch. Better take my base.
Oh, that was you in Little League, wasn't it?
My on-base percentage was off the charts!
Oh, no! The slap-petizers.
You know what? That's it!
This is Thanksgiving.
Solve this right now.
And if you have sex<br/>again, neither of you gets dessert!
Oh, what the hell kind of<br/>Thanksgiving is this anyway?
Um, most Thanksgivings.
Don't stress, baby.
I'll try to find us something relaxing.
Thanks, baby.
Ooh, some classical music, maybe.
Oh, my! Look at that.
That means we're in the<br/>final hour of the countdown.
I'm not scared.
Then why is your right cheek twitching?
It's not...
Maybe it's because Future<br/>Me slaps Future You so hard,
it reverberates back to the<br/>present, shattering the time-slap continuum.
Please don't slap me.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, God! Don't slap me again!
I don't want to get slapped again, and the<br/>first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it!
I don't like it one bit!
I thought I ruined it by<br/>putting a clock on it, Barney?
Well, you didn't ruin it;<br/>you made it so much worse!
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I've lost ten pounds;<br/>my suits are wearing me.
You know what? I'm outta here.
Well, no, no, no. You can't leave.
Why can't I?
Nowhere in the rules does it say that I<br/>have to sit through sort of mental torture!
You are allowed to slap my face, sir,
but you are not allowed<br/>to slap my mind! Good day!
- But it's Slapsgiving.<br/>- No!
It's Thanksgiving!
Our first one as a married<br/>couple, as grownups...
and you're not even trying to be a part of it!
None of you are!
So...
as Slap Bet Commissioner,I'm<br/>issuing a ruling.
Thanksgiving is a day of peace.
There will be no slaps today!
- What?<br/>- Yes!
In your face!
Not my face... your face!
What's up, dudes?
Hey, Bob.
- Baby, please...<br/>- No!
The Slap Bet Commissioner's word is final,
so get in the kitchen and<br/>mash some potatoes, now.
And for the rest of the day, we are going<br/>to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.
Not too grownup.
I made Jell-O shots.
We's gonna get silly, bitches.
Look at us!
We can't be alone together, can we?
Apparently not.
What does that mean?
We're supposed to be friends.
Well... We aren't friends, are we?
Not really. We avoid each other.
We smile politely.
We're two people who pretend to be friends<br/>because it would be inconvenient not to.
Well, maybe we should stop pretending.
Maybe we should.
So...
Oh, what do we do now?
I suppose... we eat dinner.
Yeah.
And then that's it.
Okay.
Happy Thanksgiving.
So we sat down to our first<br/>Thanksgiving together as a group...
and, apparently, our last.
Marshall, you're not eating.
Did something spoil your slap-petite?
No, I just thought...
before we eat, maybe the chef<br/>would like to say a few words.
Nope. This sucks.Eat up and leave.
Well, then,I'd like to say something.
If that's cool?
today, Lily did something great.
Not only did she gather us all here<br/>together and cook a delicious meal,
but she also started a new tradition.
We're gonna do this again next<br/>year, and the year after that...
maybe for the rest of our lives.
I think that's pretty<br/>amazing if you think about it.
And it's all thanks to you, Lily.
I love you.
So, to the first of many<br/>Thanksgivings together.
This is rad!
A nice, small, simple Thanksgiving.
I'm the youngest of ten in my<br/>family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess.
All the yelling and the screaming...
And then a funny thing happened...
It's really a major buzz-kill.
- Major Buzz-kill.<br/>- Major Buzz-kill.
Oh, no...
I thought we were done with that?
I guess we're not.
Guess we're not.
You see kids, friendship<br/>is an involuntary reflex...
it just happens, you can't help it.
That first Thanksgiving turned<br/>out to be a wonderful...
dinner with the four people<br/>I love most in the world...
and Bob.
And it did become a tradition.
That's why every year, we go to Aunt Lily<br/>and Uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.
Hey, check it out!
We're in the last 20 seconds of<br/>Marshall's countdown to nothing.
Barney, put it away.
How does it feel, Marshall, to<br/>sit there, impotently...
your large, flaccid hand, just<br/>dangling in the wind?
The slap will occur in ten...
Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!
Barney, put it away.
I will in... five...
four...
You can slap him.
What?
Wait, you...
That's three!
Thanks, baby, you're the best.
And as a special, added bonus, I've<br/>composed a song just for this occasion.
Ted, lights!
* What is this feelin' *
* That's put you in your place? *
* A hot, red burnin' on the side of your face *
* You feel the blood rush to your cheek *
* Tears start to fill your eyes *
* And your lips are tremblin' *
* But you can't speak, you're tryin' *
* Oh, you're tryin' *
* Not to cry! *
* Ya just got sla-apped *
* Across the face, my friend *
* You just got slapped *
* Yes, that really * * Just happened *
* Everybody saw it *
* And everybody laughed and clapped *
* It was awesome *
* Wait, you just got... *
* Slapped. *
Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.
well guys have fun
well this is gonna be a major clean-up
major clean-up
Oh, man we're gonna be doing<br/>this all the time now, aren't we?
that's the general idea
general idea
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ted: Kids, back in 2007, it<br/>seemed like everyone belonged
To these silly things<br/>called gyms.
The idea was you'd pay<br/>them lots of money
To run around<br/>and lift heavy things.
Biggest rip-off in the world.
And yet people fell for it.
Including me.
Oh, forgot my wallet.
It started with one<br/>of those moments
When you realize<br/>you're not as in shape
As you want to be.
(panting):<br/>Whoo...
That's further than it looks.
Aw, coupon's on my dresser.
That's too far.<br/>Forget it.
Please don't judge me.
I wound up shame-eating<br/>the whole pizza.
I woke up all greasy and sweaty.
My sheets looked like what they<br/>wrap deli sandwiches in.
Maybe I should join a gym.
Do you go to a gym?
Well, I go to total rip fitness,<br/>but I don't work out there.
What do you do?
I invest.
There goes one<br/>of my investments now.
Cheryl, hard work's paying off.
Keep up the good work.
So your investments are women?
Yes.
Women who, how shall<br/>I put this delicately?
They fat.
So, I come here,
Give them lots of attention now.
Then when they get hot, who's<br/>the first guy they run to?
The one who invested in them<br/>when they weren't.
Wow, I can't decide if<br/>I'm thoroughly disgusted
Or really, really impressed.
Of course, not all<br/>investments pay dividends.
See the girl over there at the<br/>vending machine... tonya.
She is one kit kat away<br/>from junk bond status.
Hey, barney.
Becky, elliptical machine's
Really working for you.<br/>Nice stuff.
That one's going to reward<br/>shareholders soon.
I foresee aggressive<br/>growth in my future.
What up?
Wow, that makes me<br/>want to join a gym.
So I can get super strong
And punch you really hard<br/>in the face.
Yes, we should all do it.
Yeah, let's all punch<br/>barney in the face.
No, I'm serious.
We should totally join a gym.
Come on, we put on
The beer weight together...
Might as well<br/>take it off together.
Or we could just<br/>stop drinking beer.
No. I say we join a gym.
Are you marshall?<br/>Yeah.
Hi, I'm trish.
I'm the trainer<br/>you signed up for.
Oh, hi.
Really great
To meet you, trish.
It's a pleasure.
Marshall, can I talk<br/>to you for a second?
Sure.<br/>Great.
Just a second.
Yeah, sweetie, I think
She maybe just a little<br/>too hot to be your trainer.
I get it.
I mean, I see what<br/>you're worried about.
But this is just about me<br/>taking care of myself.
You'll always be my sugar.
So, marshall, are you ready
To make a commitment<br/>to your body?
Pssh! Please, I'm all about<br/>committing to my body.
I'll drive to vermont and<br/>have a commitment ceremony
To my body if you want.
That was a weird thing to say.
All right.<br/>Start with 100 push-ups.
All right, cool. How many<br/>do you want me to do? 100.
Oh, I thought that was a figure<br/>of speech... 100 push-ups,
Like do a bazillion push-ups.
No one can do 100.
Do you smell that?
No.
It smells like there's<br/>a little bitch in my gym.
Are you being a little bitch<br/>in my gym?
No.
Then get on the floor<br/>and give me 100!
You don't have to yell at me.
I love it here.
It's just normal women<br/>who want to get in shape.
I don't have to put on makeup,<br/>do my hair,
Wear some trendy outfit.
Yeah, this place is great.
We're meeting our friend<br/>robin here.
I hope you don't hate her.<br/>She's pretty hot.
Shut up.
Lily, tell him to shut up.
I'm sorry, lesbian prison guard,<br/>do we know each other?
Ted, lily, you'll never believe<br/>what just happened.
Oh, hey, dude, I'm barney.
So I was at the smoothie bar...
What can I get you?
Oh, my god! Rhonda?
It's barney.
Barney stinson from<br/>staten island boulevard.
Hey, barney stinson from<br/>staten island boulevard.
What can I get you?
I can't believe<br/>she didn't remember me.
Why? Who is she?
That's rhonda.
I lost my virginity to her.
Aw, baby, are you still sore?
Trish made me do<br/>70 push-ups,
But she only gave me<br/>credit for ten.
The she had me do<br/>100 sit-ups
And then she made me cry,<br/>using only her words.
It just doesn't add up.
How could rhonda<br/>not remember me?
Well, maybe it wasn't<br/>that good for her.
I mean, it was your first time.
Ted, it's me.
I rocked her world.
You don't believe me?<br/>Okay, story time.
The year was 1998.
I'd been going out with shannon<br/>since freshman year of college.
We were saving ourselves.
So, when we broke up,
There I was,<br/>23 and still a virgin.
I knew nothing about girls.
So I went to the guy
Who knew everything about<br/>girls... my brother james.
Wait, your gay brother james?
Yeah, this was before<br/>he was gay.
(sportscast playing on tv)
(sobbing)
(blubbering)
Barney...
Barney, you need to find a girl
And have sex with her asap.
That is what dudes<br/>do after a breakup.
I know. I want to, but...<br/>I guess I'm just scared.
Of course you're scared.
It's gross.
The thought of doing<br/>that with a woman...
But it's part of being a guy.
Try thinking about baseball.
Somehow I imagine<br/>those players on the field
And it's over a lot faster.
But I don't know the first thing<br/>about seducing a woman.
What do you...? How do you...?
Where do you...?
Stop. Don't overthink it.
You don't want to get the yips.
The yips?
Yeah, when you overthink<br/>simple things so much
That you can't do them at all.
The yips.
Yeah, it happens to<br/>athletes all the time.
Like the second baseman who<br/>suddenly can't throw to first
Or the figure skater who does<br/>a perfect triple toe loop
And then loses it<br/>on the arabesque.
I've actually really<br/>been getting into
Figure skating lately.
But, james...
What woman's gonna want<br/>to have sex with me?
It's not like<br/>I'm a backstreet boy.
The man maker.
Barney:<br/>Rhonda "man maker" french
Was our mom's friend<br/>from down the street.
Got any kings?
Go fish.
So, patty, know that<br/>new paperboy?
I let him throw one into my<br/>hedges, if you know what I mean.
Did you see that new guy<br/>who cleans my pool?
I let him snake my drain,<br/>if you know what I mean.
You know that chinese food<br/>delivery boy?
I had sex with him.
I don't have a funny way<br/>of saying it yet.
It just happened 20 minutes ago.
Of course.
The man maker.
And it'll be easier too,
'cause she knows me so well.
Hi, barry.
Barney.
Hi, ms. French.
I know we haven't seen<br/>each other for a while,
But if there was any chance...
Oh, boy.
Wow, you just rocked my world.
That was the best sex<br/>I ever had.
Barney:<br/>That was the night I was born.
I rose like a phoenix<br/>from her mentholated bosom
And strode into the world,
Armani-clad
And fully awesome.
(groans):<br/>God, please let me stop!
Yes, great, let's stop.
Let's just kick back and wait<br/>for the massive coronary
You're going to have<br/>a couple years from now
When you're 40.
I'm... I'm 29.
50 more!
Lily:<br/>Hi, sweetie.
I got a trainer, too.
This is max.
We're going to focus<br/>on flexibility.
Yeah, I'm gonna stretch her out.
Great... Wait, what?
50 more, now!
(marshall grunting)
Huh?
(marshall groaning)
Hey...
Okay, well, that's not cool.
You know, rhonda,
Running into you
Really got me thinking<br/>about the old days.
You were quite popular.
I sure got around back then.
And there was one young man<br/>who stood out above the pack.
Freddy chibatoni.
That kid had a tongue<br/>like a gecko.
No, no, I was thinking<br/>about someone else.
Chaz alderman.
Hips like a woman,<br/>but he knew how to use them.
What about me?!
You?
Yes. We slept together.
And you said I was the best<br/>you ever had.
Did I?
Oh, right.
About that...
And tell him that
He's the best you ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
He's just a kid.
No he isn't. He's 23 and he<br/>is really hurting, rhonda.
Please.
Maybe we could make a deal.
What?
I don't know...
Oh... (chuckles)
No, girl, I got a girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hers<br/>is the only vagina for me.
Oh... I love it.
It... It isn't<br/>scary at all.
Well, too bad.
I guess your brother's<br/>going to stay a virgin.
(stammering)
(sighs)
Fine.
Reggie jackson, reggie jackson,
Reggie jackson...
But those compliments<br/>you gave me.
(monotone):<br/>Wow...
You just rocked my world.
That was the best sex<br/>I ever had.
But you said<br/>I rocked your world.
All subsequent
Worlds that I rocked
Were only so rocked because<br/>of the confidence I earned
From said first world rocking.
Sorry, barry.
It's barney.
So I'm doing sit-ups
And she says,<br/>"all right, marshall,"
So I summon all my strength<br/>and I do that set,
And then she says,
"give me another set."
So I'm like, "is this<br/>the last set?"
And she says yes.
So I do that set<br/>and then she says,
"give me another set."
She lied to my face!
Everything hurts.
Baby, the whole point<br/>of working out
Is to feel better.
This trainer is<br/>making you miserable.
You have to call her and quit.
I got to work through it.<br/>I got to finish what I started.
If you're too scared,<br/>I can call her.
Her number's on this card.
Hi. Is this trish?
This is marshall's wife.
Listen, we have a problem<br/>here and it's you.
I don't know who the hell<br/>you think you are,
But from now on, you don't<br/>tell marshall what to do.
You are an employee.
We tell you what to do.
And I'm telling you<br/>you're fired, bitch.
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, bye.
You better get down there, baby.
She's pretty pissed.
Hey, buddy.
Still bummed about<br/>the whole rhonda thing?
No. Why would I let the approval<br/>of one woman define who I am?
That's very mature<br/>of you, barney.
Let him finish.
When I can let the approval
Of a gaggle of supermodels
Define who I am. What? What?
Three tickets to the after party
Of the victoria's secret<br/>fashion show?
Uh, kablammie!
Lily, um, could I go?
Go. You're too sore<br/>to do anything anyway.
Oh... Wow.
Okay, this, boys, is not<br/>a regular season game.
This is the world series.
So remember, we work together.<br/>We're a team.
And if anyone<br/>sees heidi klum... dibs.
Ha-ah! Target acquired.<br/>Dig deep. Mm-hmm!
Ted:<br/>Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey, it's a nice party, huh?
Yeah, it's great.
Do you guys work<br/>for the company?
Yeah, it's called
"I'm gonna get in<br/>your panties, incorporated."
Gross!
Dude!
I don't know.<br/>That was terrible.
I am so sorry.
Wait a minute. It's okay.<br/>It's okay. It's fine.
It's a numbers game.<br/>I'm cool.
Model... Model.
Uh... Hi.
I know, right?
This party is legend.<br/>Wait for it...
Uh, how long do we<br/>have to wait for it?
I think he's having a stroke.
What is the matter with me?<br/>I don't know.
Wait, wait, wait... you don't<br/>think I have the yips, do ya?
No, no, no, relax.
There's alessandra ambrosio.
English is her second language.
Even if you screw up,<br/>she'll never know.
Come on.
Hi.
Hi.
Those are very nice honkers.
Honkers?<br/>I don't know this word.
Do you want to go dance?
I'm talking about those things.
Ah-ooga!
Ah-ooga!
Ew!
Oh, no, I can't have the yips.<br/>I can't have the yips.
Not here. Not now.
This is me.<br/>It's barney, barney!
Heidi klum!
This is perfect. I can do this.<br/>I can do this.
But thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.<br/>Heidi klum, I'm barney.
Hi, barney.<br/>Nice to meet you.
Goobidy, goobidy,<br/>goobidy, goobidy.
Whoa.
Is he okay?
Uh, he has the yips.
Hasn't been able to hit<br/>on a woman all night.
He has the yips?
Ooh, that's bad.
You know, in germany, we call<br/>this (speaks german phrase).
Whoa, that is bad.
I don't know<br/>what's happened to me.
I've, I've totally lost<br/>my confidence.
Aw...
Barney, maybe you have<br/>to open up to somebody.
Maybe you have to<br/>open up to some...
He just found out that the woman<br/>he lost his virginity to
Only did it because<br/>his brother bribed her.
Ooh, that's a rough one.
I mean, the only thing<br/>I can think of
To get rid of<br/>(speaks german phrase)
Is you have to go out there.
And you need to find that woman.
And you need to earn it<br/>with her for real.
That is the only way<br/>how you can find yourself.
I see little hamburgers!
I love little hamburgers.
Auf wiedersehen.
Wow!<br/>Yeah.
I just made out with heidi klum.
What?
Ted, just... Okay?
(knocking)
Come in.
Hi, rhonda.
Hi, kiddo.<br/>Surprised to see you here.
So, hey, uh,<br/>maybe how about sex?
Let's sex.
What are you talking about?<br/>I'm watching wheel of fortune.
You can keep watching.<br/>I'll face you toward the tv.
That's a cute idea, kid.
Great.
No, I'm not having sex with you.
Sit down a minute.
I'm not the man maker anymore.
You know what?
About five years ago,
I realized there was<br/>an emptiness inside of me
That no amount of<br/>meaningless sex could fill.
I needed something more.
And that's when I<br/>discovered indian casinos.
Hey, barney,
It's weird not seeing you<br/>in a suit. What's going on?
Uh, not much.<br/>My entire sexual history
Was built on a rotting<br/>foundation of lies.
My whole identity is lost<br/>in a pit of menthol ashes.
Work is good.
(guy slaps his back,<br/>marshall groans)
I'm never going<br/>back to that gym again.
(groans)
Today at work,<br/>I had to have an intern
Rip up my bagel and put<br/>little pieces in my mouth.
Yeah, I'm done there, too.
That place is horrible.
What about<br/>your big muscular trainer
Who's so into<br/>stretching you out?
Yeah, well, turns out
That guy had no affiliation<br/>with the gym whatsoever.
Come on, guys, don't<br/>give up on the gym.
It's been great for us.
Like today, robin and I<br/>had a really nice moment.
(loud groaning):<br/>Oh, god! Oh... Yahhh!
(grunting)
Robin, hey, I just wanted
To come over and thank you.
Thank me for what?
Well, you know how it's hard<br/>for exes to be friends
Because there's this lingering<br/>sexual tension between them?
Gone. Thank you.
(laughs)
You know, for all the crap<br/>you've given me,
I haven't seen you<br/>work up a sweat there once.
It's not true.<br/>I was there today.
Yeah, but didn't you<br/>leave early?
(music playing in headphones)
(music stops)
Oh, great.
Now I got to go home<br/>and charge this.
Wait a minute.
You didn't work out<br/>Tuesday either.
Brought the wrong shorts.
Yeah, and you totally<br/>disappeared on Monday, too.
No, I was at the<br/>gym the whole time.
Ooh! Oh, I love this gym.
Lily, help me bend down<br/>these three fingers.
Actually, I have an idea.
Do it! Come on! Do it, you<br/>worthless piece of crap!
Please! Please, I just want<br/>to go home.
Come on.<br/>This is your last set!
(sobbing):<br/>You said that last time!
Gone.
Hey.
Rhonda.
I saw your friend<br/>ted at the gym.
After he puked and cleared the<br/>line at the smoothie bar,
He said you were kinda<br/>having a tough time.
Did you change your mind<br/>about having love, making sex,
Penis vagina?
What is the matter with me?
Oh, honey...
I just, I don't get it.
You slept with so many guys.
You slept with my brother.
We are practically<br/>the same person.
Was I really so bad?
Nobody's good the first time.
But I was.<br/>At least I thought I was.
Oh, barney, you know...<br/>Sex isn't everything.
When is the last time<br/>you had a conversation
With a woman with no intention<br/>of scoring with her?
I sat next to former<br/>secretary of state
Madeleine albright<br/>at a benefit once.
I certainly didn't intend<br/>to hit that.
Yeah, well, I tell you what.
Sleeping with me again isn't<br/>gonna solve anything.
I don't know what else is.
I think I know.
Do you have any kings?
No, go fish.
See, barney, isn't it nice<br/>to just sit
And have a evening with a woman,<br/>no agenda?
Just make nice conversation?
No.
Yeah, kinda sucks, doesn't it?
Oh, my god, barney, you really<br/>did just rock my world.
That was amazing.
And I'm not lying.
I know you're not lying, baby.
And it was good for you?
It was the best sex<br/>I've ever had.
(yawns) later.
Daddy's back.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
Hey. Pretty good.
Pretty good. Ooh!
I can move my legs now and I<br/>can lift my arms this high.
Oh!<br/>Oh!
Yeah, you know, I feel<br/>like I have more energy.
Yeah, it was hard at first,<br/>but now if I go a day
Without working out, I miss it.
I'm proud of us, guys.
The first week is the hardest.
We're over the hump.
Joining that gym was the<br/>best decision we ever made.
And we never went back<br/>to the gym again.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Oh, my god!
I have a tattoo.
Oh, that's not a tattoo.
That, dear boy,<br/>is a tramp stamp.
A tramp stamp.
Ted:<br/>Kids, too often in life,
We make decisions that we're<br/>not prepared to live with.
This is a story<br/>about those decisions,
And the consequences<br/>that follow.
Say good-bye, kids,
'cause it won't be around<br/>much longer.
Oh, but, ted, if you get rid<br/>of the butterfly,
How's everyone gonna know
You're a stripper from reno<br/>with daddy issues?
(laughing)
Yes, yes, enjoy these
Final moments of mockery
Because in just ten surprisingly<br/>expensive sessions,
Stella is gonna zap<br/>that butterfly
Right off the face<br/>of my lower back.
Stella?<br/>Dr. Stella zinman.
She's the best in the business.
And she's rather cute.
In fact... We're going<br/>to a movie together tonight.
What?
I asked her out.
Oy. Oh. Ted, why<br/>would you do that?
What's the matter with you?<br/>What?
What do you mean?<br/>Dude...
Don't poop where you eat.
Oh, no, this doesn't count.
If it's someone you see<br/>on a regular basis,
And you can't avoid them...
And in this case,<br/>you're paying them...
Then yes, it counts.
Ted,
You've heard<br/>of the golden rule, right?
"Love thy neighbor?"
Uh, actually,<br/>it's "do unto others"
As you would have them<br/>do unto you."
It's from the bible.
Damn it, ted, I've worked out<br/>this whole thing
Where the golden rule is<br/>"love thy neighbor,"
So just... Okay?
Now, the golden rule is<br/>"love thy neighbor."
But there's one rule above it:
The platinum rule:<br/>Mmm.
"Never ever, ever, ever,<br/>love thy neighbor."
Well, that's cute.
But she's not my neighbor;<br/>she's my doctor.
So if you'll excuse me...<br/>Wait, ted,
Barney has a point.
Remember what happened
With me and curt<br/>down at the station?
Oh, yeah, and remember<br/>what happened with us
And the gerards across the hall?
Need I remind you
About me and wendy the waitress?
Yeah, I don't have time<br/>for this.
I'm out the door as soon<br/>as I'm finished with my hair.
Good, then we've got<br/>a solid half hour.
(all laugh)
And in that time,
We will convince you
Not to set foot out that door.
It's a story older<br/>than time, my friend,
And it always plays out<br/>in the same eight steps.
Step 1: Attraction.
No, that's not possible.<br/>It's true.
That's not even possible.
12 of them.<br/>There's no way.
Hi, barney.<br/>Hey.
Here's your gin and tonic.<br/>Thanks.
Oh, gosh.
Look at that.
Oh, hi!
Hi. You must be our<br/>new neighbors.
I'm michael.<br/>And I'm laura.
Oh, hi, welcome<br/>to the building. Yeah.
Do you guys know any good<br/>brunch places around here?
We love brunch!
You must be robin.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Curt "the iron man" irons.
I'm gonna be doing sports.
Oh. Welcome.
You look really familiar.
Are you a former athlete?
Hockey.
The attraction is
Instant and undeniable.
But you know better.
You've seen your friends<br/>make the same mistakes
Before.
You've laughed smugly at them.
(chuckling):<br/>Idiots.
But still, you think,<br/>"this is different.
The platinum rule<br/>doesn't apply to me."
And that's step 2.
Bargaining.
I think I've got
A little crush on our sports guy.<br/>No.
No, don't do it. No, no, no, no.
I know, I know.
But he used to play hockey,<br/>and I'm a canadian.
I can't help it.
If he were missing some teeth,
I probably<br/>would've already hit that.
Robin, it's a mistake.
Remember what happened<br/>with me and marshall?
The gerards across the hall?
Michael and laura.
They're awesome!
We're gonna invite them<br/>over for dinner.
No! No! Really? Are you insane?
Guys, guys, guys,
This is new york city.
You don't get close<br/>to the neighbors.
You nod at them politely<br/>in the hall.
You call the cops if you<br/>haven't seen them in a while
And you smell something<br/>funny, and that is it.
We're not gonna date them.
We're just gonna be<br/>friends with them.
That's the couples<br/>version of dating.
And you've got the couples<br/>version of the hots for them.
Oh, yeah,
You want to eat brunch<br/>with them.
You want to browse<br/>at pottery barn with them.
You want to go antiquing<br/>with them, don't you?
Oh, yeah,
You want to antique<br/>the crap out of them.
Need I remind you
What happened with me<br/>and wendy the waitress?
I've decided to seduce<br/>wendy the waitress.
No!
Don't do it!<br/>Request denied!
What rule is there
That says I can't seduce the<br/>waitress at my favorite bar?
I don't know. I'd expect you<br/>to have one already.
Yeah, with some sort<br/>of catchy name.
Well, I don't.
I don't have one<br/>and I never will
Because it's a great idea.
Come on, guys.
She's gullible.<br/>I'm bored.
We're perfect for each other.
Ted:<br/>Barney.
We love this bar.
If you screw over<br/>wendy the waitress,
You're going to kill the bar.
Bar-killer. Don't<br/>kill the bar, dude.
Yeah, well...<br/>I think it'll be okay.
And it was a huge mistake.
Yeah, well, I think<br/>it'll be okay.
And it was a huge mistake.
Yeah, well...<br/>I think it'll be okay.
And it was a huge mistake.
Yeah, well...<br/>I think it'll be okay.
Ted, trust me.
You don't want to do this.
Look, stella and I<br/>are both adults.
We're both smart, mature people
Capable of making<br/>good decisions.
You have a butterfly<br/>tramp stamp.
We're just seeing a movie.
If it seems at all weird,<br/>I'll back off.
That's what everyone thinks.
And then along comes step 3:
Submission.
Night.
Hey, barney.
Carl had to take off.<br/>You mind giving me a hand?
Not at all.
Robin.<br/>Mmm?
I got two tickets<br/>to the rangers.
Center ice.
Want to go?
And then we discover the movers<br/>lost all our kitchen boxes.
We don't have<br/>a single pot or pan.
Guess we're ordering<br/>take-out.
Want to have dinner<br/>with us tonight?
♪
♪
I love them.<br/>Me, too.
(sighs)
Wow.
That was an interesting use<br/>of the beverage gun.
Club soda can get anything off.
(sighs)
It finally happened.
All this time,
Every drink I brought you...
I always felt there was this<br/>unspoken connection between us.
And I was right.
Hey, can I get a gin and tonic?
See, I bet you didn't pay<br/>for that gin and tonic.
Oh, I paid for it.
But you got to admit,<br/>there is an upside
To breaking the platinum rule.
Like maybe, as her boyfriend,
I could get a discount<br/>on treatments.
Oh, ted.
Of course there's an upside.
At first.
That's step 4.
Perks.
We can split a cab<br/>to work together.
We always have<br/>a standing lunch date.
And last night,<br/>at the hockey game,
Curt got us into<br/>the locker room,
And I met mason raymond.
Left wing for the<br/>vancouver canucks.
What's the opposite<br/>of name-dropping?
Damn it, you guys.
Be psyched.
Yes, we see each<br/>other every day,
But I think it's<br/>going really well.
That's what we thought.
And it's so convenient.
They're right across the hall.
Say it's Sunday,
And we want to have a brunch<br/>double date with someone?
We just go across the hall.
And say we want to<br/>have a dinner party
Exploring the wine and cuisine
Of France's loire valley?
We just go across the hall.
Say we want to play<br/>a game of charades...
You just go across the hall?
Come on, people.<br/>Get excited for us.
We've got a great thing<br/>going here.
That's what I thought.
Dude, you got to flick it.<br/>You don't...
Hi, sweetie.
I had the kitchen whip<br/>these up, no charge.
Okay.
Bye.
I mean, not bye.<br/>I'm not leaving.
I'll be over there.
Okay.
Come on, guys.<br/>Free nachos.
What?
We like this bar.
Don't kill the bar, dude.
Nay, we love this bar.<br/>Don't kill the bar, dude.
This bar is like home to us.
Don't kill the bar, dude.<br/>You're killing the bar.
I am not killing the bar.
Wendy the waitress
Has seen how I operate<br/>in this place.
It is perfectly clear
To everyone involved
That this is nothing more<br/>than a temporary fling.
It's fine.
But it wasn't.
It's fine.
But it wasn't.
It's fine.
But it wasn't.
Which brings us to step 5:
But he should be back<br/>on the mound
By spring training.
And that's sports.
Back to you, robin.
Thanks, iron man.
We'll be right back.
Man:<br/>And clear.
So you want to do<br/>something later?
Oh, so you're talking to me now?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about last night.
You said you'd call<br/>and you didn't.
I missed you and I waited up,<br/>but you didn't call.
That really hurt.
Oh.
Um, I'm sorry,<br/>I-I guess I just forgot.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I don't want to fight tonight.
It's our first weekiversary.
On my suggestion, you flip it.
Why would you flip it?<br/>It doesn't...
Hey, wendy, uh, do me a favor
And send a glass of champagne
To that pretty young thing<br/>over there.
What?
Over there.
You.
You're the pretty young thing...
Is what I meant.
Champagne? Would you? On me.
Oh. Okay.
Thanks, sweetie.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, neighbors.
We bought all the fixings<br/>for a mexican fiesta.
Oh.
Um, well, we actually<br/>have tickets...
And no fiesta would<br/>be complete without...
Dude, actually,<br/>we made other plans, so...
Okay. One word.
Two syllables.<br/>Sounds like...
"parade."<br/>charades.
Charades.
What do you say?
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Which brings us to step 6.
Yeah, listen, I'm leaving.
So if you want to write<br/>the rest of these down,
I will read it tomorrow.
Don't do this, ted.
You want to get out of the way?
Don't do this, ted.<br/>All right.
Don't.
Dude! Gah!
It was perfect!
You're such a jerk.
Which brings us to step 6.
You finally realize<br/>you've made a huge mistake
And now you have to live<br/>with it.
Step 6 is called purg...<br/>Wait for it.
Keep waiting...
Keep waiting for all of eternity
Only to discover<br/>there's no escape... atory.
God, I'm such
An idiot.
Yeah.
Curt "the iron man" irons
Keeps leaving me<br/>love notes on post-its.
On the teleprompter, on my desk,
On the coffee-maker,
On the jar of sugar packets<br/>next to the coffee-maker.
"Here's some sugar<br/>for my sugar."
The iron man.
(sighing)
I remember that.
God, we are such idiots.
Yup.
Every time we step out the door,
They're out there<br/>waiting for us.
Sometimes, we'll send ted out<br/>first as a scout.
Nobody's there.
Then we'll go out one second<br/>later, and there they are.
It's freakin' supernatural.
Are they ghosts?<br/>Can only we see them?
"Hey, neighbor." "hey,<br/>neighbor." "hey, neighbor."
(sighs)
Hmm, I remember that.
How could you guys let me date<br/>wendy the waitress?
Oh, you are kidding me.<br/>What?!
Don't kill the bar, dude.<br/>We said, "don't do it."
My own bar.
I can't hit on women<br/>in my own bar.
Remember the old barney?
He was a lion,<br/>the king of the jungle,
Stalking whatever prey he chose,
Going in for the kill.
You've got a whole<br/>meat locker at home
Full of corpses, don't you?
Now look at me.
Declawed. Neutered.
What was once
My jungle is now my zoo.
And I am forced to mate<br/>with the same old lioness
Again and again and again,
While families pay to watch.
Yeah, this metaphor's really<br/>falling apart.
Put a bell around my neck<br/>and scratch my belly, kids,
For I am just<br/>a docile housecat now.
Meow.
Well, we love this bar.
You can't dump her.
Marry her if you have to.
Wendy<br/>the waitress-hyphen-stinson.
Don't kill the bar, dude.
And so, inevitably,<br/>you have to do the thing
You've been dreading all along.
Now, a relationship-ectomy
Is a delicate surgery as it is,
But in the case of<br/>the platinum rule,
It takes a very, very<br/>steady hand, and that's...
Step 7: Confrontation.
Curt, we need to talk.
I like you...
Guys, we like you a lot...
I don't like you.
We're pretending this works,<br/>but it doesn't.
And I'm getting a little<br/>sick of the whole charade.
We're getting<br/>a little sick of charades.
I mean, I don't like you<br/>that way.
I used to like you that way.
But now that<br/>I've seen everything
There is to see, I don't know,
I kind of want<br/>to see those same parts
Just... On other girls.
So maybe, we could go back<br/>to just being coworkers.
Maybe we should just go<br/>back to being neighbors.
Other girls and you,
If you're into that.
But the other girls<br/>have to be there, too.
That's the important part.
Gosh, you're just terrified
Of ever getting close to anyone,<br/>aren't you?
Or that.
Let's say it's that.
So can I get a gin and tonic?
And in any other relationship,
That would be it.
End of story.
But because you have<br/>to see this person again,
There's a step 8: Fallout.
Robin:<br/>And now, here's
Curt "the iron man" irons<br/>with sports.
Curt?
Curt?
Well, the knicks lost.
It's sad, really.
They had a real shot.
Then, out of nowhere, game over.
And why?
Why, robin?
Uh, well, their<br/>perimeter shooting
Has been a little<br/>bit off this season...
The knicks lost because they<br/>were afraid of getting hurt.
So they didn't even try.
Well, you know what I think?
I think
The knicks didn't deserve<br/>my love to begin with.
The knicks suck.
(sobbing)
And that's sports.
Lily:<br/>Do you see anything?
Marshall:<br/>I think we're clear.
Okay, go, go, go!
(hushed):<br/>That was close.
(hushed):<br/>Too close.
(knocking)
You've got to be kidding me.
What do we do?
I have no idea.
(knocking continues)
Ted:<br/>Guys, are you there?
I forgot my keys.<br/>Can you open up?
It's just ted.
Wait!
Hello?<br/>(knocking)
Guys?
(mouthing words)
Baby, we only have one choice.
Okay, hurry! Michael<br/>and laura are probably...
(lily screams)
Hey, neighbors.
Yeah.<br/>(barney chuckles)
Barney, I just want you to know,<br/>I have no hard feelings.
It wasn't the best idea
For us to get involved.
I hope we can still be friends.
Thanks, wendy.
Of course we can.
If you need anything else,<br/>let me know.
Wow.
I've got to hand it<br/>to wendy the waitress:
That was very mature of her.
She's gonna try to kill me.
This is poisoned.
What? You're being ridiculous.
Yours is poisoned, too.
She's trying to kill me<br/>and everyone close to me.
What are you talking about?<br/>Ted!
Look at the facts: I dump her
And she says,<br/>"no hard feelings."
She's a psycho!
What other explanation is there?
Uh, that you're letting yourself<br/>believe she's crazy
So you don't have to face<br/>the far more likely possibility
That she doesn't want<br/>to date you either?
Where did marshall<br/>get that hamburger?
I don't know, I guess
Wendy the waitress<br/>brought it to him.
Nooooooo!
Dude.
You're welcome.
Wait a second.
You've been sitting here,
Pretending to be<br/>the expert on all this,
But the truth is,<br/>there was no real fallout
From your breakup at all?
Yet.
You're an idiot.
All right, I'm taking off.
What?!<br/>I have a date.
Wha...? You are such a jerk!
Ted, have you not<br/>been listening?
Attraction,<br/>bargaining, submission,
Perks, tipping point,
Purgatory,<br/>confrontation, fallout!
These things will<br/>all happen to you
As surely as they happened<br/>to all of us!
It's a rule of nature!
Well, I'm sick of all the rules!
There's too many of them!
The hot/crazy scale,<br/>the lemon law,
The platinum rule...
If everyone in the world
Followed every one<br/>of your rules,
The human race<br/>would cease to exist.
Yes, chances are<br/>stella and I are not
Going to live<br/>happily ever after.
The overwhelming odds<br/>have it ending badly.
And when that happens,
It'll be for one<br/>of a million possible reasons.
But that doesn't mean<br/>I'm not gonna try.
And when it does fail,
So help me god, it's not gonna<br/>be because of some rule.
P.S.
You just made my hair<br/>look awesome.
Good night.
♪
So stella and I went<br/>on our date.
But here's the funny thing:
Turns out,<br/>it wasn't actually a date.
So what do you mean<br/>"it wasn't a date"?
She thought we were seeing<br/>a movie just as friends.
Why would she think that?
Did she see your tattoo<br/>and assume you were gay?
Apparently, there's a rule<br/>that says I can't date stella.
Exactly: The platinum rule.
Stella reads my blog.
No, this rule comes from the<br/>american medical association.
Doctors aren't legally allowed<br/>to date their patients.
Oh, sorry, ted.
Eh, it's okay.
What are you guys watching?
So that was the end of the story
Between me and stella,<br/>at least for the time being.
But I don't know, looking back<br/>on the platinum rule,
I think there's a ninth step.
We'll call it coexistence.
It's the moment you realize<br/>that all that anger
And resentment<br/>just isn't useful.
Thanks for watching.
Good night.<br/>♪
And you start to let go of it.
Hey, guys.
So what do you guys<br/>have going on tonight?
We're going to have<br/>a few friends over.
Gonna play some charades.
Have fun.
♪
And move on with your life.
It just takes a while.
On the house.
Thanks.
Cuckoo!

<br/>Just long enough to call you back.

<br/>In a cab, heading downtown with our hot and
<br/>Sexy dates for the evening.
<br/>Yes, it happens that fast!
<br/>You're coming with us.
<br/>For the last time.
<br/>All right,
<br/>I didn't want to tell you this
<br/>in front of marshall and Lilly
<br/>They are old and married and it's too late for them anyway
<br/>but ted, the world is
<br/>Going to come to an end tonight.
<br/>Yes, think about it.

<br/>Yes all right!
<br/>He's in.
<br/>Ted is a great guy.
<br/>You're going to love him.
<br/>So on march 172008, I went
<br/>To a big st. patrick's day party.
<br/>And it's a good thing I did
<br/>Because funny story,
<br/>Your mother was there.
<br/>Hi, have you med ted.
<br/>Hi, I'm mary.
<br/>Hi, happy st. patty's day.
<br/>I haven't met ted either.
<br/>- I'm stefanie. -Hi
<br/>Dude, back off. I called this on stefanie.
<br/>Okay, mary's hot.
<br/>Well then I want mary.
<br/>Fine.
<br/>Oh, I see reverse psychology.
<br/>Then I'm sticking with
<br/>- Stefanie dr. frid. -Ok
<br/>Which one do you want more.
<br/>Either one.
<br/>I want them both.
<br/>You're an idiot.
<br/>It may be a moot point.
<br/>It doesn't look like we're getting in.
<br/>Look at this.
<br/>You know why there's a line,
<br/>it's because i ditched marshall and lilly
<br/>And now the universe is
<br/>Punishing us for it, that's why.
<br/>What's it going to cost us
<br/>To get in, $20?
<br/>$40.
<br/>Dude come on, you're making the we folk look bad.
<br/>just give me your pot of gold.
<br/>Is it just you two?
<br/>Don't worry we're not gonna blow your race here.
<br/>We happen to have two very hot girls with us.
<br/>Mine is the hotter one.
<br/>Sorry guys, if it was
<br/>Just you two, you can go in
<br/>Right now.
<br/>We have nothing but girls in there.
<br/>People will start thinking it's a lesbian bar
<br/>Would you excuse us for just a minute?
<br/>Ted I'm going to be honest
<br/>I was full of it with
<br/>that Nostradamus thing
<br/>but I'm starting to think there's
<br/>Serious planetary crap going on here tonight.
<br/>Never in the history of new
<br/>York city nightclub has
<br/>There been a shortage of dudes.
<br/>Not even during the great
<br/>Dude shortage of 1883.
<br/>We've got to ditch these girls.
<br/>You dragged them all
<br/>The way down here.
<br/>I don't see no ring on this finger.
<br/>Hold on.
<br/>Excuse me.
<br/>Are the girls in there
<br/>Hotter than our dates?
<br/>I don't know if they're hotter
<br/>But they're drunker.
<br/>Rock and roll.
<br/>Welcome to your new dream home my lady.
<br/>All right, all right.
<br/>Put me down, robin thinks we're weird.
<br/>No it's fine,
<br/>it was only weird on the subway.
<br/>I'm going to check the other rooms to see if
<br/>The previous owners left us any free stuff.
<br/>I'll hang our first piece of art,
<br/>There's already a nail,
<br/>hey lily, free nail!
<br/>score!
<br/>- How's that. -perfect.
<br/>Now this is ridiculous
<br/>Is it the nail?
<br/>- Marshall -Is the wall cookt crooked or something?
<br/>- Marshall -Is there a draft in here.
<br/>Marshall,
<br/>what?
<br/>Your apartment is crooked.
<br/>What do you mean?
<br/>It was the kind of thing
<br/>You didn't notice Until you noticed it.
<br/>and once you noticed it, you couldn't not notice it.
<br/>Lilly an marshall's new apartment
<br/>Was crooked.
<br/>Oh, no!
<br/>No, no!
<br/>Oh, no, no! no, no!
<br/>Yes.
<br/>Are you telling me that
<br/>We just spend our entire
<br/>Life saving on a crooked apartment?
<br/>Oh my god
<br/>Oh, she's gonna fret
<br/>Look what I found in the
<br/>Kids' room, free skateboard,
<br/>Score one
<br/>Free hungry, hungry hippo.
<br/>Double score!
<br/>I'm going to check the kitchen
<br/>How can she not notice.
<br/>It's like the last 20 minutes of titanic in here.
<br/>We have keep this quiet,
<br/>If lilly finds out her dream house crooked
<br/>It will break her heart.
<br/>Free salad Strainer.
<br/>I love this place
<br/>Just for tonight, okay?
<br/>Ok
<br/>It's going to be an uphill battle.
<br/>I'm just saying we have to
<br/>Think of the right angle.
<br/>I have a third one but I'm
<br/>Not going to say it.
<br/>I think we've stumbled
<br/>Into some sort of ethical Worm hole.
<br/>- Green suit -yeah
<br/>I ditched marshall and lilly
<br/>And was rewarded with two beautiful girls.
<br/>Suits made of green.
<br/>We bailed on those two beautiful girls
<br/>and now we're
<br/>Being rewarded with a sea of Beautiful girls.
<br/>38 long.
<br/>Like the laws of the
<br/>Universe are working in reverse.
<br/>Can you put it on my tab.
<br/>What's the last name.
<br/>Guido.
<br/>I'm going to try something to see if this works
<br/>- hey -hey what kind of do you get?
<br/>What's your name.
<br/>- Garido. -Dude
<br/>you're right. make it two bottles
<br/>Now we wait and see something good
<br/>Oh, hello
<br/>St. patrick's tradition
<br/>If you're not wearing green,
<br/>You have to get punished.
<br/>well this is what i deserved
<br/>I'm not wearing green either.
<br/>This is deep teal the
<br/>Lighting makes it.
<br/>I'm Ted
<br/>Asheley, with two Es
<br/>please Cs at most.
<br/>You guys can join me and friends.We have a bottle of Tequila
<br/>and shockingly deep belly buttons.
<br/>Okay, it's official, do
<br/>Bad things, good things happen.
<br/>Ted, listen, are you hearing that?
<br/>That's the universe.
<br/>The universe is talking to us.
<br/>We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?
<br/>No the universe is
<br/>Telling us that we have a free pass tonight.
<br/>The universe is saying that
<br/>We don't have to live in
<br/>Fear of the -- are you still there?
<br/>Yeah, I'm still here.
<br/>For the repercussions of our actions.
<br/>There is no waiting for tomorrow
<br/>because do you know why ted?
<br/>There is no tomorrow.
<br/>No tomorrow, huh?
<br/>By the way mr. garido,
<br/>With your champagne you get
<br/>A free complimentary caviar.
<br/>Enjoy.
<br/>Not tomorrow
<br/>Not tomorrow
<br/>Hey wonder what the
<br/>Grown-ups are doing right now?
<br/>I win again!
<br/>Why do I keep winning?
<br/>Maybe your hip spoe just
<br/>Hungrier than ours.
<br/>That's it.That's what is.It's not gravity
<br/>that's for sure. I'll tell you that.
<br/>What's that?
<br/>What's going on here?
<br/>Okay, lilly.
<br/>While you were in the other
<br/>Room, robin and I
<br/>We discovered something about this apartment
<br/>It's not a big deal.
<br/>It's not like a disaster,
<br/>It's just something that
<br/>We're going to have to learn to live with.
<br/>Robin and I saw a ghost.
<br/>What?
<br/>He's kidding, right?
<br/>No, we really saw a ghost.
<br/>What did it look like?
<br/>A sheet with two holes
<br/>He was a Confederate general
<br/>Who was wounded at the battle of Antietam
<br/>and died at the army
<br/>Hospital which once stood on this very spot
<br/>And now he wanders these halls
<br/>vowing revenge against the union he once failed in
<br/>But he seems nice. good guy.
<br/>You see ghosts everywhere.
<br/>You see ghosts at starbucks.
<br/>That kenny g holiday cd
<br/>Just flew off the shelf.
<br/>Last time that happened.
<br/>Robin you're a skeptic so if
<br/>You say you saw a ghost,.
<br/>It passed right
<br/>Through me and suddenly i
<br/>Felt cold.
<br/>So very coal. cold.
<br/>You know ashley, you
<br/>Probably just want to get up
<br/>And walk away but I just
<br/>Have to test out this theory
<br/>I've been working on.
<br/>Tonight, I'm not looking for
<br/>A relationship.
<br/>I really just want to hook
<br/>Up with you, leave before
<br/>Breakfast and never see you again.
<br/>I'm in.
<br/>Unbelievable.
<br/>Hot damn, that's a deep naval!
<br/>No tomorrow ted!
<br/>No tomorrow barney.
<br/>No tomorrow, huh?
<br/>I like that idea.
<br/>Because if there is a tomorrow,
<br/>I'm going to be in
<br/>A lot of trouble.
<br/>Why is that?
<br/>I'm married.
<br/>Tell me you're messing
<br/>With me guys.
<br/>You didn't actually see a ghost
<br/>it's not a big deal baby.
<br/>He seemed friendly.
<br/>You said he's a Confederate general,
<br/>they're the bad guys.
<br/>And he's probably racist!
<br/>He seems polite.
<br/>He has courtly southern manners.
<br/>How can we bring our kids here.
<br/>I don't want a confederate general ghost teach them racism!
<br/>He loves people of all colors and creeds.
<br/>He was fighting for state rights.That's all.
<br/>You have said he was wearing a sheet,
<br/>what do you think that means?
<br/>The apartment is crooked!
<br/>What?
<br/>Robin and i
<br/>Didn't see a ghost.
<br/>The floor is crooked, isn't it?
<br/>Yeah.
<br/>We spent our entire
<br/>Life savings on this particular.
<br/>The next 30 mortgage paying
<br/>Years of our lives will be
<br/>Spent on a floor an it's crooked!
<br/>Thanks a lot, robin.
<br/>How is racist
<br/>Ghost bear than crooked?
<br/>Someone tell me how that's better.
<br/>Oh, I'm sorry.
<br/>That's okay.
<br/>So I'm having second thoughts about that theory.
<br/>I'm telling you if you want to know how old a woman
<br/>Is check her elbows.
<br/>Not that theory.
<br/>You have to be More specific, ted
<br/>Because I have so many theories.
<br/>The whole do bad, good things happen.
<br/>Asheley is married.
<br/>So?
<br/>What do you mean so?
<br/>Open your brain tank,
<br/>Because here come fromPremium 91 octane knowledge.
<br/>There's three rules of cheating.
<br/>It's not cheating if you're not the one whose married.
<br/>It's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels
<br/>And it's not cheating if she's in a different area code.
<br/>You're fine on all three counts.
<br/>How do you know she's from a different area code.
<br/>She's 516
<br/>She may dress like 718, she might act like 212
<br/>But trust me, she is 516
<br/>Oh and her husband
<br/>Letting her out alone on st.Patty's day
<br/>if that guy is not 973, I'm 307.
<br/>Wyoming.
<br/>Maybe we can nail down all our furniture.
<br/>We won't be able to get a pinball machine.
<br/>Unless we put a book under two of the legs or something.
<br/>But if we wanna read those books.this is a nightmare.
<br/>Can't raise our kids here.
<br/>They will grow up slanted.
<br/>If we have a daughter,
<br/>we have to call her ilene.
<br/>I don't think we can live here marshall.
<br/>I don't know what we're gonna to do.
<br/>Marshall?
<br/>Open the door.
<br/>If I make to it the door
<br/>That's five points.
<br/>Woo-hoo!
<br/>Yeah!
<br/>Five points.
<br/>10 bucks says I can do it backwards.
<br/>So lilly and marshall
<br/>Decided to make the best of A bad situation
<br/>and that's also how the apartment roller luge was invented.
<br/>Very careful, very, oh, yeah!
<br/>So she's married.
<br/>Not like she has kid.
<br/>How do you know?
<br/>Wrist! It's like you don't even listen to me.
<br/>Oh, hey.
<br/>Hey.
<br/>Where did you go.
<br/>Well, I just.
<br/>Was it something I said.
<br/>No, no, no, it's just...
<br/>Well, you're married and
<br/>We've been drinking and i was worried we might...
<br/>This is a very bad idea.
<br/>We have a problem
<br/>Hey, hey, hey.
<br/>Is this your husband.
<br/>I've never seen him in my life
<br/>Ok, what's our problem
<br/>Rick, Rick garido
<br/>According to the bar tenor
<br/>I'm the guy who has been
<br/>Buying you shall pain all night
<br/>Ok, there's a very simple explanation
<br/>The next thing I know is the police show up,
<br/>They arrest the other guy
<br/>and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night
<br/>It was awesome
<br/>Awesome?
<br/>Yeah
<br/>You don't see anything wrong with that story
<br/>Well I lost my phone in the club somewhere
<br/>What the hell is wrong with you, dude?
<br/>I lose things
<br/>You kissed a married woman ted
<br/>You committed credit card fraud
<br/>You kissed a married woman
<br/>Do you know how offensive that is to me?
<br/>You're turning into barney
<br/>We don't need another barney
<br/>It's st. patty's day!
<br/>It wasn't as bad as it sounds
<br/>It wasn't as bad as it sounds?
<br/>Huh? okay.
<br/>I want you to hear exactly
<br/>How it sounds ted
<br/>First skipped message
<br/>I don't see no ring on this finger
<br/>And then last night
<br/>Started coming back to me
<br/>The real version
<br/>Are the girls this there hotter than our dates?
<br/>I don't know if they're hotter,
<br/>but they're drunker.
<br/>Rock and roll!

<br/>Next message

<br/>And then you realize
<br/>Next message
<br/>I really want to hook up with you
<br/>Leave before breakfast an
<br/>Never see you again
<br/>Your whole world is off balance
<br/>Next message
<br/>out of whack

<br/>Crooked
<br/>That was hard to listen to
<br/>No one sounds good in answerign machine
<br/>Thanks for doing that
<br/>You yelled at me
<br/>You got very firm with me
<br/>Very confident
<br/>It was cool
<br/>Thanks
<br/>You're very sexy when you yell marshall
<br/>Shut up
<br/>Crazy muscles in your neck
<br/>You're like the kentucky derby, winning streaks
<br/>You're ruining our last moment
<br/>At one point I thought we were going to kiss
<br/>Ted seriously
<br/>I'm married
<br/>A slanted floor
<br/>Architecturally speaking
<br/>Fixing that will be
<br/>Very very
<br/>Very expensive
<br/>And it's going to take some time too
<br/>So, looks like you're stuck with us for a
<br/>Little while longer if
<br/>That's okay
<br/>Are you kidding?
<br/>I love it
<br/>I don't know what's going to happen without you guys around
<br/>Where are you going
<br/>I'm going to get my stupid phone
<br/>So that was st. patrick's day 2008
<br/>I find out years later that your mom was at that party
<br/>I just didn't meet her
<br/>It's a good thing I didn't
<br/>Because if I had, I don't
<br/>Think she would have liked me
<br/>In fact I don't think I like me
<br/>But that's okay
<br/>Tomorrow had arrived
<br/>You see I didn't know it yet,
<br/>But my luck was about to change
<br/>I'm awesome! </div>]

[<div class="full-script">Narrator: Kids, sometimes<br/>in life you see someone,
And you just instantly know
This is the person for you.
It can happen anywhere.
Even the waiting room<br/>of a tattoo removal clinic.
And that's what happened<br/>when I met...
Stella.
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.
My bread and butter.
So I'm guessing that<br/>the real story
Involves a bad breakup<br/>and some booze.
Unless it's a gang tattoo,
In which case, I think it's<br/>time to find a new gang.
No, I just thought<br/>it would be cool
To get a caterpillar tattoo,
And then a few weeks went by,<br/>and all of a sudden...
(laughing)
Well, I can get rid of it<br/>in ten one-hour sessions,
But, I should warn you,<br/>laser surgery's very painful.
Well, I think you'll find
I have a very high<br/>tolerance for pain.
Just last night, I sat through<br/>the worst movie ever made.
Oh, plan 9 from outer space?
No, the worst movie...<br/>Manos: Hands of fate.
Uh, I'm a doctor,<br/>went to medical school.
It's plan 9.<br/>If you don't believe me,
It's playing down<br/>at the pamela theater.
Uh-huh.<br/>I don't believe you, doctor.
Well, what are you<br/>doing tonight?
Hello.
Hey, ted.<br/>Hey.
Hey, put that away.<br/>Tonight's on me.
Oh, no, no, don't...
Come on, I insist.
That's so nice. Thank you.
Hey, guys,<br/>this is my friend ted.
He wants to pay.
Oh, wow. Oh, yay.<br/>Wow, thank you.
One, two, three, four.
Is something wrong?
No, it's just, um...
I'm just a little embarrassed.
I thought this was a date.
But it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.
What's wrong?
Ted's embarrassed... he<br/>thought this was a date.
Ted thought this was a date.
Stella, did you know ted<br/>thought this was a date?
What? I'm not allowed<br/>to date a patient.
It's an ama rule.
She's not allowed<br/>to date patients.
It's an ama rule.
She's not allowed<br/>to date patients.
It's an ama rule.
She's not allowed to date...
Yeah, I got it.
Man:<br/>We all got it.
Ted's a schmuck.
(laughter)
(laughing)
And you bought all the tickets.<br/>Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you were right.
Worst movie-going<br/>experience ever.
Of course, it had nothing<br/>to do with the movie.
I am so sorry that you<br/>thought that was a date.
No, it's fine.
I got to hang out with you<br/>on girls' night out.
All right, so if you're not<br/>allowed to date a patient,
I'll just... I'll wait until<br/>these ten session are up
And then I'll ask you out then.
Well, then, fair warning:
I'm going to say no.
Really? I'm getting mixed<br/>signals from you.
I feel like you've been staring<br/>at my ass for quite some time.
What, you're married?<br/>No.
Boyfriend?<br/>No.
Lesbian?<br/>No.
Only date black guys?<br/>No.
And yet you can say<br/>with absolute confidence
That ten weeks from now,<br/>if I ask you out on a date,
Your answer will be...
No.
No... Hmm.
What could she mean
When she says no?
I don't know,
It is totally cryptic.
This is far from over.
We're talking ten weeks<br/>from now.
Who knows what she'll want then?
I mean, do you know what<br/>you're going to want
For lunch ten weeks from now?
Sloppy joe, shrimp cocktail<br/>and a milk shake.
Ted, do you know how long<br/>it takes a woman
To decide whether or not<br/>she's going to sleep with a guy?
8.3 seconds.
After that,
Her decision is made.
She will not change her mind.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
Describe your first<br/>8.3 seconds with stella.
Lower back butterfly tattoo...
You're up.
(patients laughing)
(all groaning)
So we got off to a rocky start.
That may be a problem<br/>for some guys,
But I get better over time.<br/>Right?
I'm not some top 40 song...
Easily digestible.
I'm complex.
I require time<br/>and multiple listens.
I'm "stairway to heaven."
Wow, roger daltrey just<br/>rolled over in his grave.
That's not the right guy, is it?
He's not even dead, is he?
I think that's great, ted.
You can do whatever<br/>you set your mind to.
In fact, you've inspired me.
I'm going to stop<br/>biting my nails.
But, baby, you love<br/>biting your nails.
I know, but I'm<br/>doing this for ted.
Hmm.
God, this is really hard.
Give me ten sessions,
I'm going to turn that "no"<br/>into a "yes."
Really, ted?<br/>Mm-hmm.
You think so?<br/>Mm.
Well, tell me, how did<br/>the rest of that session go?
This is going to hurt a little.
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.
This one time<br/>I was playing tennis, and...
(high-pitched screaming)
Yeah, but tattoo<br/>removal really hurts.
Everyone probably<br/>sounds like that.
Doctor, are you all right?
I heard a woman<br/>screaming in here.
Oh.
(laughing)
Here's to nine more<br/>great sessions.
(laughter continues)
Narrator:<br/>And so the weeks went by.
The second session I told her<br/>about how I spent a summer
Working with inner-city kids.
The third session we both spoke<br/>nothing but french.
The fourth session<br/>I made her laugh so hard,
She fell out of her chair.
(laughing)
So by the time the fifth<br/>session came around...
Still no.
Still no.
What's up with that?
I mean, I juggled.
You juggled?
I thought you were<br/>trying to impress her.
You do magic.
How is juggling<br/>any lamer than magic?
Magic's not lame.
I don't get it.<br/>I mean...
Is this lame?
(screams) oh, barney, no, no!
We said no fireballs<br/>at the table.
What the hell is wrong with you?
There's alcohol in here.
Barney...<br/>I...
We've talked about this.
It's a fire code violation.
Yeah, but ted provoked me.
No, no, you are<br/>on a time-out.
Go sit over there.
But...<br/>Go!
Anyway... I don't get it.
She should be into me by now.
You know, you can do this, ted.
I said that I would<br/>stop biting my nails,
And kablam-ey.
It's just a challenge.
It can't be easy to woo someone
While you're sticking your<br/>naked butt in their face.
Works for baboons.
It's called "presenting."
I got four sessions left.
Ther-there's got to be<br/>an angle I'm not seeing.
You can't turn a "no"<br/>into a "yes," ted.
Can't be done.
I don't know, barney.
I mean, sometimes<br/>persistence pays off.
I said "yes" eventually.
No, you didn't.
You were like, "no, we<br/>can't, we're friends."
It would mess up the<br/>dynamic of the group."
To ted.
Oh, right.
Wait a second.
Wait a second, I got the angle.
Sir, please don't yell at me,
Because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency<br/>to start crying.
Please don't do it.
Abby, I've told you before.<br/>Please.
When they're rude to you,<br/>hang up the phone.
Man on phone: How difficult<br/>it is for me to... Go on,
You can do this, hang up.
Abby,
Hang it up.
I am too busy<br/>to waste my time...
I'm sorry, I just wish
That some of the patients<br/>would be nicer to you.
The receptionist.
That's my way in.
I like this.
Seduce the receptionist.
That's a great plan.
That's not the plan.
And how would that help me<br/>with stella?
Who?
Here's the plan.
(whistles)
Hi. Here.
I stopped...
Hi, I stopped for coffee
And I... And I thought<br/>I'd grab you something.
Oh, wow, thank you,<br/>that's so nice.
You're like a knight.
I should call you sir ted.
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
(laughing nervously):<br/>It's really stupid.
Um, dr. Zinman, ted's here.
Thanks.<br/>Thanks, abby.
And now we wait.
And sure enough,
By session seven,
She saw me in a whole new light.
Okay, I'm about<br/>to break my big rule here.
Break it.
Okay.
Abby goes bowling
With her church group<br/>every Wednesday night...
Mm-hmm... And she really wanted<br/>to invite you, but she's too shy.
(clicks tongue)
Abby is...?
My receptionist.
You really made<br/>quite an impression on her
With the coffee the other day.
I mean, she has really<br/>not stopped talking about you.
Oh, abby.
I thought you said "alan."
But you just said, "abby is...?"
Right.
Right, I thought I said "alan."
Who's alan?
Who's abby?
My receptionist.
Exactly.
What is happening?
(groaning):<br/>Ted,
You just got to be<br/>yourself, no more gimmicks.
You're right, no more gimmicks.
One more gimmick.
Ted:<br/>You know what's on her shelf?
That self-help book<br/>the power of me.
(all groaning) I know,<br/>I know, but I thought
If I read it, maybe we'd have<br/>something new to talk about.
(all groaning)
It's actually a great book.
It taught me the power<br/>of complete memory.
Can I borrow your copy?
I left it somewhere.
I forget.
Hi.
Ted mosby for dr. Zinman.
Hi, ted.<br/>I'll let her know.
Telepathically?
(laughing):<br/>That's funny.
That's funny, smart, and great.
I am so sorry that I am late.
I have, like, two minutes<br/>for lunch everyday.
It's crazy.<br/>Yeah, I understand.
I was just, uh, checking out<br/>the old bookshelf here.
I see you've read<br/>the power of me.
It's funny...<br/>What? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, I would<br/>never read that piece of crap.
Some patient left it here.
Oh, thank god.
(chuckling):<br/>I couldn't agree more.
That's total crap.
I see people reading that<br/>on the subway
And I just want to shout,<br/>"get a life, people!"
Ted, I found your book.
Your book, the power of me.
I think you accidentally<br/>dropped it in the garbage.
What? No, that's...<br/>That's not mine.
I've never seen that before<br/>in my life.
No, you were reading it<br/>in the lobby.
Wha... no, you have me confused<br/>with someone else.
No, no, look right here.
"From the personal library<br/>of ted mosby."
That's you.
Ted, I hate to say this,
But I think it's "nail<br/>the receptionist" time.
I'm not gonna nail<br/>the receptionist.
Ted, every little boy<br/>wants to grow up
To nail the doctor<br/>or the lawyer.
Somebody's gotta nail<br/>the receptionist.
No. I like stella.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you<br/>right there, ted.
Your little stella<br/>is not so perfect.
What do you mean?
I went down there
And checked her out for myself.
Yeah.
And while I was down there,
I discovered that<br/>she had a secret,
A terrible... Terrible secret.
What?
What is it?
Hold on, I gotta pee.
Okay, I'm back.
What's going on at work?
What's the big secret?!
Oh. Oh, right.
Hi, I'd like<br/>to see dr. Zinman, please.
Sure, what's it regarding?
Oh, I just want to see her.
Want to look at her,<br/>see what she looks like.
I-I don't understand.
I'm sorry, did I accidentally
Oprima numero dos when I called?
Do you speak english?
I want to see her!
Sir, please don't yell at me
Because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency<br/>to start crying.
Barney:<br/>What are your credentials?!
Please don't do that. Please.
I want to know<br/>who am I speaking with!
Barney:<br/>At first she seemed great,
Beautiful, smart,
Way out of your league.
But then I overheard<br/>this conversation.
My grandfather's name...<br/>I was the last-born so...
Oh, abby, did my<br/>hypnotherapist call yet?
No.
(sighs)
When am I going to kick<br/>this folliculaphilia?
(sighs heavily)
Folliculaphilia?
Folliculaphilia.
What is that?
Ted, your perfect woman
Can only be attracted<br/>to men with moustaches.
That is the stupidest thing<br/>I've ever heard.
That's not real.
You're right, ted.<br/>I'm just making that up.
I know that you are<br/>because there's no such thing.
I got it a little bit.
Hi. Uh, ted mosby<br/>for dr. Zinman.
Oh, hi, ted.<br/>Love the 'stache.
You look like a young<br/>tom selleck,
Only a million times handsomer.
Dr. Zinman,<br/>magnum's here to see you.
Just kidding.
Stupid.
Sorry I'm late.<br/>Typical two-minute lunch.
So we are very close<br/>to getting...
(laughing)
(cackling)
Why? Just why?
Y-you don't remember?
I'll bet anyone ten bucks
I can get ted<br/>to grow a moustache.
Uh... Okay.
You sabotaged my next to last<br/>chance with stella
For ten dollars?
I know.<br/>I would've done it for free.
But no. You owe me ten bucks.
This is awful. My-my tenth<br/>session is next week.
I'm gonna ask her out,<br/>and she's gonna say
The most demoralizing syllable<br/>in the english language... no.
You know what?<br/>Just forget it.
I'm not even gonna ask her.
No, you have to.<br/>She likes you.
She said so herself.
I mean...
Oh, my god,<br/>you went and saw her, too.
I swear to you, I did not.
My wife's always getting<br/>on me about my dry elbows.
So good to be in a relationship.
Anyone special in your life?
Or maybe just someone<br/>you're interested in?
Interes-ted in?
You know, we should really<br/>get this mole checked out.
It's just a little irregular.
Marshall:<br/>Irregular? Oh, my god.
This is it. It's all over.
One of my patients has this
Little butterfly tattoo<br/>at the bottom of his back.
Can you stop talking about<br/>your other patients?!
I'm dying here, woman!
There you go. Look,<br/>even if it is something,
It's easily treatable,<br/>so try to relax.
Okay.
Hey, what was it<br/>you were saying before
About the guy<br/>with the butterfly tattoo?
Oh, that... That's nothing.
It's just a little crush.
So I will be calling<br/>you with your results.
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, sir, your book!
No.
Yes.
She said "crush"?
And she was talking about me?
Narrator: That last session<br/>was the least painful of all.
I savored every searing blast<br/>of that laser.
The moment I'd waited<br/>ten weeks for had arrived.
Stella...
Now that I'm<br/>no longer your patient,
Would you like<br/>to have dinner with me?
Ted, you're a really nice guy...
Oh, no.
It has been so great<br/>getting to know you.
I am gonna kill marshall.
I've had so much fun<br/>these past ten weeks.
Oh, my god, this is worse<br/>than the laser.
I have a daughter.
What?
Her name's lucy.<br/>She's eight.
Work and being with her,<br/>that's pretty much my life.
My social calendar
Is movie night with the girls<br/>once a month
When I can get a sitter.
I mean, I've been to one party<br/>in the past year...
St. Patty's day...<br/>It was awful, I left early.
But, really, my only free time
Is the two minutes<br/>I get for lunch, so...
This is why I don't date.
Ted, I only have time
For one most important person<br/>in my life, and that's lucy.
Anyway, it's been fun.
Next time, think before you ink.
But if you ever do<br/>wake up with, like,
A dolphin tattoo on your ankle,<br/>just give me a call.
There it is...
She's a mom.
It's just not gonna happen.
Sorry, dude.
Have a shrimp.
I'm good.
I guess I got no one<br/>but myself to blame.
She told me right from the start
She was gonna say no<br/>and sure enough...
Wait a minute.
Hi.<br/>Hi.
You didn't actually say no.
What do you mean?
All this time you were, uh,<br/>you were supposed to say no,
But you didn't...<br/>I checked the transcript.
(laughs)
So, here's what I'm proposing.
Uh... You only have<br/>two minutes, right?
Right.
Okay. You want to, uh...
Go on a a two-minute date<br/>with me?
Last two-minute date I<br/>had gave me a daughter.
But, um... Okay.
Great.
And... Go.

Ah! That's a good year.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
I just wish that I could get<br/>her to quit smoking, you know?
What?<br/>I'm kidding.
Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?<br/>(sighs)
You know, this neighborhood<br/>just keeps on changing.
This used to be a cute,<br/>little italian restaurant.
I know. New york.
It's a living organism,<br/>an ever-changing tapestry.
Ooh, look at the time.
Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.
Flowers?
I'm allergic.
Okay. See? We're getting<br/>to know each other.
Stella, I had a lovely...
Doggy bag?<br/>Oh.
Stella, I had a lovely time.
Me, too, ted.
And... Date.
(chuckles) huh?
That wasn't so bad, right?
No lengthy, awkward silences.
Dessert ran a little long, so...
I had to cut the<br/>good-night kiss.
I think I can be late just once.
Ted...
Look, I would love<br/>to have a second date, I would.
But I understand that you really<br/>don't have time right now,
But if you ever do,<br/>will you give me a call?
Yes.
Okay.
And that, kids,<br/>is how you turn a "no"
Into a "yes."
All my friends told me,<br/>"abby, be strong.
He doesn't deserve<br/>another chance."
No, no, no.<br/>But I forgive you!
No, no, no, no!
He seemed so nice,<br/>but then he just kept
Toying with my emotions.
Wow.
This ted guy<br/>sounds like a real jerk.
You know your problem?
You're too sweet.
Aren't you going to see<br/>the doctor about that mole?
Oh, yeah.
Turns out it's just a raisinet.
Hey, how would you like
Me to take you out<br/>to a fancy restaurant
And then go on a shopping spree?
Treat you the way<br/>you should be treated.
Would that make you forget<br/>about that ted monster?
My mom was wrong.
There are nice guys in new york.
We just have to go<br/>by my hotel room first.
My bed was broken.
I just have to make sure<br/>they fixed it.
Well, then if it's fixed,
Can we can have sex on it<br/>and then go shopping.
I like you.

[<div class="full-script">Narrator: Kids, back<br/>when we were younger,
Your uncle marshall and I were<br/>really into college basketball.
Every year, March madness would<br/>take over the entire apartment.
Hey. What's with<br/>the blackboard?
It's our ncaa bracket.
Big board equals big luck!
Hey, that looks familiar.
Where did you get it?
Hello.
Uh, I'm looking<br/>for my wife, ms. Aldrin.
There's no school today.<br/>It's Saturday.
(sighs) of course.<br/>How could I forget?
(laughs)
Dumb ass.
(snaps fingers)
♪
Big board!
Big luck!
We found it.<br/>No big deal.
Anyway,
Every year, ted and<br/>I go in together
On this big money pool<br/>out in staten island.
Ted:<br/>Yeah. The winner gets
$100,000 stuffed<br/>in a duffel bag.
And you get to keep<br/>the duffel bag.
Why do you guys<br/>put yourselves through this?
You lose every year.
Ted:<br/>That's because
In the past,<br/>we were just guessing.
This year,<br/>we watched every game,
Read box scores,<br/>tracked injuries.
This isn't March madness.
This is March meticulously<br/>thought-outness.
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.
I didn't know<br/>they were playing today.
(sighs)
You okay, barney?
Something strange is going on.
I was down at the<br/>hardware store,
Trying to get<br/>a little somethin' somethin'.
Wait. You go<br/>to the hardware store
To pick up girls?
There are four kinds of women
Who go to the hardware store<br/>by themselves.
Of course there are.
Single, recently single,<br/>recently divorced,
Lesbian who will let me watch.
You could not be more evil.
Sorry. Five.
Recently widowed. Mm.
So, I'm talking to this girl...
Look, I'm sure he's<br/>in a better place.
Now let's find you<br/>a sturdier ladder.
I was only gone<br/>for a second when...
See? Skid-proof.
The same thing happened<br/>at the pet store yesterday.
Pet store?
Single girl, mid-twenties,
Looking for a canine replacement
For the boyfriend<br/>who just dumped her.
Instead, finds barney.
God bless you, ted.
You're reading my blog.
I'm really bored at work.
I'd call your ex a dog,
But that would be an insult<br/>to little ladybug here.
Oh, I want to take<br/>her home right now.
Not without a chew toy<br/>from uncle barney first.
(laughing) okay.
Barney:<br/>And when I got back...
I'm sorry, I'm already<br/>spoiling her,
But diamond in the ruff?
Could your heart just melt?
Jerk!
(muffled):<br/>Okay.
Weird, right?
Yeah. The same thing happened<br/>last week at the museum.
All: Ooh, ooh, ooh! Lily.
You pretend to be a<br/>struggling young artist
Who needs a new muse.
No. Marshall: Ooh,<br/>ooh, ooh, ooh.
Casing the joint for a thrill
Money can no longer give you!
Oh. No.
Robin.
You're going blind,
And you're trying<br/>to soak up all the beauty
In the world<br/>before the darkness descends.
Bingo!<br/>(groaning)
So, I was talking to this girl.
At this point, about 83%.
Soon, these audio guides<br/>will be all that I have left.
I'm so sorry.
My god, you are beautiful.
Oh.<br/>Hey.
How about I get you a headset
So you can see with<br/>your ears like I do?
Uh...
Aah!
I'm s...
Aah! I...
I couldn't have been gone<br/>more than 20 seconds,
But when I came back...
Hmm. You know, I also love<br/>the smell of great art.
(groans)
Why does this keep happening?
Maybe you're not as good a<br/>liar as you think you are.
Hmm.
Oh, really?
Then why am I not<br/>in prison for perjury?
But I don't want<br/>to talk about work.
Something
Weird is going on here.
Narrator: But the next<br/>night got even weirder.
Alan alda.
It was alan alda.
You never gonna believe<br/>what just happened.
Who was that, um, guy from mash?
The main guy. What...?
Hawkeye from mash.
How can I be blanking on this?
Alan alda?
No.
Woman: Hey, a word of advice?
That guy you were talking<br/>to, barney stinson...
I know he seems charming,
But he's just saying<br/>whatever it takes
To get in your pants.
Sleeping with barney was the<br/>biggest mistake of my life.
Oh, my god. Where is she?
Oh.
She must have left.<br/>She...
Well, she-she said<br/>I hooked up with her?
What was her name?<br/>What did she look like?
She didn't say her name,<br/>but she had blonde hair, boobs.
Kind of trashy.
Dead in the eyes with an aura<br/>of self-loathing and despair?
Yes!<br/>That's all of them.
Okay. Stay calm.
Let's think this through.
One of the girls
Who I lied to,<br/>seduced and abandoned
Is trying to ruin my life.
Shouldn't be too hard<br/>to figure out which one it is.
Oh, dear god!
This is a nightmare.
Some woman that I slept with
And screwed over is trying<br/>to ruin my life.
God, why is this happening<br/>to me?
It's karma.
Nah, it's not karma.
She's stripping in vegas.
Plus, we're good.
Ted: Look, if you<br/>want to figure out
Who it is, why don't you just<br/>start by checking your list?
My list?
Dude, do not pretend<br/>you're not the kind of guy
Who keeps a list of all<br/>the girls he's slept with.
I have one.
It's called my marriage license.
Come on, let's see the list.
Ted, don't be crass.
I would never
Demean the women
That I've slept with<br/>by putting their names
On some tawdry list.
This is a scrapbook
Of all of the women<br/>I've slept with.
I made it at the<br/>scrapbook barn on 7th.
Ask for heloise.<br/>Tell her I sent you.
(scoffs quietly)
What do you think, lil?
You recognize the saboteur?
I don't know, barney.
I only saw her face.
(laughs) how many
Of these girls know<br/>they're being photographed?
All of them, but only about half<br/>buy a copy on the way out.
Oh, barney,<br/>you're never gonna figure out
Which one of these<br/>is the mystery woman.
All of these women have a right<br/>to hate you.
Oh, lily, come on, lighten up.
I mean, any girl who's gonna<br/>be with a guy like barney
And do this or that,
Or this and that,
Or do this with those in that...
Hmm. I mean, she should have<br/>known what she was getting into.
Absolutely.<br/>Mm.
And what I do with these women
Should be between me and them.
And you guys.
And heloise.
She helped me do the decoupage.<br/>Hmm.
I don't know, barney.
I don't recognize any<br/>of these women.
I mean, some minor celebrities,<br/>one government official,
And what appears to be a<br/>national fast food chain mascot.
Oh.
This is impossible.
There's too many girls.
How the hell am I gonna<br/>narrow this down?
The top 64 women<br/>I've slept with,
Split into four regions.
This tournament
Will systematically narrow down
Which girl has the most cause<br/>to hate my guts.
Last girl standing<br/>has to be the saboteur.
Absolutely not, barney.
We are not going to make a game
Out of the women you've tricked<br/>into sleeping with you.
(all talking at once) no way!
The girl who thought<br/>he had 12 hours to live
Has way more cause<br/>to ruin his life
Than the girl<br/>he fake proposed to.
It's fake proposal girl.
I mean, she hired<br/>a wedding planner!
It's 12 hours to live! That girl<br/>flew them both to paris!
Oh, she only bought him<br/>a one-way ticket!
(all talking at once)
Okay, okay,<br/>everybody! Hands.
Marshall, ted &amp; lily:<br/>12 hours to live!
Damn it!<br/>Yeah.
Okay, toss up.
"Thought I was jorge posada,"
Or "you have my dead wife's<br/>kidney?"
Kidney! Jorge posada!
She bought yankees season<br/>tickets to watch him play!
That's true... It's<br/>"dead wife's kidney."
How are we even discussing this?
Fake baby!<br/>Lost at sea!
Fake baby!<br/>Lost at sea!
I was there.
Trust me.
It's fake baby.
Down to the sweet 16.
And coming out of<br/>the upper west side, we have
The number three seed, "girl<br/>who thought I owned Google,"
Up against the number
Seven seed,
"girl who thought<br/>I was a scuba instructor."
You got to go scuba instructor.
You're kidding me!
She got the bends!
Yeah, she did.
Boo.
Evil twin!
Prince of norway!
How could it not be<br/>prince of norway?!
Barney, you're the tiebreaker.
I'm going with evil twin.
(all talking) you're kidding me!
Sorry, but I did sleep<br/>with that girl twice.
As barney and larney.
Okay, we're down<br/>to the final four.
What do you think, people?
Come on, dig deep.
Oh! I can't decide.
It could be any one of them.
Is that the blackboard<br/>from my classroom?
Come on! Marshall?
I'm tired and sad.
Mosby?
(voice breaking):<br/>I want to call my mom,
Just tell her I love her.
Okay.
Then this is as far as we get.
The final four.
It's got to be meg, anna,
Kate or holly.
We are gonna<br/>track these girls down,
And you're going to tell me
Which one approached you<br/>at the bar.
You guys stole my blackboard!
Okay, there's her building.
When she comes out,<br/>I'm gonna hide,
And once you figure out<br/>if she's the girl
From the bar, we run like hell.
No.
What do you mean, no?
That woman, like every woman
In your final four,<br/>deserves an apology,
And I'm not telling<br/>you if she's the one
Until I hear you<br/>say, "I'm sorry."
Are you nuts? That would involve<br/>me speaking to a woman
I've already had sex with,<br/>which, frankly,
Is a little bit like changing<br/>the oil in a rental car.
Ugh!
Barney, you're doing this.
Lily, this girl hates me.
I hooked up with her<br/>in an apartment
I was pretending was my own,
Told her I loved her,<br/>and then ditched her there.
She got arrested<br/>for trespassing,
Bit a cop, and spent<br/>eight days in jail.
Oh, crap, there she is!
If she sees me,<br/>she's gonna kill me!
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.<br/>Hey, meg!
Over here!
Look who it is!
Your old friend barney!
Barney?
If she kills me, I want you<br/>to go into my apartment,
Grab the metal briefcase<br/>under my bed
And throw it in the east river.
What are you doing here?
Look, meg, we need to talk.<br/>Shh.
It was all my fault.
I know it was, baby.
I just came on too strong.
And I forgive you.
I love you.
Oh, my god!
I love you, too!
No!
What's the matter with you?
Get off of him!
Look, she's not the one,
But you still owe her an apol...
So you remember who this<br/>one is, right? Yes.
You told her you were ted<br/>and that you were an architect.
Right, and if you recall,
Her computer had a web cam<br/>and a t-1 line, so I...
Yeah, I know, barney,<br/>you showed me.
And that still doesn't count<br/>as a christmas present.
Go over there and apologize.
Ah, there she is.<br/>Ooh,
And she's holding hot coffee.
Maybe she'll throw<br/>it in your face.
You're really enjoying this,<br/>aren't you?
I'm making a scrapbook.
Anna, hi.
Look who it is.
Mr. Big shot architect.
If you're here to ask me
To take down the web site,<br/>forget it.
What web site?
Ted-mosby-is-a-jerk-dot-com.
You're right, I do deserve that.
That's all I came here to say.
You know what?
I don't care who knows about it.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I, ted mosby,
Am a jerk to women.
Tell your sisters.<br/>Tell your daughters
To stay away!
Ted-mosby-is-a-jerk-dot-com.
Narrator: And that little web<br/>site went on to get 400,000 hits.
Thanks, barney.
Okay, which one is this again?<br/>She's...
Larney!
Why?!
Is it her?
Die!<br/>Smile.
(grunting) you look good.
Have you lost weight?
We're down<br/>to the number one seed.
I knew it was holly.
It had to be holly.
Man, I was hoping<br/>it wasn't holly.
(car door slams, engine starts)
Barney, did you hear that?
Somebody's stealing my truck.
Barney?
(car leaving)
Barney!
(animal growling)
(shrieking)
That was the worst thing<br/>you've ever done.
That is the worst thing<br/>anyone has ever done.
But in my defense,
She was kind of annoying.
She's gonna kill you.
Barney.<br/>Holly.
Mark, come over here.
Barney, this is my fiancé, mark.
Barney?
You're the barney who ditched<br/>her in the woods?
(laughs)
So you're not mad at barney?
Don't you want an apology?
An admission of guilt?
Your truck back?
No, whatever happened<br/>was in the past.
Mark is my present<br/>and my future.
Mark: And if you ditching<br/>holly in the woods
Made her stop running around<br/>with guys like you,
Then cheers.
Well, then,
To the last<br/>fourth of July weekend
I'll spend getting eaten alive<br/>by mosquitoes.
Fourth of July?
We started dating in June.
(chuckles)
We ruined their lives.
And the worst part of it
Is that you didn't apologize<br/>to any of those women.
No, the worst part is that
We still have no idea<br/>who my stalker is.
Well, that's because you're<br/>going about this all wrong.
I mean, why chase someone<br/>who's following you?
All you need to do
Is go down to the bar,<br/>hit on someone,
And wait until she turns up.
That's not a bad idea.
Ooh, ooh, I'll pretend to be<br/>the girl that you're hitting on.
I don't know.<br/>That's a lot riding on a girl
Who giggles when she lies.
I do not.
Have you ever fallen asleep<br/>while eating ribs?
(giggling):<br/>No.
Look, I can do this, okay?
I mean, how else are you<br/>going to find out
Who this girl is.
I'm in.
Okay, here's<br/>how it's gonna work.
Now, lily,
She knows what you look like,
So just hang out at the jukebox,
And don't draw any attention<br/>to yourself.
And the guys will be<br/>in the booth,
Just pretending to have<br/>a normal conversation.
Talking, we should<br/>be talking. Words.
Here are words.
Why is this so hard?
(laughing)
Laughter!
And then I'll come in,
Looking hot as all hell.
Wow, you are gorgeous.
Oh, god, I know that's awful.
I just, uh...<br/>Shh, go away.
But come back later.
And then barney<br/>will make his move.
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Fine, barney.
I mean, um,
Fine, stranger.
(giggles)
Wow, you really<br/>are awful at this, aren't you?
Get your hand
Off my thigh, barney.
It's supposed to look like
We're about to hook up, robin.
You know, I'm curious.
What do you say to these girls
To get them to come<br/>home with you?
Usually, I just
Lean in and whisper<br/>this one thing in their ear.
You're a little turned on right<br/>now, aren't you?
(giggling):<br/>No.
Oh. Look, somebody's<br/>watching us.
Make your move to the bathroom.
Uh, I'm going to go<br/>to the bathroom now,
But, uh, when I come back<br/>we'll go to my place
And have sex.
Ted:<br/>Dude, dude, dude, look.
Blonde girl heading over<br/>to robin right now. We are go.
I don't know<br/>what to do with my hands.
What do I normally do<br/>with my hands?
Barney.
I brought a copy of the bracket.
Which one is she?
I don't recognize her.
She's not on the top 64.
Not even on bracket.
Wow, cinderella story
Comes out of nowhere<br/>to win the whole thing.
That'll warm your heart.
Are you okay?
I don't even recognize her.
Hey.
I don't remember you.
I've spent the last<br/>two days trying to remember
Every girl that I've slept with<br/>and all the horrible things
That I have done to them.
And I have done<br/>some horrible things.
I mean,
At one point,<br/>I'm pretty sure I sold a woman.
I didn't speak the language,
But I shook a guy's hand,<br/>he gave me
The keys to a mercedes,<br/>and I left her there.
I'm the guy who keeps<br/>a scrapbook
Of all of the women<br/>I have slept with,
But I never thought<br/>I was the guy
Who would sleep with a girl<br/>and not even remember her.
So from the bottom of my heart,
For whatever I did to you,
I apologize.
Oh, barney!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
That's not her.
I'm so sorry.<br/>What? What?
Barney, I'm sorry, that's<br/>my friend sally from work.
We just ran into each other.
So I apologized for nothing?
Yes, but it was a great apology.
And a perfect way<br/>to end my scrapbook.
I'm going to call this photo<br/>"barney's redemption."
Could you stop<br/>giving me the finger?
♪ One shining moment
♪ you reached for the sky
♪ one shining moment you knew
♪ one shining moment
♪ you were willing to try
♪ one shining moment
Narrator: Eventually,<br/>barney did figure out
Who the mysterious girl was.
But more on that later.
(doogie howser, md<br/>theme music playing)
Barney, come back to bed.
You have a shuttle launch<br/>tomorrow.
And that asteroid that's<br/>headed for manhattan,
It's not going<br/>to destroy itself.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Narrator: Kids, the spring of 2008<br/>was a pretty great time for me.
Stella and I had started dating,
And I'd just gotten<br/>a big raise at work,
So I decided to purchase<br/>something I knew
Would be the envy<br/>of all my friends.
A new car!
Ted, this is new york city...<br/>you're never gonna drive it.
This is a really,<br/>really stupid purchase,
And I'm sorry, but none<br/>of us can support it.
Shotgun for eternity!
You can't call shotgun<br/>for eternity.
I just called it.
You can't just call<br/>things, barney.
I call that I can call things!
Nah-uh. Yeah-huh. Hey, baby.
Beer.
Are you okay?
Beer.
(whimpers)
Okay, what happened?
They always told me that,
That working at a big law firm
Was like being at war.
Marshall:<br/>You get out of law school,
It's like getting<br/>out of boot camp.
That first day at work,
You're storming the beaches,
Full of piss and vinegar...
Dude, we're lawyers now.
Totally.
We've got briefcases<br/>and everything.
Freakin' briefcases.
You have anything in yours?
Totally empty. You?
Candy bars.
Oh!
Then you get in the trenches<br/>side by side with your buddies,
And you feel<br/>a sense of camaraderie.
But before too long...
Hey, marshall.
The shells start to fall.
Hello, arthur.
Arthur hobbes<br/>is one of the senior partners
At my firm, and he's...<br/>He's my boss.
He seems like a nice guy,
But he's got a nickname...
Artillery arthur.
How's your morning going?
It's going fine; how is yours?
Not too bad, not too bad.
Hey, is ferguson in yet?
He is, he's in...<br/>Just in his office next door.
That's great.<br/>Have a good one, buddy.
You, too.
You never know<br/>who's gonna get hit...
Arthur:<br/>Hey, ferguson!
I read your report,<br/>and it's complete crap!
No, you know what?<br/>That's an insult to crap.
If crap could eat and then<br/>crap stuff out, it's that!
Your report is the<br/>crap that crap craps!
If you last two more days<br/>here, I'll be shocked!
Shocked!
(door slams)
It was brutal,
But the worst<br/>was a few minutes later.
Did you hear that?
Yeah, sorry.
Can you believe he did that
On take your daughter<br/>to work day?
So that brings us to today.
Oh, no.
A little background.
So I'm working on this report
Called "using 23-b-3 spurious<br/>class action precedent"
"to contest<br/>a class certification order
Based on a lack of commonality,<br/>numerosity..."
Dude, you lost us.
Can't you just<br/>call it something cool
Like "the ninja report"?
Okay. Yeah, fine,<br/>whatever.
Um, so I'm supposed
To turn in "the ninja report"<br/>yesterday.
Awesome. Ooh... Oh, wow. Cool.
But I got insanely busy<br/>with other stuff,
I didn't get<br/>a chance to finish it,
And then this morning...
Arthur: Hey, ferguson.<br/>Ferguson: Hey, arthur.
How's your day going?
I gotta go. Great. How is yours?
Great, great... hey,<br/>is marshall in yet?
Oh, thank god.
Yeah, he's right in there.
Fantastic. Have a<br/>good one, buddy.
And then...
He screamed at me.
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
What, that's it?
You're upset because a guy<br/>talked loudly near you?
Barney, I have never<br/>been screamed at
Like that in my life.
Come on, when's the last time
You got screamed at at work?
I got screamed at<br/>three times today.
Once in Korean.
This is corporate<br/>america, marshall.
Screaming is a<br/>motivational tool,
Like christmas bonuses<br/>or sexual harassment.
It's just good business.
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.
You've been working so hard.
Late nights, weekends.
I never see you.
We've barely made love in weeks.
(lily moaning)
It's bad, guys;<br/>mama needs her sugar.
Look, marshall, he screamed<br/>at you, you took it.
He probably respects you<br/>more for it.
Yeah, about that...
So arthur's busy giving me<br/>the full screaming treatment...
Face turning red,
Vein in his forehead<br/>about to burst,
Spittle flying like shrapnel.
Everyone you work with<br/>walking by your office,
Peering in.
And suddenly,<br/>I just felt all of it.
All of what?
All of it.
The fact that I became a lawyer<br/>to save the environment,
And now I'm working<br/>for the bad guys instead.
The fact that I am stuck<br/>in this job
Because of a mortgage<br/>I can barely afford
On an apartment that is crooked.
The fact that
I am a grown man,
And nobody,<br/>not even artillery arthur,
Has the right<br/>to talk to me like that!
Uh-oh.
I begged my body not to do it.
But it was no use.
Oh, god!
(sobbing)
I just...<br/>I just... I just...
Just because you<br/>weren't around for this,
I called shotgun for all<br/>eternity in ted's car.
Dude, I can't believe you<br/>cried in front of your boss.
I don't know what happened.
There's just something about<br/>being yelled at like that,
Like I was being<br/>scolded by my dad.
Suddenly...<br/>Suddenly I was a little boy.
Is "boy" the right word?
I felt absolutely powerless.
Flaccid... hell, I...<br/>I felt castrated.
God, you're hot right now.
And the worst thing is,<br/>tomorrow morning I have to walk
Into arthur's office<br/>and give him the ninja report.
Ooh. Ooh. Ninjas are cool.
How the hell am I supposed<br/>to face this guy again?
Here's what I would do<br/>if I were you.
Hi, arthur.
Hello, marshall.
Have you finally finished<br/>the ninja report?
Yeah, I got it.
Right here.
I think it's gonna<br/>blow you away.
Please, I have a family.
So we good?
We're so good.
Then why are you<br/>still in my office?
Okay, gun violence might be<br/>the answer to everything
Up in canada, robin,
But here in america, we solve<br/>our problems with words.
Marshall, you go in<br/>and you dazzle this guy
With a big eloquent speech<br/>defending human dignity.
Like abraham lincoln.
Yeah, because it's so easy<br/>just to bust out a big,
Eloquent speech<br/>off the top of your head.
(clears throat) observe.
Arthur?
What do you want, marshall?
Justice, sir.
You see, we are all born with<br/>certain incontrovertible rights,
The most fundamentally paramount<br/>of which
Is the right...
Wait, you can't<br/>be fundamentally paramount.
One means highest,<br/>one means lowest.
You are nailing this.
Human beings have rights,
And those rights are, um...
You got me hooked, reel me in.
There are certain justices
That cannot or will not
Be inalienable...<br/>As such...
For the future.
Stuck the landing... bravo!
Thank you.
(laughs) (intercom beeps)
Security's gonna rough you up<br/>a bit on the way out.
(lily, robin and barney laugh)
Guys, guys, this<br/>is not helping, okay?
I can't have some<br/>big confrontation with arthur.
I need this job,<br/>I... I need the money.
Yeah, but how good would it feel<br/>to walk in there tomorrow,
Tell him off and then quit?
It's great to fantasize about,
But nobody<br/>ever actually does it.
Gary blauman did it.
Guy I used to work with,<br/>the guy's a legend now.
We were at the morning meeting,<br/>and old blauman
Was getting reamed out but good.
Barney:<br/>Pretty much routine
At the morning meeting,<br/>but then,
On this particular day,<br/>something amazing happened.
You made yourself look bad,
You made this company look<br/>bad, and quite frankly,
You made our friends,<br/>the north koreans, look bad!
And I'll tell<br/>you something else,
Blauman,<br/>if you think for one moment...
You know what, bilson?
You can kiss my ass.
Oh, snap.
What?<br/>You heard me.
I don't need<br/>to take your crap anymore.
My cousin's website<br/>went public today,
And I made a pile of money
On the ipo,<br/>so you know what I think
Of this whole damn company?
O-kay.
(unzipping)
Oh, my god.
He peed on the conference table?
Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on,<br/>come on, come on.
Uh, look, could you guys<br/>just look away for a second
Till I get started?
Come on.
Come on.
Does this help?
Eventually, he just<br/>gave up and left.
And then his cousin's<br/>website tanked.
And then he became a janitor<br/>at an old folks' home
And moved into a one-room<br/>apartment above a bowling alley.
That's it?<br/>That's the end of the story?
No, no, of course<br/>not... he died.
How does that help me?
How does any of this help me?
Can somebody, for god's sakes,
Please give me<br/>one piece of useful advice?
Lily, control your woman.
The lesson of blauman<br/>is that when your boss
Screams at you, you<br/>never scream back.
That's why there's a little<br/>thing in corporate america
I like to call the<br/>chain of screaming.
Chain of screaming?<br/>Yes.
The chain of screaming<br/>starts at the top.
Barney: Arthur's boss's boss<br/>screams at arthur's boss.
Arthur's boss screams at arthur.
Arthur screams at you.
You go home and scream at lily.
Lily screams at one of the kids<br/>in her kindergarten class.
Then that kid<br/>screams at her dad,
Arthur's boss's boss.
And the whole thing<br/>starts all over again,
Thus completing the<br/>circle of screaming.
I thought it was<br/>a chain of screaming.
It's a circle, ted,<br/>I called it a circle.
I don't scream at lily.
And I don't scream at my kids,
None of whom have parents<br/>who work at marshall's firm.
So it's not a circle.
Fine... you want it to be<br/>a chain of screaming,
It's a chain of screaming.
I came up with the circle<br/>idea halfway through,
'cause I thought it was<br/>a more elegant metaphor,
But fine, ruin it!
You guys always undermine me
When I'm trying to make a<br/>point, and I'm sick of it!
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!
Idiots!
See, doesn't everyone<br/>feel better now?
Lily, I need your take on this.
What... What should I do?
Well, what I teach my<br/>kids in kindergarten...
Oh, god.
Is, when dealing with a bully,
The most important thing
Is to be constructive<br/>and positive.
Hello, arthur.
Hello, marshall.
I have the ninja report<br/>right here.
But arthur,
In the future, if you want<br/>someone to do their best work,
Try to motivate them<br/>not with fear and intimidation,
But through encouragement,<br/>inspiration and respect.
Well said, marshall.
I... I needed to hear that.
By the way,
I saw your wife's picture<br/>in your office.
That is one tasty slice.
Oh, you're damn right.
You know what I'm gonna do<br/>when I get home?
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna rip<br/>that girl's clothes off...
That's it.
Just throw her on the bed...
That's where she belongs.
And drive her home<br/>like a pack of sled dogs!
Oh, yeah!<br/>Yeah!
(both laugh)
It's bad, guys.
Mama needs it bad.
You're right, baby,<br/>it's about respect.
That is the first useful thing<br/>anyone's said to me tonight.
Can you give me<br/>that speech again?
I'm gonna drive her<br/>home like a pack of...
No, the other part, please.
I have the ninja report<br/>right here, but...
Narrator: And it seemed like<br/>that was the end of it,
But it wasn't,<br/>because the next night...
Which of these carpets<br/>would look better
In the new apartment?
I like the color of this one,<br/>but this one's so soft.
It would feel great<br/>on your bare feet...
Or your bare back,<br/>a bead of eager sweat
Rolling down
Your trembling bosom.
(moans)
Lily, didn't we just go through<br/>this with bathroom tiles?
(cell phone rings)
Hey.
Shh, don't say my name.
Lily can't know it's me.
Just pretend<br/>you're talking to stella.
Be all lovey dovey.
Hey, stella.
Sweetie, how's it going?
(imitates woman's voice):<br/>Not good, not good at all.
Where are you right now?
Right downstairs, come find me.
Without lily.
Okay, I'll, uh,<br/>I'll see you soon.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow, you two are already<br/>saying the "I" word, huh?
Apparently.
You hittin' that?
Uh-oh.
I'm in trouble, ted.
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.
Um... It's a new car,<br/>so just be careful...
I did something stupid...<br/>Can we just drive somewhere?
I need to get away...<br/>Just drive, man.
Please just drive.
It's just, this is<br/>a really good parking spot.
Dude!
Look, just tell me<br/>what happened first.
Okay. Remember how I said<br/>I was gonna give that big speech
That lily told me to give,<br/>be firm but respectful?
Well, it didn't totally<br/>go that way.
There is a lot of ketchup<br/>on that burger.
Sorry... what happened?
After we all finished<br/>talking last night,
I went to the diner to finish<br/>working on the ninja report.
Hey, marshall.
How long have you<br/>been sitting there?
If you go in there with<br/>lily's kindergarten nonsense,
You're gonna get torn apart.
I'm here to save your life...<br/>You hungry?
Yeah, I was just about to order.
What do you want?
A bit and gravy fries.
Mmm.
Okay, friends,
What do you like?
A green tea with lemon for me,
And for my friend here,<br/>the meatloaf, please.
Very good.
No, I didn't want meatloaf.
Marshall, the chain of screaming<br/>is a real thing.
Arthur screamed at you; now you<br/>have to scream at someone else.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do,
Or else that anger<br/>is gonna eat you alive.
Who would I even scream at?
I don't know.
How about somebody<br/>who's disappointed you?
Someone who's let you down?
Someone who's gonna<br/>bring you meatloaf
When you explicitly ordered<br/>a bit and gravy fries?
No.
Hey, I was just<br/>heading to the bar.
What are you guys<br/>doing out here?
Oh, I was just<br/>telling ted a story.
Ooh, I like stories.
You want a lick?
What? Is that ice cream<br/>cone big enough?
Uh, it's delicious enough.
Okay, so...
Then I say to barney...
I'm not gonna scream<br/>at the waiter, barney.
Yes, you are.
That waiter is every boss
And every bully
Who ever embarrassed<br/>or belittled you.
And how dare he deny you
The one thing that you want,
That would make you happy<br/>at this moment,
A bit and gravy fries!
One green tea with lemon,<br/>one meatloaf.
Enjoy, my friends.
(whispering):<br/>Marshall.
Excuse me?
Yes?
This is not what I ordered.
(chuckles) yes, it is.
I beg your pardon, sir,
But I ordered a bit<br/>and gravy fries,
And as the customer,<br/>I'm always right, so...
No, no, I am not going to<br/>stand here and take this!
I am at the end of a triple<br/>shift... that's 18 hours!...
And then I have
To take two trains<br/>and a bus to astoria
To have my wife scream at me<br/>because I'm never home.
No, no, you eat<br/>your damn meatloaf!
Hey, what are you guys<br/>doing out here?
Oh, sweet, can I get a toot?
Against car rules,<br/>it's against car rules!
Oh, ted, relax, it's cuban.
People pay to have their car<br/>smell like this.
Well, that's just not true.
Oh, marshall,<br/>switch seats with me.
I called shotgun<br/>for all eternity.
You can't call shotgun<br/>for eternity.
Well, that's funny,<br/>'cause I did!
It's case by case.
Guys, I'm telling<br/>a life-altering story here!
A 20% tip, really,<br/>for that waiter?
I don't know, barney, he worked a triple...<br/>I can't believe...
You know what, if you're not<br/>gonna yell at the waiter,
Yell at me.
What?<br/>Yell at me.
I'm not gonna yell<br/>at you, barney.
What, what, you think<br/>you're gonna upset me?
Please, give me your best shot.
Okay, fine... what,<br/>you want me to yell at you?
Yeah.
This is me
Yelling at you, barney.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you<br/>over the sound of a butterfly
Landing on a leaf<br/>about three blocks away.
This is me<br/>yelling at you, barney!
Okay, you got some volume,<br/>now give me some content.
Make it hurt.
You don't look as good in suits<br/>as you think you do!
No, something that's true...<br/>Come on.
The man made you cry.
Make me cry.
Your mom's a slut!
Yes.
Your mom's a slut,<br/>and I'm sorry, barney,
But you and your brother<br/>clearly have different fathers,
And you know why?
It's probably because<br/>your mom is a slutty slut!
Keep going.
I don't care what you say.
Bob barker is not your father!
Okay, now, well,<br/>that's just not cool.
Oh, my god, barney,<br/>I'm so sorry, I really...
No, I'm kidding...<br/>Keep going.
Bob barker's not your father!
You've concocted this delusional<br/>idea that a game show host
Is your real father,<br/>and he's not!
You were abandoned, barney!
You were abandoned,<br/>and you never dealt with it,
And so now<br/>you never allow yourself
To feel anything,<br/>and that's how you survive
In this corporate world,<br/>and if I keep heading
Down this path,<br/>I'm gonna turn into you!
And I don't want that!
I don't want any of this!
This is not<br/>why I became a lawyer.
This is not the person<br/>that I wanted to be.
I quit, arthur!
I quit!
Well, thank you, eriksen,<br/>I needed to hear that.
Really, 'cause I didn't mean<br/>to attack you personally,
It's just that I...
No, no, no, the part<br/>where you said, "I quit."
Now we don't have to pay you<br/>a severance package.
(intercom beeps)
Uh, security's gonna rough you<br/>up a bit on the way out.
(clears throat)
Robin, you dropped<br/>a little ice cream...
Dude! Dude! Dude!
I'm sorry.
Don't blame this<br/>on me, marshall.
I told you to yell<br/>at someone beneath you.
The circle of screaming is...
The chain of scr...
Pyramid...<br/>The pyramid of screaming!
The pyramid of screaming.
How am I supposed to tell lily?
She supported me through<br/>three years of law school,
And now is the time when<br/>I'm supposed to pay her back.
Now we're gonna lose<br/>the apartment.
The place where we were gonna<br/>raise our children.
How am I supposed to tell<br/>the person who I love
More than anything in this world
That I've just thrown away<br/>our future?
(knocks) hey.
(everybody screams)
Everybody out, everybody<br/>out of the new car!
Out of the new car!
Ted, screaming<br/>never solves anything.
Narrator: And so, marshall finally<br/>had to tell lily what happened.
I'm so sorry.
I just lost it.
But I can fix it.
First thing tomorrow,<br/>I'm gonna go in there
On my hands and knees and...<br/>And beg for my job back.
No, you're not.
What?
Marshall, our future isn't<br/>money or an apartment.
And it's definitely not<br/>you being miserable
At that horrible job.
I'm just happy to<br/>have my husband back.
We'll figure the rest out.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Narrator: Ultimately, they<br/>were able to make ends meet
Without going bust<br/>on the apartment.
You sure about this?
Yeah, who needs a car<br/>in new york city, right?
Ted, I don't think<br/>I can accept...
Marshall, don't make me<br/>scream at you.
Thanks a lot, buddy.
You guys did it in the car,<br/>didn't...
Oh, yeah.
(groans)
(exhales)
Definitely this one.
Yeah.
(exhales) (exhales)

[<div class="full-script">Narrator: Now, kids, when aunt robin<br/>was a teenager she was, well...
A canadian pop star.
But by 2008, she was an<br/>entirely different person...
(gunfire)
Coming up next:<br/>Is your baby trying to kill you?
Narrator: Which made<br/>the events of that week
All the more surprising.
So, I go in this morning<br/>and... brr!... It's freezing!
So I walk over there, and I don't<br/>know why I'm still talking
Because, clearly, we're all<br/>asking the same question:
What in god's creation is<br/>going on with robin's breasts?
I know! Right?<br/>Isn't it amazing?
I spent half an hour<br/>making this happen.
There's tape in there,<br/>cotton balls,
Half of a nerf football,<br/>but it works, right?
Totally.<br/>What's the occasion?
And old friend from canada<br/>is in town,
And I'm meeting him for a drink.
Ooh! Somebody you went<br/>to degrassi with?
No. Actually, he was<br/>my first boyfriend.
Simon. I thought<br/>he was the coolest guy ever.
He smelled like drakkar.
He could ollie on a skateboard.
And he had the most amazing<br/>collection
Of hard rock cafe t-shirts.
We spent the whole summer<br/>madly in love.
Tell me more.<br/>Tell me more.
Like, did he have a car?
So he's the guy who...
How shall I say this<br/>like a gentleman?
Robin, did he take<br/>your maple leaf?
No, it wasn't like that.
Sounds to me like he gave you<br/>your first "o canada" face.
Narrator: This went on<br/>for a really long time.
Some of the jokes were elegant<br/>and well-crafted...
Wait, wait.<br/>Did he break up with you
And tell you he's<br/>just not that inuit?
(laughing)
Narrator: Others were<br/>crude, and ill-formed...
Um, something<br/>about fur trapping.
Narrator: And others were<br/>obvious, but needed to be said...
Did you ride his zamboni?
Oh! Come on! Oh!
(laughter)
Wait, wait, wait.<br/>Did he...?
I think I'm out.
Yeah, I'm also "oot."
(laughs)
Okay, now I'm really out.
Well, I'm sorry, guys.<br/>It was all very tame.
We only dated<br/>for a week and a half.
Wha...? I thought you said<br/>you were together all summer.
Yeah. Summer in canada is pretty<br/>much the last week of July.
Anyway, one night,
His band just finish playing<br/>this gig...
(panting)
Oh, my god! Simon.
That was such a good show.
You guys totally rocked out.
Yeah.
I know.
I figure we're about<br/>four or five gigs away
From really exploding.
We're gonna be big, babe.
I mean, like<br/>crash-test-dummies big.
So, that everything?
Yeah.
All right.
Listen, babe...
It's over.
What?
I'm getting back together<br/>with louise marsh.
Louise marsh?!
That's a whore's name<br/>if I ever heard one.
Yeah, why would he want to get<br/>back together with louise marsh?
Well, the thing is...
Her folks just put in a pool.
Oh...<br/>So...
Totally... I get it.
Pools are great.
Swimming's awesome.
We have a sprinkler.
Run right through it.
Well, I should go.
Uh...
Babe, wait.
Yeah, simon?
You forgot to load the drum set.
No!
Tell me you did not load<br/>the drum set.
(drums feet):<br/>I did.
(all groaning)
And now he's coming here?
Robin, why do you want<br/>to see this guy?
Oh! I know why.
You're gonna win, aren't you?
I have no idea what<br/>you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Whenever you haven't seen<br/>someone for a long time,
No matter how much<br/>you want to deny it,
There's always a clear winner<br/>and a clear loser.
Well, since you brought it up,
Let's add up the points.
You're starting out<br/>with two big ones right there.
Thank you.
Okay. So, simon still<br/>lives with his mom.
Point robin.
Um, he never became
A rock star.
Point robin.
He now works at a water slide<br/>park outside of ottawa.
Point simon.
Wait. Do they have<br/>a wave pool?
No.
Ah. Point robin.<br/>That's five-zip.
There's no coming<br/>back from that.
Yeah, he's going down.
I mean, unless somehow,<br/>he got hotter.
There he is.
Narrator: And sure enough,<br/>there was a clear winner
And a clear loser.
Narrator: It just wasn't<br/>clear to everybody.
Hey, babe.
(giggling):<br/>Oh, my god.
Okay, what the hell<br/>just happened?
Oh, come on, it wasn't<br/>so bad, was it?
(others groan)
Hey, simon.
Wow, look at you.
You got old.
Yeah. You look great.
You got hotter,
Like that's possible.
(robin giggles)
So...
Look, I know it didn't go<br/>as planned, but...
I can't help it.
I mean...
He's still got it.
Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?
What a rip.
Good thing I'm packing.
(laughs)
So he's not a snob.
He's from a different part
Of canada, you know?
The maple leaf flag on the back<br/>of the pickup truck?
He's red province.
He's from the deep north.
And the thing is,
We gave you so many<br/>opportunities.
So, simon,
Robin's a bit of a local<br/>celebrity here in new york.
She's the lead anchor
At metro news one.<br/>Tell him, robin.
No. It's stupid.
It's not cool,<br/>like simon's shirt.
I'm sorry, simon.
Here we are nattering on<br/>about our big celebrity.
What do you do for a living?
Oh, I work at the splish splash<br/>ottawa water slide park.
Huh! A water slide park.
That sure is different<br/>than what robin does.
Yeah, it is...<br/>Because I save lives.
If I'm not sitting in that stool
At the top of the slide,<br/>going...
Go...
Go...
Go...
People die.
What, you think it's so easy?
You try it.
Um... (clears throat)... Okay.
Go.
You didn't put your hand up;<br/>kid just died.
No, I didn't know...
Another kid just went;<br/>he died, too.
Oh, well, sure.<br/>I mean, if I was actually...
Another kid just went;<br/>now you've got a pile-up,
And robin's got something<br/>to report on the news.
This just in:
My friend, ted, killed<br/>a bunch of kids today.
Lily:<br/>Well, that's cool.
You got to pay the bills somehow
Since your whole music thing<br/>didn't really pan out, did it?
Well, it hasn't panned out yet,<br/>but the band's still going.
About four or five gigs
Away from really exploding.
The foreskins are still playing?
The foreskins?
How'd you guys come up<br/>with that name?
(sighs)<br/>well, there's four of us,
And we play without shirts.
Babe, seriously.
I know. I'm sorry.
I know. I'm sorry.
But you guys just<br/>don't understand.
The fact that he kept the band<br/>going... that's impressive.
I mean, I gave up<br/>my musical dream.
Which brings us to the<br/>most important piece
Of information from tonight.
So, simon,
How did you guys meet?
Oh, I was in her video.
Starred in it is more like it.
Well, once you win<br/>mr. Teen winnipeg,
Everybody wants a piece<br/>of the moneymaker.
I'm sorry. I've seen<br/>"let's go to the mall"
About a thousand times,<br/>and you, sir, are not in it.
I was in the other one.
There's another video?!
Robin, seriously,
Just make this<br/>easier on yourself
And give us the tape.
No.
All right.
You leave me no choice.
From this moment on,
I will spend every waking minute<br/>searching down this tape.
I will not sleep.<br/>I will not eat.
My life will be a living<br/>hell of search engines
And overseas phone calls,
Chasing down something<br/>that possibly can't be found.
Okay.
It's just...
It was so hard to watch, robin.
You're usually so cool.
I don't know<br/>what's wrong with me.
I'm sitting next to simon,<br/>and suddenly I'm 16 again.
Oh, it's actually<br/>a common thing.
When you're around<br/>someone from your past,
You kind of revert back
To who you were<br/>when you knew them.
There's not really a name<br/>for it, though.
It's called "revertigo."
Yeah, I don't know<br/>about "revertigo."
You know who gets<br/>really bad revertigo?
(whispers):<br/>Lily when she's around
Her high school<br/>friend, michelle.
Michelle? She sounds hot.
Wait, wait. You don't know<br/>about lily and michelle?
No. What about<br/>lily and michelle?
Oh, my friend,<br/>you are in for a treat.
Hey, lil?<br/>Lily: What?
You know, I was just thinking,
We haven't seen your friend<br/>michelle in a while.
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,<br/>see if she wants to hang out.
Yeah.
What... (stammers)<br/>do they make out?
Better.
Comparable.<br/>Comparable.
Ugh, whatever.<br/>It's over. I lost.
I guess you, uh,
You don't get a second chance.
I got a second chance.
What happened?
He came by my place tonight...
Simon.<br/>What are you doing here?
I just feel like there's<br/>some unfinished business
Between you and me.
Seeing you now...
Has made me realize<br/>that breaking up with you
Is the biggest mistake<br/>I made in my entire life.
Oh, I like where this is going.
I know this is crazy,
And I'm only in town<br/>for a couple of days,
But do you want to go on a date?
He asked you out?!
Oh, step into my web, simon.
The coup de grace.
(a la mortal kombat):<br/>Finish him!
I'd lo to!
(imitates pac man dying)
Wait. You're going<br/>on a date with simon?
That simon? The one we met?
Robin, this guy doesn't<br/>deserve a second chance.
Not after the way<br/>he treated you.
That was ten years ago.<br/>People evolve.
I mean, are you the same person<br/>that you were in high school?
Oh, hell, no!
I think you're gonna enjoy this.
That my girl michelle?<br/>Bitch, you know it!
How she livin'? She livin' the<br/>only way she know how to.
Large!
Oh, girl, you gots<br/>to get your drink on up in here.
I'm hoping my fat ass can<br/>hustle me up a vodka-gatorade.
For reals.
I want her around all the time.
I'd even consider not<br/>trying to sleep with her
If that's what it takes.
Guys, I've decided<br/>to seduce michelle.
(rock music playing)
(laughs)
(song ends)
(robin whoops)
Yeah!<br/>Guys, that was great.
Let's take five.
Hey, babe, did you like it<br/>after my bass solo
When I flicked my pick at you?
That rocked.
Yeah.
Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need<br/>that pick back.
Oh, uh, sure.
Um, I think it...
It's cool. You'll find it later.<br/>Oh, cool.
I wish I didn't have to go<br/>to work in the morning.
Oh, but, babe, you<br/>got to go to work.
You got to play our<br/>demo on your show.
Oh, well, you know,<br/>it's not a show.
It's the news.
Right. So you<br/>can be, like,
"hey, did you hear<br/>there's some news?
There's a rad band you<br/>guys should check out."
And then play it.
Or just, like, the<br/>first three songs.
And now it's time<br/>for "puppy corner,"

Hey, a lot of puppies<br/>got adopted.
Of course, a lot of the<br/>people calling in thought
We were going to kill them.
Robin, your revertigo is really<br/>starting to affect your work.
What's revertigo?
Stupid, made-up word<br/>with no meaning.
No. It's a<br/>phenomenon where,
When you're around<br/>people from your past,
You start behaving like them.
Oh. One example of that<br/>springs to mind.
I think we all know what it is.
We do?
Yeah. Ted.
Me?
Whenever ted's friend punchy<br/>comes into town,
It's like, all of a sudden,<br/>ted's in high school again.
Ted:<br/>Okay, okay.
First of all,<br/>his name is adam punciarello,
And I don't do that.
(both scoffing)
(knock at door,<br/>classical music playing)
Ooh. That must be adam.
'Sup, punchy?<br/>'sup, shmosby?!
You want to go?<br/>I'm already there!
Come on!<br/>This is it!
Dude, seriously,<br/>I'm sorry about your dad.
Yeah, it was a real shock.
I can't believe you, of all<br/>people, are saying this.
Why?
No reason.
Robin, the point is,<br/>what are you doing?
I mean, this guy?
Okay, you want the truth?
Yeah.<br/>I like simon.
I do.
We have fun together.
Oh, we know you do, honey,<br/>but we're worried about you.
You're worried?<br/>Okay, hold on.
Is there any version<br/>of this conversation
Where you guys don't sound<br/>like my parents?
I don't know.<br/>Is there any version
Where you don't sound<br/>like a 16-year-old?
That's exactly what<br/>my mom would say.
No. If I was your mom,<br/>I would say,
"we forbid you<br/>from seeing this boy."
(scoffs) lily!
No, I'm sorry,<br/>but it's for your own good.
This is my life!
You guys just don't get it!
You've never felt the way<br/>that I feel!
Now, now. We were once<br/>young and in love, too.
Yeah, like, a billion years ago.
You've been drinking,<br/>haven't you?
Yeah, we all have.
You bought the last round.
You're not going<br/>to that show tonight!
Oh, yes, I am,<br/>and you know what else?
Tonight, after the show,
Simon and I are going<br/>all the way!
(lily gasps)
Young lady, get back here!
Thanks for your help.
Hey, so, today at work...
Not now, ted!
Geez.
Ooh!
Oh, hey, simon.
Great show.
You guys still rock.
Yeah.
They totally dug my bass solo.
Man!
Why can't I always<br/>feel this alive?!
God, I just love<br/>seeing you so happy.
Yeah.<br/>(laughs)
About that.
Listen, babe.
It's over.<br/>What?
I'm getting back together<br/>with louise marsh.

You're kidding me.
You're breaking up with me?
Again?
F-for the same ex-girlfriend?
In the same van?
What is it?
Her-her parents got a pool?
Is that still the reason?
Well...
Her folks did just<br/>put in a jacuz.

I'm sorry, robin.
I'm fine, really.
Oh, robin, I'm gonna<br/>tell you for real.
Simon's a dawg.
You feel me, chelle?
Mm-hmm, for reals.
He a scrub.
Mm. True dat.
I'ma get me my champagne<br/>and grape soda on.
So, how's columbia?
Great!
I'm almost done<br/>with my dissertation.
Hmm. I'm getting a phd in<br/>behavioral psychology.
Um, can I make an observation?
Oh. I know.
Whenever I'm around lily,
She just brings out<br/>that side of me.
There's a psychological term<br/>for the phenomenon.

Oh! Oh, come here.

It's just...
When I was young, I was so...
Vulnerable and-and open<br/>to things, you know?
And... I guess I just...<br/>I wanted to feel that way again.
I wanted to be 16 again.
Robin, that is<br/>the stupidest thing
I've ever heard<br/>come out of your mouth.
You want to be 16 again?
I have watched your first
Robin sparkles video<br/>a thousand times,
And it's not because<br/>I'm proud of you as a friend.
It's because you were<br/>totally, totally lame back then.
But now, come on.<br/>Pa-kow!
You're the most awesome person<br/>I have ever known.
Well, second most awesome.
Right. Of course,<br/>the-the first being you.

No. The first is this guy

Oh.
I'm saying
That you are way more awesome<br/>than simon ever will be.
Barney, do you want to<br/>come back to my place?

[<div class="full-script">Narrator:<br/>Well, kids, here we are.
We've arrived.
My 30th birthday.
The long-awaited story of...
(bleating)
That week started<br/>just like any other.
Barney woke up<br/>in some girl's bed.
In my experience, the way<br/>this normally goes is,
We lie here for a while,
Make a little awkward chitchat.
Check.
Then I make up some<br/>cabinet meeting, heart surgery,
Rocket test flight<br/>I've got to be at,
Slip out of the apartment<br/>and never call you again.
And later at the bar,
You tell your good friend robin
The story of your<br/>latest conquest,
And she thinks to herself,
"who is this sad,<br/>self-loathing idiot
Who climbed into bed<br/>with barney stinson?"
Hmm.
Actually, you usually<br/>say that out loud.
(sighs)
So...
I just slept with<br/>my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
And I just slept
With my ex-boyfriend's<br/>really good friend.
Best friend.
Okay, here's the deal, barney.
The second my feet<br/>touch the ground,
This never happened.
Okay.
(sighs) wait.
Right click, save as...
Into the .Bpeg folder,<br/>and okay.
This never happened.
It's a good plan.
Now we go back to exactly<br/>the way things were before.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
So, robin?
Yes, barney?
Guess who nailed the chick<br/>from metro news 1 last night?
(chuckles)
Okay, uh, let me take a shower,
Till June, and, um,
Since you were never here<br/>to begin with,
You won't be here<br/>when I get out.
Okay.<br/>Okay.
This never happened.
(laughs)
Never happened.
Never... Happened.
Narrator: But pretending<br/>it never happened
Wouldn't be that easy.
Ted:<br/>So, tell us,
What was it like?
What?
Penetrating that barrier.
You and I are
The first ones to hit it.
Certainly, but the first<br/>ones at this table.
I... I... I...
I'm... I'm...
Although, I'm gonna be<br/>hitting it pretty soon.
Ted: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are.
Yeah, and when I hit it,<br/>I'm going to go nuts.
It's gonna be all night, and<br/>I think I want a clown there.
I'm a little bit scared of<br/>clowns, but for you, I'm there.
Lily:<br/>Yay!
What are you taking about?!
The big three-oh.
My 30th birthday's this Friday.
Did you forget?
What kind of friend is this guy?
Ha-ha, right.
A great friend, by the way.
The best.
Is it my imagination,
Or are these drinks<br/>getting smaller?
If this were a doctor's office,<br/>they'd say, "try again."
(airy laugh)
How you doing there, robin?
I'm good. Ted: Oh, so,<br/>I made a decision.
I'm going to go through<br/>all my old stuff,
And I'm getting rid of anything<br/>I have no use for anymore.
Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?
(gasping)
Ted, she has a name!
And just what are<br/>you accusing me of?
Liking video games?
I'm gonna get a drink.
Hmm.<br/>I'll come with you.
Okay.
God, this is awkward.
What is?
Being around ted.
Why?
Because of our thing.<br/>What thing?
You're really gonna pretend<br/>this never happened?
What never happened?
Hey.<br/>(whimpers)
Hey.
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Guys, cut the act. I know.
I know about the surprise party<br/>you guys are throwing me.
Marshall let it slip<br/>earlier today.
(mumbling) marshall.
Hey, I'll totally act surprised<br/>and everything.
Just be sure to invite stella.
Stella!
You have a serious<br/>girlfriend now!
You're over this one.
Robin who, right?
Stella makes this one look
Like a filthy bag<br/>of garbage, am I right?
Happy birthday, bro.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Hey, marshall, I need your help.
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused<br/>on the job hunt right now.
I know. I want to hire you.
For the last time, barney,<br/>I will not be your butler.
I need a lawyer.
I'll pay you.
How much?
A little.
I'll take it.
Hey.
Hey. So, I'm reading this,<br/>and, I got to say,
This might be<br/>a little bit over my head.
For one thing,<br/>I'm fairly certain
That if these contracts<br/>aren't executed precisely,
We will be at war with portugal.
Forget that.
That's a Tuesday for me.
New shredder.
This baby'll chew up a bicycle<br/>in 17 seconds.
From sky mall.<br/>It's all from sky mall.
Whenever I get upset,<br/>I shop at sky mall.
Want a hot dog?<br/>Of course.
Why are you upset?
Marshall, I'm about<br/>to tell you a secret
That you can't<br/>tell anyone... not ted,
Not robin, not lily.
No. No, no, no,<br/>I don't want any more secrets,
Especially now that I know<br/>what you guys did
To the drinking water<br/>in lisbon. I...
You are hearing<br/>this secret, marshall.
I... I slept...<br/>(scat singing)
Stop... Stop doing that.<br/>(singing)
I slept...
♪ laba-da bay-doh
♪ hicka-ba-ta-bo...

Hmm.
Are you mad at me?
I don't know.
How's the hot dog?
It's helping.
You slept with robin?!
I... I cannot keep that secret.
I mean, you know
I at least have to tell lily.
You can't.<br/>You can't tell anyone.
Attorney-client privilege.
(groans)<br/>why are you doing this to me?!
Because I need you,<br/>marshall, as my lawyer,
To prove<br/>that I didn't do anything wrong.
How can I help you<br/>as your lawyer?
You didn't break any laws,<br/>did you?
Robin knows you slept with her,<br/>doesn't she?
I didn't break any state<br/>or federal laws,
But I think I broke a much,<br/>much higher law.
The bro code.
♪
Narrator:<br/>For many years,
We had heard barney<br/>quote the bro code,
A list of do's<br/>and don'ts for all bros.
Some were basic.
Bro code article one:<br/>"bros before hoes."
Some were unbelievably<br/>complicated.
Bro code article 89:
"the mom of a bro<br/>is always off limits,
"but the stepmom of a bro is<br/>fair game if she initiates it,
"and/or is wearing<br/>at least one article
Of leopard print clothing."
And some were<br/>just plain disturbing.
Bro code article 34:
"bros cannot make eye contact<br/>during a devil's three-way."
Two dudes.
(mumbling)
This is not a legal document.
This is just something<br/>you wrote.
You think I wrote that?
Oh, marshall,
Don't you know<br/>the glorious history
Of the bro code?
The year was 1776.
The place: Philadelphia.
Benjamin franklin and george<br/>washington were having a drink.
But, bro, seriously,
I calleth dibs on that wench.
You codpiece blocked me.
So what if I did?
There's no rule against it.
Well, there should be.
There should be a set of rules<br/>that govern
The way bros comport themselves<br/>among other bros.
But who shall write<br/>such a document?
I have to go to me, d.C.,<br/>and pose for the dollar bill.
And I have to do some<br/>kite-flying or something.
I shall write this set of rules.
And I shall inscribe it<br/>on the back of the constitution.
To save paper.
It's resolved!
Barnabas stinson shall write...
The bro code.
(cheering)
And I shall include a provision
That stateth no eye contact<br/>in a devil's three-way.
Seconded.<br/>Seconded.
Listen, what do you want me for?<br/>I've just been
Losing my mind lately, and do<br/>you know why I feel so bad?
Yeah, because you slept<br/>with robin.
No, that was awesome.
I feel bad
Because the bro code<br/>clearly states
"no sex with your bro's ex."
But if you,
My lawyer,<br/>can find a loophole somewhere,
Then that bad feeling<br/>will go bye-bye.
And you would pay me for that?
No, I'll just be the one<br/>shredding your paperwork.
Technically, you'll be paid<br/>by a toy factory in pyongyang.
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,<br/>but don't you see that this is
Just a desperate way for you
To avoid an unpleasant<br/>confrontation with ted?
Hey, if I wanted<br/>a psychological evaluation,
I'd hire the guy we pay
To hypnotize us<br/>before depositions.
Now, get cracking!
While marshall examined<br/>the bro code,
Lily's kindergarten class<br/>welcomed a special guest.
And with a little luck,<br/>in a few days,
Farmer frank's cold<br/>will be all gone.
And that's why farmer frank's<br/>breath smells like medicine.
Right, farmer frank?
You got it, toots.
Any last questions<br/>for farmer frank? Yes.
Will we ever get<br/>to see missy the goat again?
Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet!
Well, you know, honey,
Right after this,
I'm gonna drop old missy off<br/>at the butcher shop.
And they're going to take
A great big knife...
And frank went on to traumatize<br/>lily's entire class
With a graphic explanation<br/>of where meat comes from.
So not one little scrap<br/>of missy goes to waste.
Ms. Aldrin,<br/>please don't let them eat missy.
I know, I know.
I already called<br/>an animal rescue,
And they're going<br/>to come get her on Monday.
Monday?! Where's she going<br/>to sleep and eat
And go to the bathroom?!
(bleating)
Okay, where's<br/>she going to sleep and eat?
I-I guess<br/>I'll keep her up on the roof.
Look, call me crazy. I just...
I don't think having a goat<br/>in the apartment is a good idea.
And, boy, was I right,<br/>because what missy the goat
Would go on to do<br/>in that bathroom was so...
(bleating) no, you know what?
I'm getting ahead of myself.
We'll get there.
Hey, ted.
Hey.
You ready to, um...
Where'd the goat turd come from?
How'd you know<br/>that was a goat turd?
Well, it was either that,
Or a musk ox turd,<br/>and I figured,
What the hell would a musk ox<br/>be doing in here?
Hey. Guess what<br/>your wife brought home?
Attorney-client privilege.<br/>I can't talk about it.
Talk about what?
Nothing.<br/>(clears throat)
How was your day?
Uh, ooh, goat turd on the floor,<br/>I see. Is that new?
(coughing)
How does everyone know<br/>that's a goat turd?
Barney told you.<br/>I don't know
What you're talking about, madam.<br/>Marshall,
You can't look me in the eye;<br/>you're blushing,
Coughing;<br/>and your hands are shaking.
Hey, robin, come here.
Ted is never finding out<br/>about this, you understand?
Because it never happened,<br/>none of us are saying anything.
And don't even think<br/>about opening that can
Until I'm out<br/>of the splash zone.
(speaking foreign language)
Oh, fantastic, you're here.
Give me the good news.
I'm sorry.
You did too good a job<br/>writing this thing.
It's-it's ironclad.
No!
Bad lawyer!
I need a loophole!
I want to feel better, marshall!
I can't keep buying things!
I have six
Self-cleaning litterboxes
And I don't even have a kid.
Wait. How about this?
Ted's probably
Broken this thing himself,<br/>right?
And if he's broken the bro code,
Then I'm off the hook.
I thought about that.
And I gotta say,
Ted has upheld this thing<br/>time and time again.
For example, article 87:
"a bro shall<br/>at all times say yes."
So he saved you
From an avalanche?
And he carried you six miles<br/>to safety on his broken leg?
Yes.
And you're a pre-op transsexual<br/>nightclub singer
Who used to be a member<br/>of the russian mob?
Da.
Article 29:
"a bro will, in a timely manner,<br/>alert his bro
To the existence<br/>of a girl fight."
Dude, two girls are fighting<br/>at maclaren's.
What?!
Yeah, yeah.
It was crazy.<br/>This one girl was like...
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Article 53:
"a bro will, whenever possible,
Provide his bro<br/>with protection."
That feels nice.
Good.
I just wish we had some wine.
Yeah.
I wish we had some wine, too.
Damn it, marshall.
I'm not paying you to tell me<br/>what a saint ted is!
You're my lawyer!
The answer is in there!<br/>Find it!
Okay, this isn't about<br/>the bro code, and you know it.
The reason that you're upset is<br/>because what you did was wrong.
And the only way<br/>you're ever gonna feel
Any better about it is<br/>if you tell ted what you did.
What if he never wants<br/>to talk to me again?
Well, I guess<br/>that's just a chance
You're gonna have to take.
Which brings us<br/>to April 25, 2008.
My 30th birthday,
Or as it would come to be<br/>referred to in later years:
The day of the goat.
Hey, where are you?
I'm in the limo,<br/>right outside of ted's office.
Great. Well, everyone's here.
Stella just arrived
And there is something here<br/>so awesome,
I'm not going to tell you what<br/>it is, but you won't believe...
Goat in a party hat?
Damn it!
Well, you still gotta see it.
It's so much fun having a goat<br/>at a party!
In a few short hours,
Lily would come<br/>to regret those words.
(bleating)
But we'll get there.
Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.
Okay. Bye.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Whoa, you guys went all out.
Okay, everyone, ted's in the<br/>limo, five-minute warning!
Everyone get ready!
Oh, missy, are you excited?
Yes, you are!
Whoa, we're leaving the city.
Where the hell is this party?
Vegas.
Vegas? I thought the party<br/>was on the rooftop.
Surprise!
Just a decoy, my friend.
So there's no roof party?
Oh, no. There is.<br/>We're just not going.
This is how good a friend I am.
They want you to spend your 30th<br/>standing around
Drinking flat beer ten feet<br/>above your living room.
But not me, bro.
I pulled out all the stops.
Private jet, valderrama suite<br/>at the bellagio.
Steaks at boa,
Scotch at ghostbar,<br/>then two ringside seats
To watch floyd mayweather<br/>go ten rounds with,
Wait for it...
A grizzly bear!
Take me home, barney.
No!
We have to go to vegas.
Look, ted, I didn't want<br/>to say this, but...
There's something<br/>that I have to tell you,
And I wanted you to be
In the best possible frame<br/>of mind before you heard it.
You slept with robin.
(tires screeching)
Ranjit!
You slept with robin?
Barney!
That is ted's ex-girlfriend!
(speaking foreign language)
When did you find out?
Hey, robin. Come here!
What's up?
I was, uh, just going through<br/>some old stuff and I...
(soda can opening)<br/>marshall: Oh, crap!
(sputtering)
Anyway, uh,
I came across this.
Oh, wow.
From our vacation in vermont.<br/>Yeah.
I don't know if you'd even want<br/>it, but if you do, it's yours.
I slept with barney!
What?
It was just one time,
It-it was the night<br/>that simon dumped me
And I was in a really<br/>vulnerable place
And I... I wanted to just<br/>pretend like it never happened,
But I couldn't, and...
I can't.
I just, I had to tell you.
And...
I just hope that we can<br/>still be friends.
Of course we can<br/>still be friends.
So you're not mad?
Well, I'm...
It's a little weird, but, um,
No, I'm not mad.
Wow.
So you're not mad?
No, I'm not mad.
I mean, robin and I broke up<br/>a year ago.
We've... We've both dated lots<br/>of people since then.
I'm with stella now.
Seriously, I...<br/>I'm fine with this.
(sighs)
I'm so relieved<br/>to hear you say that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,
My mom is coming<br/>into town next month.
Maybe you'd like<br/>to nail her, too!
(whispering): Where are they?!<br/>I'm getting a cramp.
(whispering): Marshall,<br/>can we keep the goat?
No.
But she's so cute and<br/>furry and soft. Yeah,
And she also sheds,<br/>eats out of the garbage
And can't control her bowels.
Why don't we just call<br/>duluth mental hospital
And say my uncle linus<br/>can live with us?
Yeah, lily, that may seem<br/>like a good idea
After a couple of drinks<br/>but tomorrow morning
You're going to want this thing<br/>out of your house.
Oh, you should talk.<br/>You slept with barney.
Marshall!
I'm sorry!
I couldn't take it anymore.
I can't believe
You did that.
That's so gross.
Was it amazing?
What? I...
Lily, I really don't want<br/>to talk about this.
I know, but it's barney.
It's just hard<br/>not to be curious.
Did he have like devices and stuff?<br/>Lily, come on.
Hot wax?<br/>Stop it.
Did he tie you to anything?<br/>That's enough.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
(sighs)
Is he all smooth down there?
Three billion women<br/>on the planet!
Three billion!<br/>And you have to sleep
With the one that I dated<br/>for a year! Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?!
Robin?!
You think I'm proud of this?!
I'm horrified<br/>that this happened.
How did it happen? Huh?
Barney, I want to know.
Tell me exactly how it happened.
You mean...
What position?
(grunts) okay.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it.
Hit him! Hit him, ted!<br/>Stop!
Hit him!<br/>Stop!
Hit him!<br/>Okay.
Okay. Okay.
You're pissed.
You deserve to be.
Fine. You know what?
One free shot. On me.
Anywhere but the face.
(grunts) (groans)
Who punches someone<br/>in the groin?
(groaning)
Okay. Okay.
I deserved that.
I deserved that.
But what's important now is...
We're passed this whole<br/>robin thing now, right?
You think that this is just<br/>about robin?
This is about...
You know, I've seen you<br/>do some bad stuff.
I mean some really<br/>terrible stuff
To a lot of different people.
I just always thought<br/>there had to be a limit.
I always thought<br/>I was the limit.
You're always spouting off<br/>these rules for bros.
Isn't one of them,<br/>"don't do this"?
Yeah. And I broke it.
I'm sorry.
But, ted...
Seriously, this suite<br/>at the bellagio...
I am not going to vegas<br/>with you.
I'm not going to blow<br/>off my friends
And my girlfriend,
And spend my 30th birthday<br/>in a strip club.
The fact that you think<br/>I would...
You know, barney,<br/>earlier this week
I started putting<br/>things in a box
And that box was labeled
"stuff I have no<br/>use for anymore."
What does that mean?
It means...
Maybe you belong in that box.
Are you saying you don't want<br/>to be bros anymore?
I'm saying I don't want<br/>to be friends anymore.
Okay, I'm going to stop you<br/>right there,
Because it seems like you're<br/>about to say something
That's going to pretty much<br/>ruin vegas.
Ranjit, stop the car.
(tires screeching)
I'm getting a cab.
♪
All:<br/>Surprise!
(cheering and applause)
Narrator:<br/>Oh, right, the goat.
So funny.<br/>You're going to love this.
So later that night, the goat<br/>locked himself in the bathroom
And was eating one<br/>of robin's washcloths and...
Robin wasn't living here<br/>on my 30th birthday.
When did this happen?
Oh, wait, the goat was there<br/>on my 31st birthday.
Sorry, I totally got that wrong.

[<div class="full-script">Narrator:<br/>Now, kids, the spring of 2008
Was a complicated time<br/>in your old man's life.
The last time I had seen barney<br/>was shortly after I found out
He had spent the night<br/>with robin.
Are you saying you don't want<br/>to be bros anymore?
I'm saying I don't want<br/>to be friends anymore.
(phone rings) (groans)
It's barney.
Dude, seriously, you<br/>need to stop calling me.
Ted, I'm sorry I haven't<br/>returned your calls.
Yeah, I never called you.
You called me 15 times<br/>and my parents twice.
I'm sorry.<br/>I gotta let you go.
There's just too many<br/>good wingmen out there.
Ted, are you crying?
No, I'm not.
Shh, let it out. Let it out.
Shh, let it out.<br/>Good-bye, barney.
So, are you two back together?
No.
I miss barney.
I haven't high-fived anyone<br/>in, like, a week.
I think I might be starting<br/>to lose my fist bump callus.
Let me ask you something, ted.
Why are you so much madder<br/>at barney than me?
Yeah, she had just<br/>as much sex with barney
As barney had with her.
You know what?<br/>I'm not sure that's true.
And I think<br/>I'd actually prefer it
If you were mad at me;<br/>this is too weird.
I'm not mad at anybody.
I-I've forgiven you,
And I've outgrown<br/>barney as a friend.
It's that simple.
I'll tell you why he's not mad.
It's 'cause he's so<br/>happy with stella.
Narrator:<br/>She was right.
Stella and I had been dating<br/>for two months,
And things were going<br/>really well.
She had met my friends<br/>and passed with flying colors.
There was just<br/>one little problem.
You guys haven't had sex yet?!
When marshall and I<br/>were two months in,
We were doing it 24/7.
I know, I was in the top bunk.
I also sat next to you guys<br/>at football games.
So what are you guys<br/>waiting for?
I think she wants to make sure<br/>we're serious first.
That's why she hasn't introduced<br/>me to her daughter, either.
She wants to take things slow.
Wait, so you haven't had sex<br/>since, like, thanksgiving.
Do you know how many<br/>big federal holidays
Have come and gone since then?
Ooh, baby, do you remember<br/>martin luther king day?
Yeah, I do.
We honored that dude big time.
(laughs)
Look, I'm crazy about this girl,
And if waiting is what it takes,<br/>then I am fine with that.
On a totally unrelated note,<br/>does anybody have any gum
Or ice or a piece of bark<br/>they're not chewing?
Hey, barney, new<br/>skymall came in.
So, uh...
Word around the blogosphere
Is that you're looking<br/>for a new wingman.
I want to let you know<br/>I am available.
Just say the word,<br/>or don't even say the word.
Just do something<br/>with your eyebrow.
Was that it?
No offense, randy,<br/>but there's a long list
Of candidates for this slot.
This slot<br/>is vice president of awesome,
And you're, like, assistant<br/>undersecretary of only okay.
"Assistant undersecretary<br/>of only okay."
Thank you. I won't let you down.
Narrator: So uncle barney began<br/>the search for a new wingman.
Pete!<br/>Barney stinson.
Hey, I've been meaning<br/>to call you. It's been a while.
Yeah, yeah, so listen.
You should meet me<br/>at maclaren's tonight.
You're never gonna believe this:<br/>I'm at the hospital.
Just had a baby daughter.
So what do you think,<br/>9:30, 10:00?
Stapleton!<br/>Barney stinson.
What up, chief?
Need a new bro. What do you say?
Dude, I'd love to, but right now<br/>I'm bros with doug stein.
Oh, I understand.
Doug stein's a good bro.
I'm happy for you.<br/>Best of luck.
Crazy willie!<br/>Barney stinson.
What up, b-dog?<br/>Long time, no bro.
So we gonna tear it up<br/>tonight or what?
Yes, finally!
Here's what's<br/>on the rock-it docket.
My wife and I<br/>put the cheese out at 7:00,
Cranium at 8:00,<br/>9:00 p.M. We watch 27 dresses.
Everybody's home by 11:00.<br/>Boo-yah!
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Hanging up on you once<br/>wasn't enough.
(huffing)
So I lanced this thing<br/>on this guy's back,
And I'll be honest with you,<br/>I didn't even know what it was,
And then it exploded<br/>like a volcano.
Pus everywhere.
Let's have sex.
Right now.<br/>I'll lock the door.
Oh, there's no lock<br/>on that door.
We can do it against the door.<br/>It'll be hot!
It'll be like a three-way:<br/>You, me, and the door.
Yeah, but then<br/>it's just gonna be weird
Between me<br/>and the door tomorrow.
(laughs)
I'm sorry.
We're waiting. It's cool.
You've been so patient, ted.
The truth is...
I'm kind of nervous.
I have a confession to make.
I was afraid of this.
You're 14.
(giggles)
No, um...
It's kind of embarrassing,<br/>but it's been a while
Since I was intimate<br/>with anyone.
Wow, it's funny<br/>that you say that.
Me, too.
Really?
How long's it been for you?
It's been a while.
Tell me.
Me, too!
It's been five months<br/>for you, too?
Five years?! Five years?!<br/>Five years?!
Wow.
Stella hasn't had<br/>sex since 2003.
Let's put this in context.
The last time stella had sex,<br/>the movie, seabiscuit,
Had just galloped into<br/>theaters... And our hearts.
Five years?
God, if I even went one year,
I would be out on the street<br/>selling it for a nickel.
The last time stella had sex,
The world was just<br/>learning about sars.
Well, ted, what else<br/>did she say?
Did she give you<br/>any kind of explanation?
Look, after lucy was born,<br/>I dated a little,
But it was hard to find a guy<br/>I could trust enough.
Sooner or later,<br/>every one of them
Gave me a reason not to.
But nobody in five years?
Look, ted, guys regret the girls<br/>they didn't sleep with.
Girls regret the guys<br/>they do sleep with.
And for the past five years,
I've had no regrets.
(sighs)
Ted, you're staring at my boobs.
In my defense,<br/>they were staring at me.
So what does this mean for you?
Is she ever gonna want<br/>to get intimate?
Actually...
But the truth is, I really do
Want to do this with you.
I don't think<br/>I'd regret it at all.
Your pillow talk's<br/>a little rusty.
You know what I mean, ted.<br/>I'm ready.
That's great.
Like, "right now" ready?
(laughs)
So her sister's driving up<br/>to baby-sit lucy,
And we're getting a hotel room<br/>in the city Saturday night.
The last time stella had sex,
The da vinci code<br/>had just come out.
Well, that doesn't seem<br/>like that long ago.
Not the movie, the book.
Wow.
It's a lot of pressure,<br/>isn't it?
You know what?<br/>It's not.
This woman needs it bad.
Anything you do<br/>is going to be fireworks.
I remember my longest drought...
It was that summer I lived<br/>in san francisco.
I hadn't had been with marshall<br/>in two months and 19 days.
(rumbling)
Oh, san francisco.
I don't know, lily,<br/>after five years,
Her expectations<br/>have gotta be pretty high.
Notable deaths in 2003...
Oh, my god...<br/>Nell carter.
Did you guys know<br/>that nell carter had died?
I'm really gonna have to bring<br/>my a-game to satisfy this woman.
Yeah, it'll be pretty hard<br/>now that she's dead.
Not nell carter...<br/>Stella.
Marshall:<br/>Dude, relax.
It's all about<br/>expectations management.
Do you know why I hated<br/>jerry maguire so much?
Because you're dead inside?
No, because you built it<br/>up for, like, two weeks,
Saying it was the<br/>greatest movie ever.
With stella, do the opposite:<br/>Lower expectations.
Right, right, and then<br/>no matter what happens,
She'll be happy.<br/>(cell phone rings)
Hey, buddy.
I'm married, barney.<br/>I cannot be your new wingman.
(cell phone rings)
No.
Hey, randy.
Could you come in here<br/>for a minute?
Good news.
I'm calling you up<br/>to the majors.
Starting tomorrow night,
How would you like<br/>to be my new wingman?
Uh...
Just need to check my calendar.<br/>Be right back.
Tomorrow works.
I have a surprise appetizer<br/>for us today.
Check it out.
Potato skins.
Fancy.
Yeah, right?
God, it's been forever<br/>since I had potato skins.
I remember them as being
Pretty much the most<br/>delicious things ever.
Huh.
That's surprising.
What?
This potato skin.
It's good,<br/>but not nearly as good
As I'd built it up to be<br/>in my head.
Even though this potato skin<br/>performed admirably,
And is a totally<br/>respectable size...
I couldn't enjoy it
Because of my own<br/>unrealistic expectations.
Hmm, ted, I see<br/>what you're doing.
Huh? You're trying to lower
My expectations for tonight.
Is this a length thing?<br/>No.
Quick on the draw?<br/>No.
Unexpected number of testicles?<br/>No!
It's just that this<br/>is a big deal for you.
I mean, it's like<br/>your virginity: The sequel.
(laughs)
Virginity 2: Electric boogaloo?
Exactly, and I don't want<br/>to mess it up.
I don't want you to ever wonder<br/>if I was worth it.
Ted, of course<br/>it's gonna be worth it.
Stop worrying.
It's you and me.
It already has everything<br/>it needs.
"Unexpected number<br/>of testicles?"
It happens.<br/>I knew a guy in med school...
We used to joke that he was one<br/>ball away from getting walked.
(chuckles)
Hey.
What up, bro-seph lieberman?
No, uh-uh.
Randy, we never use<br/>the word "bro" in the name
Of a failed democratic<br/>vice presidential candidate.
Good-bye,<br/>"geraldine ferrar-bro."
You know what?
I'm excited about this, randy.
You will be my next masterpiece.
It's like with ted.
When I first met him,
He was an even bigger loser<br/>than you.
What a loser.
But tonight,<br/>I am going to make you
The greatest wingman<br/>in the history of wingmen.
Oh, well, it's gonna be easier<br/>than you think, bro.
Yeah, I've been reading<br/>your blog for years.
You are like a god to me.
That's why tonight is<br/>going to be legendary...
Wait for it...
Dary.
Oh.
Okay, randy, let's do this.
(under breath):<br/>Okay.
You ready?
Yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What? What's<br/>the matter?
Nothing.
Let's do this.
No, no, no, no, no,<br/>please, please, please.
Just wait. Just wait.<br/>Just wait. Just wait!
Randy, what are you doing?
Dripping with game,<br/>that's what I'm doing.
Okay, let's go. No. Let's...
Yes. No!
Randy, listen to me:<br/>You can do this, okay?
Oh, I don't know.<br/>Are those girls really that hot?
Yeah, they're hot.<br/>Let's do this.
Okay!
Hey, ladies.
Have you met...
(knocking)
Hey.<br/>Hey!
So, here's the plan.
Take a horse-drawn carriage<br/>through the park,
And it just so happens
The philharmonic is playing<br/>an open-air... Ted...
Five years.
Straight to the hotel?<br/>Straight to the hotel.
I'll get my bag.
Hey, guys.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
So, uh, looking forward<br/>to tonight?
Yeah. Definitely.
It's been such a long time<br/>since I've had a night out.
Yeah, we heard.
I would explode<br/>if it had been that long
Since I had<br/>a "night out."
This one wakes me up
At 4:00 a.M. Sometimes
Just to have a little<br/>"night out."
Um, what are you guys<br/>talking about?
Nothing.
Pizza.
What are you talking about?
Hey, guys.
Ted, you told them, didn't you?
Told them what?
You told them
That I haven't had<br/>sex in five years.
You haven't had sex<br/>in five years?!
That is a shocking revelation
That we're just finding out<br/>about right now.
Stella, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have told them.
But they're my best friends.<br/>I tell them everything.
I-I didn't even think about it.
Ted, that was so personal.
Plus, now your friends<br/>think I'm a freak.
No, they don't.
Look, I realize<br/>it's weird, okay?
Not many people go five years<br/>without having sex.
13 years?!
I peaked really young.
That's why it was difficult<br/>for me to tell you.
But I did tell you because I<br/>thought that I could trust you.
You c trust me.
Obviously, I can't.
You know, there's always a<br/>reason not to sleep with a guy,
And you just gave me yours.
Wait, did I give you a reason,
Or were you looking for one?
Why would I be looking for one?
Because things are getting<br/>serious between us,
And that scares you.
Good night, ted.
(door slams)
Okay, randy, now,
Tell me, without looking<br/>at your hand,
What are the three<br/>beginner techniques
For picking up a woman at a bar?
Isolate her from her friends;
Repeat her name in conversation;
Subtly put her down.
Excellent.
Now... Let's put those to use.
I'm right behind you.
Hi, I'm randy.
What's your name?
Haley.
Haley.
Haley, that's a pretty name,<br/>haley.
Haley...
Come here, haley.
Um... Okay.
Haley, you are<br/>a fat, ugly whore.
I'm sorry, barney.
Eh, so you got a drink<br/>thrown in your face.
Happens to me all the time.
Pretty soon you'll be<br/>able to anticipate it,
And when you do?<br/>Free drink.
Oh, hey.
We got two live ones.
New plan: This time<br/>follow my lead.
Evening, ladies.
Oh, I like your brooch.
What is that?
Oh, it's a koala bear.
I think they're adorable.
No way!
My friend randy here<br/>is the leading expert
On koala bears in australia!
He's in town working<br/>with the bronx zoo.
You are?
That is so cool!
What is your favorite thing<br/>about koala bears?
Their...
Meat is delicious.
I'm sorry, barney.
Ah, it's okay.
New plan:
We need to get you comfortable
Just saying words to women.
Now, there's no reason<br/>to be nervous,
Because my friend, robin,<br/>has agreed to help out.
Because you threatened to put a<br/>video of us on the internet,
Which I'm still not<br/>convinced you have.
Right, which is why<br/>you came all the way
From brooklyn at midnight.
Now, randy,
Let's keep it simple.
Just start by introducing<br/>yourself.
Hi.
My name is randy.
Hi, randy.
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
Good, thank you.<br/>Great.
You're doing really,<br/>really well.
Now ask her<br/>what she's doing later.
What are you doing later?
Yeah, your nose is bleeding<br/>like a faucet.
Oh, god.
This happens every time<br/>I get an erection.
I am so sorry.
(sighs) okay.
Okay, new plan.
We wrap his face in gauze<br/>so he can't bleed or talk.
You are the woman...
Barney, why are you so desperate<br/>to have this happen?
I'm a wingman.
That's what wingmen do.
Is it possible
That you're trying to fill<br/>the void of losing ted
By rushing into a new wingman<br/>relationship?
What are you saying?
I'm saying that randy<br/>is your rebound bro.
No.
That's crazy.
What randy and I have is real.
No, it's not, barney.
And even if you got randy laid<br/>tonight,
Would it feel<br/>anywhere near as meaningful
As when you got ted laid?
He was just so happy<br/>the next morning, you know?
I know.
All right.
It hasn't clotted,
But I think it's pretty much<br/>draining backwards now.
Randy...
I've been thinking,
This isn't working out.
Yeah, I figured.
I knew I couldn't fly<br/>this close to the sun
Without getting burned.
This is the story of my life.
I always let people down.
You, my dad, the chief.
The chief?
Yeah, I was a cop<br/>for, like, three months.
But I got kicked off the force
Because I screwed up so much,<br/>I was an insurance liability.
You were a new york<br/>city police officer,
And you didn't tell me?
Wow!
Did you ever shoot anybody?
Only all the time.
But not himself.
And not in the foot.
Actually... Ah,<br/>bah, bah, bah, bah.
But nothing.
I don't think there's anything<br/>hotter than a cop.
Are you okay?
Your nose is bleeding.
Uh, old injury.
The bullet's still<br/>lodged in his sinus.
Oh, my god!
You know what?
I live right around the corner.
Can I take you to my place
And fix you up?
That would be very nice.
Yes.
Have a great time, you two.
(whispering): Oh, my god, thank you.<br/>I can't thank you enough.
I am the greatest wingman<br/>of all time.
Ted doesn't know<br/>what he's missing.
(voice cracking): You had<br/>to mention ted, didn't you?
(knocking)
Okay, I really overreacted<br/>last night.
I'm sorry.
(sighs) maybe I have<br/>some trust issues,
But believe me,<br/>I have earned them.
You said that I was<br/>looking for a reason
For this whole thing<br/>to fall apart.
Well, you're onto me, ted.
That's actually something<br/>that I do a lot.
But I'm not going<br/>to do that with you.
Ted... I'm in.
This is awkward.
I have a girl here.
So...
Come on.
There is something that<br/>I'm ready to do with you.

Was going to take a big step<br/>that weekend.
Turned out, it took<br/>an even bigger one.
She's sound asleep.<br/>Oh.
She is so great.
I think so.
So, uh, I was thinking,
My sister is in town<br/>until tomorrow.

[<div class="full-script">Narrator:<br/>Kids, in the spring of 2008,
Something kinda strange<br/>had been happening
To your uncle barney.
He'd be doing great<br/>with a woman...
So I throw the pressurized<br/>oxygen tank in his mouth,
I shoot the tank, boom!
No more shark.
Mr. Holland and I swim<br/>back to shore.
Let me freshen your drink.
He'd only be gone a few moments,
But when he returned...
So where were we?
He'd get slapped.
It kept happening.
Jerk!
Until finally,<br/>lily was approached
By a mysterious woman
Who warned her<br/>to stay away from barney.
So when it happened once more...
Again?!
Really?! Wait...
Barney knew who to look for.
Hey, hey.
Hey, excuse me.
Did I sleep with you and<br/>then totally screw you over?
No.
What are you doing on Friday?

Hey!
Uh... No.
Stop!

Amy?
Abby.
Right.
Narrator: Kids, sometimes<br/>you can do something right
A thousand times in a row...
A rainbow!
That's beautiful!
What a beautiful
Rainbow!
Another rainbow?
It's beautiful!
But then, that<br/>thousand-and-first time...
You're kidding me.
Seriously, aren't you<br/>sick of these things?
Uh-oh.
Hey, how was your day?
Today, I yelled at a little girl<br/>for painting a rainbow.
A rainbow?
Sounds like that bitch<br/>had it coming.
Hey.
So, uh, I just met<br/>with the contractor.
And it turns out,
That fixing the floors<br/>of the new apartment
Is going to cost a lot more<br/>than the estimate.
But we can barely afford that<br/>to begin with.
I hate to say this,
But I think you're going to have<br/>to sell your stuff.
Whoa! Marshall,
That's just a game we play<br/>in the bedroom.
I mean your clothes.
All those designer pieces<br/>and everything.
What?
Why just my clothes?
We can sell my stuff, too,
But I got to tell you,
I think your marc jacobs<br/>cocktail dress
Is going to go for a lot more
Than my "split happens"<br/>bowling shirt.
Dude. (whispering):<br/>I'm not selling that.
I've already made the website.
You made a website?
Yeah, it's called
"lily-and-marshall-sell-<br/>their-stuff-dot-com."
No, you know what would be<br/>a better name for the site?
Guy-forces-his-wife-<br/>to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag-
For-the-next-<br/>three-years-dot-com.
Whoa.
That's real.
My word.
That woman is actually wearing<br/>a-a garbage bag.
Hmm, but, girlfriend,
You cannot pull off<br/>a tall kitchen.
Why are you trying<br/>to ruin my life?
Well, you slept with me and<br/>then you never called me again.
And?
That's it.
That's it?
As far as I'm concerned,
If I leave you safe on dry land
With adequate<br/>transportation home,
You've got nothing<br/>to complain about.
Well, it hurt, okay?
And then ted,<br/>the love of my life,
Started dating my boss<br/>instead of me.
Do you know how that feels?
Oh, boo-hoo, poor little ashley.
Abby!<br/>Abby.
A few weeks ago,
Ted dumped me as his wingman.
You had a crush on him<br/>for a couple weeks?
I was ted's best friend<br/>for seven years.
Ted said marshall<br/>was his best friend.
Seven years!
Sorry.
Ted.
What an idiot.
With his stupid
"meaningful relationship"<br/>with stella.
Ted.
Ted.
I hate ted.
I hate ted more.
Are you as turned on as I am?
Probably not quite as much.
(sighs)
I'm sorry<br/>I yelled out "ted."
I'm sorry<br/>I yelled out "abby."
I am abby.
Oh, cool.
This is insane.
Has lily even worn<br/>half this stuff?
Oh, yeah, like there's nothing<br/>in your closet

Whatever, red cowboy boots.<br/>Hey,
Those are nice boots.
I totally pull those off.
Hey, lil,

"ted could never pull them off."
What would I be talking about?<br/>His red cowboy boots.
I totally pull them off!

Listen, we really<br/>need the money.

That kind of money only goes<br/>for real paintings.
Uh-oh.
What does that mean?
Look, it just, it just means
That-that we need money<br/>right now
And I'm not sure that<br/>selling your paintings
Is-is how we're going<br/>to get it.
You don't believe in me.
What?<br/>No, wait, wait!
Of c...
Of course I believe in you!
Marshall, I am proud of my work<br/>as an artist.
My paintings are good.
I bet robin would buy one.
What now?
I love your painting,
I just... I'm trying<br/>to be realistic.
Well, how much money do we need
For the contractor<br/>to finish the job?
About 1,500 bucks.
So, if I sell three of my<br/>paintings at 500 bucks a pop,
Then I get to keep<br/>all my clothes.
We need money fast.
Well, give me a week.
(sighs)
Okay, a-a week.
Fine.<br/>Fine.
Fine.
Pulling.
Them.
Off.
Lily's first move in the<br/>great art challenge of 2008
Was to display one<br/>of her favorite paintings
At her friend's gallery.
The night didn't go so well.
♪ I'm just a painter
♪ I do my crappy art
♪ but I see what's in your eyes<br/>and I know... ♪
But then at the last minute...
I love it.
Your top. It's gorgeous.
Is that 100% silk?
It's not for sale!<br/>My clothes are not for sale!
So the next day,
Lily took her painting<br/>to a coffee house
That displayed local artists.
We've been sitting<br/>here for hours
And nobody's even glanced<br/>at my painting.
Come on.
Let's start talking it up.
Wow!
I really like that painting!
It's neat!
The-the colors are neat.
The-the shapes<br/>are neat.
It's really just...
Neat.
What?
Observe.<br/>(clears throat)
I think there's a dynamic<br/>quality to the brushwork
That, combined with the<br/>fluid composition,
Creates an almost kandinsky-like<br/>emotional resonance.
Yes, and you can still enjoy it
Even if you're not<br/>a pretentious douche.
Can you clarify something for me<br/>about your critique?
Are the colors "neat" or are<br/>they more "neato burrito?"
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Uh, then again,<br/>red cowboy boots.
I pull these off!
(all laugh)
I pull these off!
You know what I hate<br/>most about ted?
What?
His stupid hair.
His stupid, lame awesome hair.
It's so stupid and awesome.
You know what I hate most about ted?<br/>What?
How he's always, like,
"oh, I want to fall in love<br/>and have a relationship.
I care about the people<br/>I have sex with."
He's so lame.
He's so lame and awesome.
You know what he needs?
He needs
To see just how horrible he is
When he's in a relationship.
Yeah, and I need to show<br/>ted that I'm over him.
Are you thinking<br/>what I'm thinking?
I think so.
You're thinking of<br/>having sex with ted?
After four days without<br/>selling a single painting,
Lily was getting desperate.
Painting for sale!
$500!
Lifelong dream hanging<br/>in the balance!
It's like
They don't even see us.
Yeah, we're dirt to them.
What do you need money for?
Oh, I'm trying to fix<br/>the hardwood floors
In my new apartment.
You?
Heroin.
Oh.
Do you like heroin?
Love it.
In fact, if you sell that,
I'm going to take your money<br/>and go buy some more heroin.
Thanks for your honesty,<br/>crazy sock guy.
Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...
It's not very good.
And just as she was about<br/>to lose all hope,
Something amazing happened.
Oh, my god!
Ha!
500 bucks!
Who's a real painter now,<br/>marshall?
Honey, I never said<br/>you weren't a real painter.
Oh, I know, sweetie.
And since I'm<br/>a professional artist now,
I'm going to sketch you<br/>an aldrin original,
You know, to say thanks
For being such<br/>a supportive husband.
I'm thinking about calling it...
"suck it!"
Lily, come on.
I'm proud of you.
Who-who bought it?
Well, that's the best part.
A gay couple without kids.
A g-cwok!
You bagged<br/>a g-cwok?!
Yeah, that's right.
They are the heart and soul<br/>of the art-buying community.
You know what you should do?
You should call<br/>up the g-cwoks
And offer them a free painting
If they throw a<br/>private art party
For all their<br/>g-cwok friends.
That's an amazing idea.
I'm going to go call them.
(gasping): I can probably sell two<br/>more paintings with time to spare.
Oh, wait, marshall.
There was something<br/>I had to tell you.
What was it?
Oh, that's right.
(singsongy):<br/>Suck it.
Hey.
Ted, fancy bumping<br/>into you here.
Have you guys met<br/>my girlfriend abby?
Uh, yeah.
Hi, abby.<br/>Hello,
Abby.<br/>So, uh,
S-so you guys are dating now?
That's right.
I am done with this whole<br/>being awesome thing.
Now I'm all about<br/>farmers' markets
And day hikes in matching<br/>khaki cargo shorts.
Isn't that right, sweetie?
That's right.
Girlfriends are lame.
Unless they're me.
I miss you, ted.
Barney:<br/>Abby and I
Are in love.
Not hot passionate love.
Couple love.
You know, movie night<br/>with my girlfriend,
Then waiting<br/>for her to go to bed
So I can steal one pitiful<br/>moment of hollow ecstasy
By the cold, blue light<br/>of my computer monitor.
We're showing ted<br/>how lame he is.
You don't have<br/>to say it, though.
Uh, okay, barney, you can stop.
Stop what, ted?
Stop being in love?
Next he'll ask us<br/>to stop breathing.
(both laughing)
We can't stop breathing, ted.
Your hair looks amazing.
Um, barney,<br/>I, I see what you're doing.
Please stop.
Not before I share with you
What being in a relationship<br/>leads to, ted.
Abby,
Pookie bear...
I am so pathetically desperate<br/>for you that...
Aw, heck, I'll just say it.
Will you marry me?
(gasping):<br/>Wait, really?
I would never joke<br/>about true love.
Yes, I'll marry you.
Okay.<br/>(applause)
(laughing)
Thank you, thank you.
I have to call my mom.
(laughs)
That's you.
Uh, yeah, I don't think<br/>abby knows you're kidding.
Uh, yes, she does.
It finally happened, mama.
I just wish daddy were alive<br/>to walk me down the aisle.
Totally committed to the bit.
Yes, lily aldrin.
I sold you the painting<br/>earlier today.
Oh, honey, hello.
You sound happy.
Are you kidding? We're popping<br/>the champagne right now.
Well, I just wanted to offer you<br/>an exclusive chance
To view some<br/>of my other paintings.
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh,<br/>I guess I should have told you.
We just bought that<br/>for the frame.
What?
Yeah, it's an original<br/>anton kreutzer,
A very rare frame<br/>from the turn of the century.
So... Y-you didn't like<br/>my painting?
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie,<br/>no, not at all.
But you know,
Good for you.
Okay.
Wow.
Well, if you didn't want<br/>the painting, can I...
Can I at least get it back?
Yeah, no,<br/>we don't have it anymore.
Where is it?
(inhales sharply)
I see.
H-he threw out my painting.
Champagne for everyone on me,
The happiest guy in the world.
(cheering)
Ginger ale.<br/>It's a bit.
This is great.
My dream of becoming<br/>an artist is dead,
And now I'm watching<br/>my wardrobe disappear
Piece by piece.
(chimes)
There goes my favorite dress.
This dress meant a lot to me.
Really?
It was spring of 2004 and I had<br/>been having a hard few months.
Day-am.
I got a two-syllable "damn"<br/>in this dress.
A two-syllable "damn."
That's the dream.<br/>Yeah.
Now she belongs to...
It's still in the family.
Lily,
You're not going<br/>to believe this.
Something amazing happened.<br/>What?
I went<br/>to the g-cwok's apartment.
Really? Why?
Because I felt guilty.
This auction was my idea
And now you've had<br/>to sit around all day
While a bunch of vultures<br/>ruthlessly pick apart
The carcass of your wardrobe.
It's still in the family.
And more importantly,
I honestly love that painting
And I couldn't stand<br/>to think of it
In a trashcan someplace.
Well, what happened?
Well, hello.
Hi, um... Lawrence.
I-I'm here about the painting<br/>my wife lily sold you...
The one in the nice frame.
Talk about a nice frame.
My, my, you are a<br/>big one, aren't you?
And you're married to that<br/>little bit of a thing.
How does that work?
I'd like to find out.
Yeah, we get it.
Gay guys like you.
No, lily, they love me,
But that's not<br/>the important part.
Here's the important part.
Since you're clearly a man
Of impeccable taste and style,
I-I came down here<br/>to ask you:
What do you think of the boots?
Walter.
Boots.
Pulling.
Them.
Off.
I'll be in the cab.
G-cwok-approved.
The painting.
Right, so, um,<br/>they told me they threw it
In the building's dumpster.
It wasn't in there,
But the super told me<br/>that he'd seen one dr. Greer...
A veterinarian<br/>who works in the building...
Take the painting<br/>out of the trash.
Dr. Greer?
Who's dr. Greer a-and<br/>why did he take my painting?
You're about to find out.
Long story short, I had<br/>to make a trash run.
Been a busy day...<br/>Lots of neuterings.
Ooh, we don't need the details.
Oh, n-n-no,<br/>it's not what you think.
Oh, thank god. Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br/>mostly just dog testicles.
Anyway...
I noticed your painting
Just sitting right there on top
And I thought,<br/>"hey, free painting,"
So I brought it upstairs
And hung it up in exam room 3,
And then<br/>the strangest thing happened.
Hey, muffin.
(dog growling)
Whoa, I think he remembers me
From the last time he was here.
(barks)
Take muffin to exam room 3.
I'll meet you there.
I went in, expecting the worst.
I'd never seen muffin that calm,
And then a little later<br/>the same thing happened again
With tidbit...
And king larry...
And again<br/>with the weinstein triplets.
Something about your art speaks<br/>to the canine sensibility
On a very primal level.
Really?
Dogs like my paintings?
Yeah.
But you know who it bums out?
Birds.
Yeah.
Had a parrot in there today.
He took one look at it,<br/>pried open his cage,
Flew right into the ceiling fan.
Anyway, because your<br/>first painting worked so well,
I convinced dr. Greer<br/>to buy four more.
Really?<br/>Mm-hmm, at $500 apiece.
(gasping):<br/>That's two grand.
That's more than we need<br/>for the contractor.
Yeah, but I was actually<br/>thinking we could reinvest it.
In what?<br/>In you.
♪ Don't give up on your dreams,<br/>boy ♪
Narrator: Marshall explained that he<br/>was building a fancy new web site
Specifically to sell lily's<br/>artwork to veterinarians.
Well, it's not<br/>exactly the clientele
I had in mind, but...
Thank you for believing in me.
(wings flapping, bird squawking)
(thuds)
Man, birds do not get you.
(knocking)
Hi, sweetie.<br/>Hey,
I think I left my tie here.<br/>Have you seen it?
No, I'm in<br/>wedding-planning mode.
Stressville.<br/>Population: Me.
Okay, big decision.
What do you think<br/>the cake should be:
Fudgie the whale or cookie puss?
Yeah, that was a bit.
We were doing a bit.
So I'm thinking labor day.
I was going to say<br/>fourth of July,
But I didn't want to steal any<br/>attention away from america.
Abby, I've...<br/>I've got some bad news.
I can't marry you.<br/>What?
Ted begged me not to.
I think he's in love with you.
Yes, our plan worked<br/>better than we ever dreamed.
You have to go to him.
Here's his home address.
But you know what?<br/>He works late,
So I wouldn't go before 2:00<br/>or 3:00 in the morning.
Oh, my god, thank you.
But now I feel wrong<br/>keeping this.
Oh, yeah,<br/>I wouldn't worry about that.
That's made of candy.
Later.

[<div class="full-script">Narrator: Kids, this is<br/>the story of the cab ride
That changed my life.
I know it sounds crazy,<br/>but for all I know
My life would be very different<br/>if I had taken, say...
That cab.
Or that cab.
God knows<br/>what would have happened
If I had gotten into that cab.
I took this cab.
And it changed my whole life.
But first, we need<br/>to back up a little.
Hey.
Is there any beer in the fridge?
It's 10:00 in<br/>the morning.
Grab me one.
So,
Something bad just happened.
Stella and I were out<br/>having breakfast.
So, my sister broke up<br/>with her boyfriend.
Well, I can finally say it.
I hated that guy!
Everything out of his mouth is,
"I'm a vegan.
"Fish feel pain.
I'm never constipated."
The guy's an idiot.
Actually, she's marrying him.
I just wanted<br/>your honest opinion.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I think there's a wisdom to...
Anyway, they picked<br/>a date, so, uh,
You want to come with me,
So that we can laugh<br/>our asses off
As we watch him walk<br/>barefoot down the aisle
In a hemp tuxedo?
Yeah, sure. When is it?
Uh, first weekend in November.
Is that
The something bad?
That she invited you<br/>to a wedding?
Six months from now.
As in we'll be together<br/>six months from now.
Do you guys remember
Barney's whole thing<br/>about making plans
In a relationship?
Fourth row.
Ted, no.
You're violating<br/>the date-time continuum.
You never make
Plans with a girl further<br/>in the future
Than the amount of time<br/>you've been going out.
You've been dating this girl<br/>for, what, two weeks?
No, you're not taking her to a<br/>springsteen concert in January.
By that time you won't even<br/>remember this robin girl's name.
Ugh, man, I love springsteen!
He's like the american<br/>bryan adams.
Well...
But
Barney had a point.
As soon as she started talking<br/>about the wedding,
It freaked me out.
Oh, that sounds<br/>like so much fun.
Mmm. So I get to<br/>look forward to it
For six months.
Which is twice as long<br/>as we've been dating.
Uh-oh.
I'm sure<br/>your daughter lucy'll come
So it'll be like a...<br/>A family trip.
Our first trip<br/>as our funny little family.
So that... That'll<br/>be super-exciting.
Oh, boy.
Man, they crank up the heat<br/>in these places.
What's going on, ted?
We need to talk.
Oh. Oh. Oh.
"We need to talk"?
There's only two situations<br/>where you say that to someone
And unless you're pregnant,
It sounds like you<br/>broke up with her.
Yeah, I did.
(gasping)
So how did she take it?
Um...
I'm only trying<br/>to be honest with you.
You know, ted.<br/>I have to go to work.
Stella, can we just...
I don't want to leave it<br/>like this.
No, ted, it's okay.
We're good.
Ow!
Look, I know it sounds rough,
But stella's a mom.
I have to be responsible.
If I'm having these
Feelings now,<br/>what if they don't go away?
What if they just get worse<br/>and worse
And six months from now,<br/>I break up with her
Over tofu salmon<br/>at her sister's wedding?
I can't do that
To her.<br/>And I definitely can't do that
To her daughter.
It sucks, but I'm being<br/>the good guy here.
This is the right decision.
Which brings me back<br/>to the cab ride.
Hello, may I speak<br/>with marshall eriksen?

♪
Hey, guys.
Jell-o?
I can't believe this.<br/>So you're totally fine.
No, I'm not fine.
I made the biggest mistake<br/>of my life.
I want stella back.
I've left her like ten messages,<br/>but her phone's off.
She's at that
Arcade kiddie funland<br/>with her daughter.
Please.
Let me go to kiddie funland.
You can say that<br/>all you want, buddy,
But you're not getting<br/>any morphine.
No, I'm serious.<br/>I got to get out of here.
You're not going anywhere<br/>until we get the tests back.
You could have<br/>internal bleeding.
Your brain could be all full<br/>of blood.
Think that's good for it?
It ain't.
This sucks.
This sucks.
This sucks. This sucks.<br/>Are you...
Are you kidding me?
You walked away
From a car accident<br/>without a scratch.
A miracle took place today.
Oh, here we go.
You don't think<br/>this was a miracle?
There's no such thing<br/>as miracles.
March 2006, maclaren's bar.
Oh.
That's terrible.<br/>Gentle.
That's in!<br/>Gentle.
Ow.<br/>Here we go.
Hey!
Bravo.
Cheers...
Mm-hmm.
(whimpering)
No... Way.
That did not just happen.
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
Miracle!
A pencil went up barney's nose,
And you call it a miracle.
Well, do you have a better<br/>explanation for it?
A drunk jackass<br/>with a box of pencils?
A drunk jackass<br/>called "god!"
And a box of pencils<br/>called "destiny!"
Speaking of barney,<br/>I should give him a call.
Why? We're not friends anymore.
You'd want to know if<br/>this happened to him.
(phone ringing)
Go for barney.
Hey, barney.
Listen, I have something<br/>to tell you.
Oh, boy, here we go.
I've been waiting for this one.
You talked to robin.
She told you<br/>what's under the hood
And you want to take it<br/>for a spin yourself.
Not even if you boiled it<br/>in detergent.
It's about ted.
Ted?
(chuckles)
My former best friend ted
Who I asked you never<br/>to mention to me again?
Yeah.
He's been in a car accident.
He's at saint anthony's<br/>hospital.
Everything's...
No, I understand.
You've got that important thing.
Okay.
Oh, of course
I'll tell him you love him.
Okay.
Suit up!
He is always saying stuff<br/>like that!
He hung up, didn't he?<br/>Yeah.
See, I told you.<br/>We're not friends anymore.
(speaking Korean)
What did he say?
Ah, a hundred and thir... What?
You...
I'm coming, ted.
So, what made you change<br/>your mind about stella?
Well, I was in the cab,<br/>and the car was coming at me,
And you know how they say<br/>that your whole life flashes
Before your eyes<br/>in a near-death experience?
It doesn't.
You don't see everything.
Just the things you love.
(glass shattering) (crashing)
I realized in that moment
That stella is the most<br/>important thing in my life
And-and I have to get her back.
Aw!
Miracle!
Very sweet.
Very romantic.
Not a miracle.

Hey, guys.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

Handle what?

Involve dry-humping, so.
April 2008.
Lily's kindergarten classroom.
You're gonna go in there
And beg for your old job back?
That's crazy.
You hated it there.
I-I know, the job market is<br/>just really bad right now.
Hey, kids,
Who wants uncle marshall<br/>to get his old job back?
(cheering)
They'll cheer
For anything<br/>if you say it like that.
Kids, a super tanker
Spilled five million<br/>gallons of oil
Off the coast of alaska<br/>this morning!
(cheering)
Bob hewitt:<br/>Hello, marshall.
Mr. Hewitt,
I came here to apologize.
I'm going to go<br/>grab some more glue.
Will you watch them for a sec?
Of course.
Leaving nicholson, hewitt,<br/>and west was a huge mistake,
And I can see that now.
So...
Who wants to see the big guy
Put on these tiny hats?
(cheering)
My behavior was disrespectful.
It was unprofessional.
I'm a pilgrim.
I know it looks like<br/>I have a tiny hat,
But in reality, I have<br/>an abnormally large head!
(all laughing)
I was going through<br/>a stressful time.
I wasn't getting enough sleep.
Fourscore and seven years ago,
I had a great, big giant head!
(laughing)
I had just bought an apartment,
And there were some problems.
I-I don't want to bore you<br/>with the details.
I only regret that I have<br/>but one giant head
To give for my country.
(all laughing)
Sir, if you could just see<br/>your way into giving me
One more chance, I promise...<br/>Marshall.
I'm willing to give this<br/>a second chance.
I remember my
First years as an attorney.
Why, I don't know how<br/>many hours I spent.
I don't think I ever left...
(thinking):<br/>Oh, my god! Lice.
I have lice.
Those little bastards<br/>gave me lice.
God, it itches.
Don't scratch it.
You'll look like a fool.
You'll never get your job back.
Okay, you can scratch,<br/>but just make it subtle.
Okay, that's not working.
Oh, sweet, sharp corner<br/>of the desk,
How I long to rub<br/>my infested scalp against you.
I was, um... Just, uh...
You okay, eriksen?
Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.
I am good.
Continue.
Mind over matter.
There are no lice in my hair...
Laying eggs,
Burrowing into my scalp,
Eating their way all the way<br/>down to my brain!
I have lice!
"Lice"?! Lice! Get out!
Get out of my office!
We've got lice!
Everybody out of the building.
If it weren't for the lice,
I would have gotten my job back,
And I would have been<br/>working there when,
Two weeks later, the securities<br/>and exchange commission
Came a-knocking.
God sent those lice to my head
Like he sent<br/>the locusts to egypt:
To liberate me<br/>from corporate bondage.
Miracle.
Hey, guys.
Oh, I'm just so glad
You and ted are back together.<br/>Yeah.
Wait, um, what do you mean<br/>"back together"?
Well, you know,<br/>since you guys broke up.
What? Oh, no.
It was just a small fight.
That wasn't a breakup.
Was that a breakup?<br/>Did he think that was a breakup?
What?
Son of a bitch!
That was a breakup. Wasn't it?
You broke up with me.
Yeah.
I didn't know that<br/>that was a breakup.
Are you kidding?
I-I said, "I feel awful."
You said, "we're good."
Then you got up and left.
Yeah, I said, "we're good,"
As in "we're good."
Like when the waiter<br/>comes around and asks
If you want any more muffins,<br/>and you say, "we're good."
Exactly, and I took<br/>that "we're good" to mean
You didn't want any more
Metaphorical<br/>relationship muffins.
This is crazy.
Forget about all that.
That was a whole<br/>life-changing car accident ago.
I love you.
I don't want to break up.
But you did.
You did want to.
And if you had<br/>those feelings once,
Then you're going<br/>to have those feelings again,
And you're going<br/>to keep on having them.
And I can't count<br/>on that car to hit you
Every time you do.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
You wanted your breakup,
You got it.
What?! Stella, wait!
No, you know what, ted?
We're good.
So you broke up with her<br/>and she didn't know it?
Apparently.
And you actually said,<br/>"I want to break up"?
No, of course not.
Who says "I want to break up"?
That's a horrible thing to say.
Well, that's true.

You know what I'm talking about.
Up top!
Hup!
Are you sure?
Yeah, dude. Why do you think<br/>I had them set it this way?
Okay.
Ow!
Worth it.
(groans)
Barney, you, uh...
You could've died.
Ted, I'm sorry<br/>I broke the bro code.
No, I'm-I'm sorry.
Ted, can we be friends again?
Barney, come on, we're...<br/>We're more than friends.
We're brothers.
You're my brother, ted.<br/>You're my
Brother, barney.
(chuckling)
Did you hear that, marshall?
We're brothers now.
Marshall's my brother, too.
We're all brothers.
Yeah, but I'm your<br/>best brother, right?
And that's how your uncle barney
It got pretty mushy<br/>and embarrassing after that.
Let's skip ahead.
I had to look away<br/>because if I watched
What the paramedics<br/>were about to do,
I would have passed out.
Then they took out this
Electric blade thing<br/>and I kept thinking,
"this isn't happening.<br/>This isn't happening."
Oh, my god.<br/>What did they cut?
My suit.
My beautiful suit.
But you're alive,<br/>and, and ted's alive.
This is amazing!
Two miracles in one day.
(blows raspberry)
What is the matter with you?
How can you possibly<br/>be this cynical?!
You want to know?<br/>Yeah.
You really want to know?<br/>Yeah!
Fine.
When I was a kid,
I had this dog, sir scratchawan.
(chuckles)
Anyway, sir scratchawan<br/>got really old,
So my parents decided<br/>to put him down.
It was the toughest day<br/>of my young life.
Good-bye, sir scratchawan.
I love you.
And when they took<br/>him to the vet,
He told them that<br/>earlier that very day,
He had learned about<br/>an experimental procedure
Called a canine/testudine<br/>cerebro-xenograft.
Ever heard of it?
No.
Well, it saved<br/>sir scratchawan's life.
He lived another seven years.
Miracle.<br/>Except for one...
Kind of big side effect<br/>from the surgery.
Sir scratchawan!
Welcome home!
He turned into a turtle.
I know. It's weird, right?
Apparently, a very common<br/>complication
From canine/testudine<br/>cerebro-xenografts.
And he didn't seem to remember<br/>any of his old tricks.
Go get it, scratchy.
Go get it!
Go get it! Get it!
Go get it, scratchy.
Go get it.
How long was it before...?
Longer than I'm proud of, lily.
Longer than I'm proud of.
And that's when I realized
Miracles ain't real.
Excuse me.
(barney snickers)
Mosby, you're still here?
Your tests came back,<br/>like, an hour ago. You're fine.
Are you kidding me?<br/>Why didn't you tell me?!
I'm sorry.
I guess it was rude of me<br/>to keep resuscitating that guy
With a rake sticking out<br/>of his chest.
Um, I have to go right now.<br/>Barney, I...
Go.
Run, ted. Run.
If there's anything I've taught<br/>you over the years, it's...
Barney, he left.<br/>Oh.
Hey, ted said that right<br/>before the accident,
His life flashed<br/>before his eyes.
You know,<br/>all the stuff he loves.
Did that happen to you?<br/>Oh, yeah.
I know what he saw: Boobs.<br/>Scotch.
And money.
Suits.<br/>A suit of money.
A suit of boobs.
A giant boob wearing<br/>a suit of money.
And the boob is<br/>lactating scotch.
I guess that's pretty much<br/>everything you love, right?
Yeah, pretty much.
Narrator: Kids, a lot<br/>of weird, random things
Have happened in my life,
But that car accident<br/>is one of the few
That I'd call a miracle,<br/>not because of what happened,
But because<br/>of what happened next.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I talk to you?
Okay.
I got you this orange kangaroo.
Uh... Thanks.
So I've been thinking<br/>about what changed
From the moment<br/>I broke up with you
To the moment I knew<br/>I wanted you back.
And, um, I think I finally<br/>figured out what happened.
Your cab got t-boned<br/>by a jackass on a cell phone?
No. I changed.
I'm ready to give you<br/>what you need.
That's why I spent
Ten minutes on the<br/>damn claw machine
Trying to get the big,<br/>fake diamond ring.
But all I could get was<br/>this orange kangaroo.
Diamond ring?
Will you marry me?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, there is something<br/>I wish my dad told me.
The longest pause<br/>you will ever experience in your life
is the one that follows<br/>asking the question...
Will you marry me?
Your brain goes into overdrive,<br/>imaging every possible response.
No.
Oh, God, no.
You want me to marry...
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.
Mark Johnson,
the quarterback from your high school<br/>football team, already asked me.
What's up, Turd?
It's Ted!
But if you're lucky,
she may answer with the single<br/>greatest word in the English language.
Yes.

Stella and I spent that summer<br/>happily engaged.
Marshall was still coping<br/>with unemployment.
What are you doing?
Lily threw herself<br/>into her painting.
What are you doing?
Barney was rehabilitating<br/>from his bus accident.
What are you doing?
And well, Marshall just kept coping<br/>with unemployment.
What are you doing?
And Robin continued to uphold the high<br/>journalistic standards of Metro News 1.
Is your favorite brand of dental floss<br/>poisoning your entire family?
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...
Tooth.
Okay, I officially hate my job.
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who<br/>shows up at night and scares people.
I'm the bogeyman<br/>with a teleprompter.
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."
That's hilarious!<br/>Great joke, Robin, great joke.
Barney, no offense to Robin,<br/>but that wasn't that funny.
Are you kidding?<br/>That was a great joke.
It's smart, funny, beautiful,<br/>the whole package.
It's everything you're afraid<br/>to let yourself want.
In a joke.
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."
Classic.
Okay, what is so urgent<br/>that you called me and begged me
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?
I could tell you knew something<br/>was up with me, and you're right.
But I can't tell you what it is.<br/>I should tell you, but I can't!
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.<br/>Let's just drop it. What's up with you?
Barney, just say it.
I think I'm in love with Robin.
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas<br/>for Stella's wedding shower.
Does she like to cook?
Actually, I don't know.
What's her favorite color?
Don't know that either.
- Well, does she have any hobbies?<br/>- Yes.
She's exactly the kind of person<br/>who would have hobbies.
And interests, too.
I am one lucky son of a bitch.
Dude,
you don't know anything<br/>about the woman you're marrying.
What?
You're crazy! I know plenty.
What color are her eyes?
The color of the ocean<br/>after a storm.
Which is?
Beautiful.
I don't believe it.
I thought you called me over here<br/>to uncuff you from your sex swing again,
but you're in love?
That is so sweet!
It's not "sweet."
It's like a disease.
I slept with Robin one time<br/>and I caught feelings.
I caught feelings bad.
I used protection and everything.
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,<br/>you just have them.
- And they're good.<br/>- They're terrible!
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
She's all I think about.<br/>I close my eyes, I see Robin.
I, I hear a song;<br/>It reminds me of Robin.
Morning.
I sleep with that chick,<br/>I'm thinking about Robin.
Okay, so I don't know<br/>every single detail about Stella.
What's really about?<br/>Do you not like her or something?
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.<br/>She's a Mets fan.
Really?
It's just that everything with you<br/>has moved so fast.
You've only known<br/>each other a few months.
Don't you think maybe you should<br/>slow things down a little bit?
- Get to know each other better?<br/>- I'll have a whole life
time to get to know her better.
Right now,<br/>I know the one thing that I have to:
that I love her.
You love her?
Barney, how can you be in love,
and still be sleeping<br/>with anything that moves?
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.
That's like saying,
"How can an ant carry<br/>"20 times its body weight,
but root beer floats<br/>are still delicious?"
Are the two even related?
Really?
Barney, you're going to have<br/>to stop screwing around
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.
"Boyfriend"?
I don't want to be<br/>Robin's boyfriend.
Well, what do you want, then?
I don't know.<br/>I just want to be with her.
All the time.
I want to hear about her day<br/>and tell her about mine.
I want to hold her hand<br/>and smell her hair.
But I don't want to be<br/>her stupid boyfriend.
Barney, what you just described
is a relationship between<br/>a boyfriend and a girlfriend.
And a pretty clingy one at that.
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out<br/>with this or not?
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I see a confused, little kid in the<br/>corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,
I gotta help the poor,<br/>little bastard.
But only if you stop<br/>sleeping around.
Deal?
Deal.

Stay tuned for the full...
Scoop.
Really?
I know dudes think it's girlie<br/>for a guy to cook, but us ladies?
- We find it mighty sexy.<br/>- Really?
You know...
My grandma taught me how.
- Oh, yeah, she did.<br/>- Yeah.
I had a lot of time after school<br/>to watch her cook because
I wasn't good at sports.
I'm on fire right now.
Delicious. What's in this pesto?
Oh, you know, the usual:<br/>Basil, garlic, olive oil,
but can you guess<br/>my secret ingredient?
Peanuts.
Yes. How did you know that?
- OK, let's my think, what else?<br/>- You know what, sweetie?
I woke up so early<br/>and I had a really long day at work.
And there was that whole thing<br/>where you tried to kill me.
Can we please just go to sleep?
No, I clearly need<br/>to know more about you.
Let's do firsts. First kiss?
Dale Harris, second grade.
You're talking like peck on the cheek<br/>or a full-on passionate making out?
- Passionate making out.<br/>- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.
First time you had sex.
- Dale Harris, second...<br/>- Stop it.
Billy Devito,<br/>sophomore year of college.
Prude.
Molly McKenzie,<br/>junior year of high school.
Slut.
Robin just needs<br/>to see this new see of you.
- So just call her up?<br/>- Just call her up.
It's...
Hi, Robin.
She wasn't there.<br/>I left a voice mail.
You left a voice,<br/>but it wasn't male.
Barney, I don't get it.
You've called a million girls<br/>a million times.
Yeah,<br/>but those were just booty calls.
On a booty call,<br/>you barely even have to talk.
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...<br/>Hey, baby, it's Barney.
You busy tonight? Sweet.
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.
But the later it gets,<br/>the fewer words you need.
Barney. Busy? Sweet.
And by 3:00 in the morning...
Sweet.
A question mark?
You got laid off a question mark?
It's no worse<br/>than your super-obvious code words.
- Rhinoceros.<br/>- We have to go.
Great. Now we need a new code word.
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.<br/>What do I do?
No-no-no-no, aah!<br/>Robin...
Great to hear from you.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
You called, went, and hung up.
What do you want?
Help me!
Just ask her something.
How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Something personal.
At what age<br/>did you first get your period?
Did you just ask me<br/>about about my period?
No, I did not.
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.
Just ask her out.
Robin, I was wondering if...
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.
That was just a practical joke.
I'm not really in love with Robin.
You should've seen<br/>the look on your face.
There's cameras right there<br/>and there and there.
What a legendary prank that<br/>we're never going to speak of again.
Gross.
- First movie you ever saw.<br/>- Benji, 1981.
I watched it recently<br/>with Lucy and I just thought,
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."
What about you?
My dad took me to an old drive-in<br/>to see the original Star Wars.
You know,<br/>I've actually never seen Star Wars.
She's never seen Star Wars?!
Ted, the only people in the universe
who haven't seen Star Wars<br/>are the characters,
and that's 'cause they lived them.
- That's 'cause they lived the Star Wars.<br/>- You've got to calm down.
I told you. You didn't know<br/>this girl well enough. What if...
- you show it to her, she doesn't like it?<br/>- Dude, it's just a movie.
Star Wars is your all-time<br/>favorite movie,
and whether or not Stella likes<br/>it is actually important.
It's like, it's a test<br/>of how compatible you guys are.
It's just a movie.
It's just a movie!
121 awesome minutes later
If Stella doesn't like this movie,
- I can't marry her.<br/>- You can't.
- You want to watch it again?<br/>- I do.
Wait... Where are the boys?<br/>I thought this was a group thing.
I lied. They're not coming<br/>and I'm about to leave.
Why?
Because...
they're not in love with Robin,<br/>and neither am I.
I mean, she's great and sweet.
I'm not going to pretend<br/>that I haven't noticed her body,
but this is off topic.<br/>Good luck.
Wait, wait, I can't do this.
She'll never take me seriously.<br/>She thinks I'm some
womanizing idiot.
We both know<br/>you're more than that.
How Robin the Barney<br/>I met the other day.
You mean the insecure,<br/>touchy-feely she-male
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?
Ted hit that for over a year.
Wish me luck.
I just thought it'd be fun<br/>to watch a movie tonight,
and since you've never seen Star Wars,<br/>I figured why not?
No big deal.
It's pretty good.
Sounds like a plan.
I'm just grab a beer.<br/>You want one?
The movie's already started, so...
It's some words flying through space.<br/>I'm not going to read that anyway.
Oh, my God.
Off to a bad start.
What are you doing down there?
I'm making sure my best friend<br/>is marrying the right woman.
That's what I'm doing.
What are you doing,<br/>hiding behind the couch?
You need to get a job.
I really do, don't I?
So, Robin...
tell me about your day,
and not just what happened,<br/>how you felt about what happened.
- What?<br/>- I'm not looking to problem-solve,
I'm just looking to listen.
- Why are you acting like this?<br/>- Like what?
You're being super nice. It's...
freaking me out. Be...
gross, be inappropriate.<br/>Be Barney.
I'm being Barney,
and I think tonight's going to be
de... wait for it... lightful.
Delightful.
Right.
So I went<br/>to the chiropractor yesterday.
That guy bent me over the table<br/>and pounded me for a good hour.
Is insurance going to cover that?<br/>Sometimes they don't.
That's it?
Today I was at the dentist.
That guy drilled me
all day long.
He drilled me hard.
He filled all of my cavities.
Come on, man.
- Your teeth look fantastic.<br/>- Who are you?
What?
Nothing.
You were staring at me.
You look really beautiful tonight.
You don't look<br/>so bad yourself, mister.
Great scene, great scene.
Star Wars fun fact number seven...
George Lucas based<br/>the film's structure
on Akira Kurosawa's<br/>The Hidden Fortress.
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work<br/>with comparative mythology.
Yeah, Ted,<br/>I'm losing wood over here.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Wait, it's
really important to you<br/>that I like this movie, isn't it?
I'm not gonna like it with you<br/>staring at me the whole time.
Go to your room<br/>and I will come get you when it's over.
Go.
Should I leave, too?
What part, what part?
Thanks.
Nothing?
Not even a glance?
Even I was thinking about rocking<br/>a motorboat on those bad boys.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I don't always want to be that guy.<br/>Sometimes I want to be someone
you can have<br/>an actual conversation with.
Now, tell me something about you<br/>that I don't know yet.
Seriously.
There's a job opening<br/>at a new cable network
that would be perfect for me...
completely legit world news, interviews<br/>with people who matter...
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.<br/>- Why not?
Because I'm a joke.
I'm just the scary news lady<br/>from some stupid local news channel.
We both know you're more than that.
Promise me you'll apply.
- It's not as easy...<br/>- Promise me you'll apply.
I promise.
She's up to the scene<br/>where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.<br/>- Great scene.
Greatscene?
Okay, we should have just heard...
but Stella didn't make a peep.<br/>I'm gonna take a look.
She's not even watching.<br/>She's texting.
- I'll tell her you still want to be friends.<br/>- I don't believe this.
I believe, she knows this is important<br/>to me. She's blatantly...
"Stop watching me, jackasses."
- To taking chances.<br/>- To taking chances.
You know, Robin, there's actually something,<br/>I do want to talk to you about.
- Last call.<br/>- Of course it is.
- One more for the road?<br/>- Yeah, why not?
Hold that thought?
I will.
- I loved it.<br/>- Yes!
I am marrying a woman<br/>who is not only hot
but loves Star Wars.<br/>That's the dream.
- What was that?<br/>- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me
through the space-time continuum.<br/>We did it.
We did it,<br/>you masturbating little bastard.
Champagne for everybody.
It was so good.
- You hated it, didn't you?<br/>- It's so stupid. First of all,
how do they understand that walking bear<br/>they hang around with all the time?
- Wookiee.<br/>- He goes...
They're all like,<br/>"That's a good point, Bear,
- "let's try that."<br/>- He's a Wookiee,
and his kind is actually<br/>more intelligent than they appear.
That is Ted's favorite movie<br/>of all time.
He watches it<br/>when he's home sick with the flu.
He watches it on rainy<br/>Sunday afternoons in the fall.
He watches it on Christmas Eve.
Ted watches Star Wars<br/>in sickness and in health,
in good times and in bad.
Do you really think that you can pretend<br/>to like a movie that you actually hate
for the rest of your life?
I do.
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.
Bear.
So, here's the deal.
April, have... you met Barney?
April just finished her shift,<br/>she's looking to blow off some steam.
Would you excuse us for one sec?
- What are you doing?<br/>- You were so nice to me tonight,
I wanted to return the favor,<br/>wingwoman-style.
So, as I was saying,
Barney is the Yankees'<br/>new second-baseman.
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,<br/>you could hit a goal for her
during the baseball match.
You can't make this stuff up.
So, you two kids have fun.
So are you...<br/>nervous about the game?
Yeah, I'm nervous<br/>for the other team
'cause when I step<br/>up to that plate...
I am not a New York Yankee.
Any other night, I would probably try<br/>to convince you that I am, but I'm not.
I'm just some guy who's in love<br/>with the girl that just left,
and she's never going<br/>to feel the same way.
So I'm just going to go.
And that was it.
I'm so sorry, Barney.
You can't give up.
You know, it may take some time,<br/>but once Robin sees the new you...
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,<br/>are the tickets under your name or mine?
My name, and tell your<br/>nephews to bring their mitts.
They're going to be<br/>in foul ball country.
Come on.<br/>The Robin stuff was completely true.
Damn it, Barney.
I mean, for the last time,
you can't... you can't
be in love with Robin<br/>and still be sleeping
with every bimbo on the planet.
You have to choose right now.
- I choose bimbos.<br/>- What?
Bimbos make me happy.<br/>Bimbos make me feel alive.
Bimbos make me want<br/>to pretend to be a better man.
This whole thing with Robin was just<br/>a fling, but at the end of the day,
my heart belongs to bimbos.
This is just a defense mechanism,<br/>because
you're afraid of getting hurt.<br/>You're just confused.
Oh, I'm not confused.
You know who is confused?
Bimbos.
They're easily confused.<br/>It's one of the thousand little things
I love about them.
I love their vacant,
trusting stares, their sluggish,<br/>unencumbered minds,
their unresolved daddy issues.
I love them and they love me.
Bimbos have always been there for me,<br/>through thick and thin.
Mostly thin.<br/>B- man don't do thick crust.
What up?
See you, Barney.
Chimixanga.
We have to go.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, when I first<br/>moved to New York,
it was dingy, disgusting,
dirty, ugly,
flea-ridden,<br/>stinky
and all together, terrifying.
But then,
sadly...
the whole city started to go...
uphill.
The streets got a little cleaner,
the rents got a little higher,
and one by one,
the crappy old places we loved
began to disappear.
The Elbow Room,<br/>an old punk rock club,
became a drugstore;
McHale's, a working-class<br/>watering hole,
became a fast-food place;
and Fez, this awesome<br/>lounge in 95th in Broadway,
became a bank.
And not just any bank.
Goliath National Bank.
The world leader<br/>in credit and banking.
God, I love Goliath National Bank!
Okay, first of all, you look like<br/>the last pick in the draft.
And... second, why are you so excited<br/>about some bank?
Our company just bought them out<br/>in a ruthless takeover.
Took two months.<br/>Cost 2,000 jobs.
It was brutal.
Who wants a T-shirt?
Hey, Marshall, they're hiring<br/>in the legal department.
I could get you a job.
Barney, Marshall didn't quit<br/>his last soul-sucking corporate job
just to go work at a bank.
He's gonna be<br/>an environmental lawyer.
That was the plan, anyway.
Over the next few weeks,<br/>Marshall went on a lot of interviews.
You are confident,
you are energetic,
you are focused!
A lot of interviews.
You are flexible on salary,
you're willing to compromise,
you're not gonna cry this time.
Too many interviews.
You are sad,
you are beaten down,
you will get through this,
come home,
get in your big underpants
and take a nap.
Which brings us<br/>to September 29,
the night of the burger.
So... what do you guys<br/>want to do for dinner?
We just got a new cook.
You have to try the burger...<br/>it's amazing.
Oh, great...<br/>we'll take five of those.
Five burgers.
Whoa... really?<br/>You... want to eat here?
Yeah, I'm freaking starving.<br/>I just finished a seven-day cleanse.
I thought you just started that<br/>yesterday.
I finished early, okay?
- Five of those.<br/>- Five burgers.
Whoa... wait.<br/>What about sushi?
- We had sushi last night.<br/>- Italian.
I had Italian for lunch.
- I can come back.<br/>- No. We always do this.
We spend an hour arguing<br/>about where to eat,
and then we end up<br/>eating here anyway.
I haven't eaten for two days.
Can we please, for the love of God,<br/>just order something now?
Chinese?
I don't like Chinese.
Indian?
I just said<br/>I don't like Chinese.
Indian isn't Chinese.
Weird meats, funny music, side of rice.
Why are we splitting hairs?
Mexican?
I just said<br/>I don't like Chinese.
Oh, God.

Robin, yours will be right out.
Of course, mine comes last.
Go ahead, start without me.
- Sweet!<br/>- That's so kind of you.
Oh, my God.
This burger is so good.
It's like Christmas in my mouth...<br/>meat Christmas.
It's like an angel from heaven
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's.
Where the chef killed it and ran it<br/>through the meat grinder.
I love this burger so much,
I want to sew my ass shut.
It's okay.
- Are you kidding me?<br/>- Guys, guys, guys.
When you've had the best burger<br/>in New York City,
every other burger tastes<br/>like my grandpa's feet.
But you guys eat up,<br/>enjoy, my grandpa's feet.
And you've had the best burger<br/>in New York.
It was eight years ago,
my first week in New York,
and for a kid from Minnesota,
the big city was a scary place.
Thank God it's just you.
You are being ridiculous.
- Tell me you left the apartment today.<br/>- Why would I have to leave?
I can have anything I want delivered,<br/>and New York City cable is awesome.
Have you seen this public access show<br/>with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?
It's, it's disgusting.
Marshall, you have to<br/>get over this paranoia.
You are not gonna get mugged.
Well, what if I do, Ted, all right?<br/>I don't have a switchblade.
I don't, I don't know how to,<br/>how to break-dance
and win the begrudging respect<br/>of a street gang.
That's it, you're taking a walk.<br/>Come on, go.
No. Look, the old lady<br/>in a bikini is back on.
I'm just gonna lie back<br/>and get comfortable.
Go! Go outside, go, go.
Okay.
- Leave the bat.<br/>- Fine.
So I went for a walk<br/>in the big, scary city.
And I discovered<br/>something amazing,
it wasn't scary at all.
All right.
What's the word?
Your search is over!
And then, right when I started<br/>to get a little hungry,
I turned a corner...
and there it was.
The tiniest little<br/>burger joint you ever saw,
tucked between a taxidermist<br/>and a triple-X bookstore.
Name two places<br/>where things get stuffed.
So, I went inside.
And I ordered...<br/>the burger.
Thank you.
Ted. Ted, you got to wake up.<br/>Ted, wake...
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.<br/>Are you okay?
I'm all right.
Ted. Ted, I've just had the most<br/>amazing burger of my life!
It's this awesome little place,<br/>Regis Philbin eats there,
so it's sort of like<br/>a celebrity hot spot.
But the burger, Ted. The burger.
Dude. I want one of those burgers<br/>right now!
Do you think they're still open?
I don't know. Does stuff in New York<br/>stay open past... 9:30?
So we went out to get another burger.
But after hours of searching...
Damn it!<br/>Where is this place?
You couldn't find it?
We didn't know our way around.
Just getting back<br/>to the apartment took us
three hours<br/>and one very helpful drag queen.
Wait, Betty Noir was a drag queen?
Well, where do you think it was?
Probably tucked between her legs.
You know what's not a drag?
Getting a home equity loan<br/>at Goliath National Bank.
I'm just saying.
Anyways... we never found the place.
Now, eight years have passed, still...
no burger.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Okay, here we go.
I know the place you're talking about.
No, you don't.
It's a place called the Corner Bistro.
Great burger.
Oh, the Corner Bistro!
It's amazing,<br/>I spent a quarter of my life
searching for the best burger<br/>in New York City,
but silly me, it never occurred to me
to check the highest-rated burger<br/>in the Zagat guide.
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.
Let me return the favor.
Great cup of coffee,
Starbucks.
So I take it you've tried<br/>the Corner Bistro.
I've tried every so-called best burger
in New York City<br/>trying to find that burger.
Or at least forget about her.
We're going.
But none of those places<br/>even came close.
Hey, there was that one time we thought<br/>we had a break in the case, remember?
Get this.
You know who works out at my gym?
Regis Philbin.
The autographed picture.
Of course I remember the place.
It was the best burger I ever had.
I still have dreams about this burger.
Beautiful, haunting dreams!
I wake up at night screaming,<br/>"Get out of my head, burger! Get out!"
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.
Do you remember where it is?
No! I never wrote it down.
But not a day goes by<br/>that I don't regret it.
Why? Why? Do you know where it is?
And if you tell me<br/>it's at the Corner Bistro,
I'm gonna smack you right in the face!
We don't, we don't know where it is.
Listen, Blondie!<br/>Don't mess with me!
Daddy needs his meat.
I don't know where it is,<br/>Regis, I swear!
What about you, Lurch?
And what about you, satchel-mouth?
This is my cell.
You find that burger,<br/>you call me day or night.
Okay, Regis, we will, we will.
All right, so what are you waiting for?<br/>Get out and find the burger!
- All right, all right.<br/>- Let's go, all of you!
That's where my story ends.
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth<br/>forever searching for that green door
and that red neon sign<br/>that says "Burger."
Green door, red neon sign<br/>that says "Burger?"
- Yeah.<br/>- I know that place.
I've walked by it a million times.<br/>It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.
I knew it was on a numbered street!
- Finally.<br/>- No! Robin!
If any of us is gonna eat<br/>a burger tonight,
it's gonna be the best burger<br/>in New York.
We're going downtown!
I cannot believe<br/>we're finally gonna have this burger.
Honey, I'm so excited for you.
After all these interviews,
after all these disappointments,
you deserve a triumphant<br/>mouth full of meat.
You know what else is a mouthful?
All that double-talk other banks<br/>give you.
At Goliath, customer satisfaction<br/>is our most important investment.
Barney, I hate to break this to you,<br/>but working for a bank's kind of lame.
Oh, yeah.
How lame is free automatic bill pay,<br/>Lil?
How lame is 3. 3% APY online savings?
Yeah! That's right.
Hate to make you look stupid
in front of your friends,<br/>but you left me no choice.
We should probably call Regis.
Reg... Oh, that guy scares me.
I think I'll leave him a text.
Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads.
The one before that was tails.
You polled the audience,
they came out split, 50/50.
No help at all there.
So, for $258,000...
I have to ask you, Kathy,
what's it gonna be,
heads... or...
Excuse me.
Oh, boy. I-I've got to go.<br/>I've got to go!
Green door, red neon sign.<br/>Guys, this is the place.
No, I've actually, I've actually...<br/>I prepared a few words.
I will eat your hand.
All right, well,<br/>let's just go inside then. Shall we?
- Thank you.<br/>- You're welcome.
Yours will be right out.
Please, go ahead, start.
- Just shut up and eat.<br/>- All right.
Oh, my God.
I'm never brushing my teeth again
unless it's with a toothbrush made<br/>from this burger.
I think I just had my first burg-asm.
I want...
to take this burger out to dinner,
then maybe a movie,
then take it back to my place,
put on a little Terence Trent D'arby,<br/>and then I would just...
fool around a little bit.
Nothing serious...<br/>just take it slow, you know?
- This isn't it.<br/>- What?
It's not it.
Okay, Marshall, you might not want<br/>to hear this, but...
is it at all possible this is the same<br/>burger you had eight years ago,
only it could never live up<br/>to your ridiculously high expectations?
I mean, it is just a burger.
Just a burger?
Just a burger?
Robin, it's so much more<br/>than just a burger.
I, I mean, that first bite...
Oh, what heaven that first bite is.
The bun, like a sesame freckled,
breast of an angel,<br/>resting gently on
the ketchup and mustard below.
Flavors mingling in a seductive<br/>pas de deux.
And then...
a pickle...
the most playful little pickle,
and then a slice of tomato,
a leaf of lettuce, and a,
a patty of ground beef so...
exquisite...
swirling in your mouth,
breaking apart and combining again
in a fugue of sweets and savories so...
delightful.
This is no mere sandwich<br/>of grilled meat
and toasted bread, Robin.
This is God...
speaking to us through food.
And you got our wedding vows<br/>off the Internet.
Okay... look, so, so this,<br/>this isn't the place.
All right, it's no big deal.
It's another place<br/>with a green door
and a red neon sign that says "Burger."
I'll just... I'll call every restaurant<br/>in Manhattan
and ask 'em what color their door is.
No big deal, right? Let's do this.
I'm going to go out on a limb here<br/>and say this isn't just about a burger.
Marshall's not doing so well, guys.
He really needs to get a job.
Tell them about the underpants.
What about the underpants?
It started a couple of weeks ago.
Heads! It's going to be heads.
It's almost usually heads.
- Hey, baby.<br/>- Hey...
Did you put on pants today?
Nope.
It was funny at first,<br/>but then it became a daily thing.
I thought, "Okay, well, at least<br/>he's not leaving the house like that."
Then, one day, he opened the door<br/>to get the paper.
Day after that,<br/>went downstairs to get the mail.
Everyone's got an underpants radius.
For most of us, it's the distance<br/>from the bedroom to the bathroom,
but as your self esteem gets smaller,
your underpants radius gets bigger.
How big is Marshall's<br/>underpants radius?
We're going.
Come on, Lily,<br/>he'll find a job eventually.
You know, Lil, when times are tough,
I like to remember the uplifting words<br/>of my favorite song.
We'll be on your side<br/>when you need a friend
Through thick and thin<br/>you can always depend
On the world leaders<br/>In credit and banking...
Goliath National Bank.
Member FDIC.
We've got to find Marshall that burger.
Lily, I think we're all<br/>eating that burger.
I'm not eating that burger.
No, if Marshall says this isn't<br/>the burger, this isn't the burger.
Finally.
- Excuse me.<br/>- Yes.
Did you guys change cooks or something?
Because my husband was here<br/>five years ago,
and he's pretty sure<br/>he had a different burger.
Yeah, we get this a lot.
This place is modeled<br/>after this other place uptown
with the same green door<br/>and "Burger" sign.
What? Uptown? Where?
106th and Manhattan Avenue.
Damn it.
106 a numbered street.<br/>Of course.
Barney Stinson.
Barney, where the hell are you?
I'm sorry, this is...
Regis. I'm at the place.
Oh, Regis, of course.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br/>I forgot to call you.
That's not the place.
The real place is on 106th<br/>and Manhattan Avenue.
We're headed there right now.
What? Uptown?
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.
If you get there first, medium rare.
- Onions?<br/>- Onions?
- Okay, no onions.<br/>- Stop the cab!
Wait.<br/>This is it.
Your search is over.
- We got girls taking off their clothes.<br/>- This is it.
One of 9,000 convenient locations.
It was ri...<br/>it was right here.
It was,<br/>it was right on this very spot.
I don't understand.<br/>Where is the burger place?
It's not a burger place anymore,<br/>it's a...
Goliath National Bank ATM.
Well, that's fine.<br/>Let's just eat here.
We can't eat here.<br/>It's an ATM.
But, food.
Hey, what the...?
This is your fault,<br/>you and your stupid bank.
- You did this.<br/>- It's not my... stop, okay.
Stop that, Lily.
I will never use a<br/>Goliath ATM ever again.
Goliath National Bank sucks.
It's the worst bank on<br/>the face of the earth.
Attention, New Yorkers,<br/>this bank sucks! They suck!
- Marshall, will you just tell her already?<br/>- They suck, suck, suck!
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
I got a job.
What? Where?
Goliath National Bank.
That's why Barney's been going on and<br/>on about how, how great Goliath is.
He wanted you<br/>to be excited for me since
we're going<br/>to be working there together.
Well, technically not together.
You won't have access to my floor.
But you want to be<br/>an environmental lawyer.
Yeah, you know, and I also want to be<br/>a Harlem Globetrotter
and get paid in candy, but...
in the meantime, I need a job, and<br/>this is, this is a really good one.
It's great pay<br/>and there's good benefits,
and to be honest,
it gives me a reason<br/>to put on pants in the morning.
You know, I have my whole life<br/>to save the planet, but right now,
I'm kind of really excited<br/>to wear pants again.
You've got great pants.
- I love you.<br/>- I love you.
Robin, no.
- They're unopened.<br/>- Give it.
- They're barbecue.<br/>- Give it!
I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.
It's stupid.
I think about that first week<br/>in New York. You know?
I was 22 years old.
I had my whole future ahead of me.
I guess I just kind of thought that if<br/>I could have that burger one more time
and feel that way for one more night,
that I might be able<br/>to check that off the list,
and grow up,
go work for the stupid bank,<br/>and just...
be happy.
You know, that burger place isn't gone.
It just moved to a new location.
And I can tell you where that is<br/>for a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?<br/>That's crazy.
Let's pay the man.
- I paid for the cab.<br/>- I don't have any cash.
I haven't worked since March.
Wow, if only there were an easy,
convenient way<br/>to get some cash right now.
Member FDIC.
So we paid the guy,<br/>and 20 minutes later...
All right, Marshall, remember.
It might not taste as good.
This place has changed, you've changed,<br/>New York has changed.
Just... don't get your hopes up<br/>too high, okay?
- This is it.<br/>- Yes!
It's exactly the same.
It's the best burger in New York.
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.
And so, after finally tasting again
the burger he'd craved<br/>for so many years,
Marshall got up the next morning,
put on some pants,<br/>and went to work,
and he never looked back.
I want to get tiny fitted sheets<br/>for this burger,
and just crawl into this bun,<br/>get all cozy, and die there.
Oh, my God.<br/>I just want you inside of me.
This feels so good.
I'm worried<br/>I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.
If he does get that burger pregnant,
I have dibs<br/>on the delicious burger babies.
- This isn't it.<br/>- What?
No, Regis Philbin. Come on.
That's outrageous.<br/>That is unbelievable.
Wait. This is it, yes!
You were just freakin'<br/>teasing us, Philbin.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the fall of 2008,<br/>I've had a little problem.
All right, I got to get to Stella's.
Tonight's the night guys, I've tried it<br/>before, I've failed every time.
This time, I'm gonna do it.<br/>Tonight...
I pick up a lesbian.
Robin,
I need your lipstick.
Oh, man!
Take pictures, all right?
Bye Ted.
I lived in New York,
but Stella lived accross the river...
in New Jersey.
Oh, man!
Which meant,<br/>I was always taking the train.
What's up, Ted?
Hey Matisse.
Hey, T-diddy!<br/>You missed it!
Robin got that national anchor job!
And we got<br/>a free bottle of champagne!
But it's empty now.
Oh, man!
And as a result, it seamed like<br/>I was missing out on everything.
Sorry we couldn't wait.<br/>It was getting cold.
Oh, man!
- Hey big guy!<br/>- What's up, G?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...
you know I want to<br/>hang out with you guys,
I want to hang out with my friends.
It just feel like I'm spending<br/>all my time on the train.
Okay, how about this? Why don't you ask<br/>your friends to come up here sometime?
That's a great idea!
You want us to go to New Jersey?<br/>Oh, that is rich.
Why?
Well, for starters, I don't have any<br/>of my gold medaillons anymore.
I sold them when they went out<br/>of style, 400 years ago.
- Lily?<br/>- Oh, sorry, Ted.
I'm a born and raised New Yorker.
I'm programmed to despise and loathe
New Jersey and<br/>all that it stands for.
Why am I telling you this?
You hate New Jersey<br/>more than anyone.
What? I don't hate New Jersey!<br/>Why would you think that?
And then he cut in front of me!<br/>God, I hate line cutters
more than I hate...<br/>New Jersey.
Well that's not true,
there's nothing I hate more<br/>than New Jersey.
Nice?
Hey, you want us to wait for you?
No, it might be awhile,<br/>I got a drop a massive New Jersey.
Okay, so New Jersey's<br/>not my favourite place
but once Stella<br/>and I get married,
and she and Lucy<br/>move in with me,
I'll never set foot<br/>in New Jersey again.
Unless I'm going to see<br/>a Giants game or,
flying down at Newark, or,
God forbid, disposing of a body.
Ted, if you murder me,<br/>and bury me in New Jersey
I'll haunt you for ever.
But if I murder you and<br/>bury you in somewhere else?
I'll leave you alone.<br/>I'm sure you had your reasons.
Sync by vNaru
Kids, your aunt Robin was sick<br/>of her job in Metro News One.
She was sick<br/>of the low production value.
I'm Robin Scherbatsky<br/>and your watching...
Etro News One at 11:00...
and again at 1:00.
Sick of the stories<br/>she had to report...
So hurry up and get your votes in...
for New York's cutest doggie.
And most of all,
she was sick of all<br/>the stupids puns.
Four transit workers<br/>were electrocuted
when a subway train<br/>jumped the tracks.
Stay tuned for the...
shocking derails.
Joel, people died.
So when the call came in
that she got<br/>the big national anchor job,
she finally got to say the words
she'd been dreaming of saying<br/>for years...
Tonight will be my last broadcast.
I came to Metro News One as a<br/>little caterpillar,
and for four years,
this desk has been my cocoon,
but tonight, I emerge,
an ambitious butterfly.
Why does she sound like an idiot?<br/>Did she have a stroke?
Yeah, a stroke of genius.
This speech is really good.
With one eye on the horizon,
one eye on the truth,
and one eye, on all of you.
You wrote it for her,<br/>didn't you?
It's a modified version of the...
speech I gave when I had to leave<br/>the swim team because
of the chronic inner ear situation.
I thought you were the towel-boy.
It's part of the team!
So that saturday,
as Robin went off for her first day<br/>at her new job,
we're all headed accross the river
to experience some of<br/>that crazy New Jersey night life.
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,<br/>so we can't go out. Instead,
we're all gonna hang out here,
and it's gonna be just as awesome.
Right? We got board games,<br/>we got movies,
and I think there may be some beer,<br/>out in the garage.
Ted, this is pathetic!
It's saturday night,<br/>we should be out at the bar,
drinking alcohol!
Now, I know this sounds depressing,<br/>bordering on tragic,
but it's just a fact.
Yeah, and I want another crack<br/>at that chick, Doris.
I know I can land that lesbian plane.
No snakes on that plan.
Okay, guys, come on,<br/>you promised.
Let's just hang out here,
try to have fun.<br/>I mean,
we're all together.
Friends hanging out,<br/>isn't that would really matters?
Okay, if we take the next train,
we could be at MacLaren's by 11:00!
We can be there by 10:00?
No, I have to change first,
I'm not walking into MacLaren's<br/>smelling like New Jersey.
You guys really hate it here?
- What?<br/>- No! Stells.
No, no, I get it, I mean<br/>you guys are all New Yorkers,
you need to hang out at a bar.
Well, you could,
just hang out<br/>on the coolest bar in state,
which is so close it<br/>will blow your mind.
And boom goes the dynamite.
The coolest bar in New Jersey.
Yeah, it probably is...
This is great!
We got darts,
half a ping-pong table,
a fish bowl,
look what turned out to be<br/>an awesome night as promised.
Maybe we can drop some bac-o's<br/>in here, and make them fight.
No thanks.<br/>I don't mess with fish bowls unless
they have my two favorite fish.
The sucker fish
and the blow fish.<br/>What up?
For blow fish?
I don't think so.
- Marshall?<br/>- You're better than that.
Lily?
Not good enough.
Stella?
Sorry.
I am not lowering this,
until someone gives me the respect
of another person's knuckles
tapping against mine
in a light but decisive manner.
Pretty-pretty...
Pretty-pretty...
Pretty-pret...<br/>who's a pretty baby?
Then know this,
until it gets what it wants, nay,
deserves,
this fist,
will not yield.
It...
will...
not...
yield.
So who wants to play Scrabble?
Sure. Whatever.
Oh, heads up.
The X tile is a little hard to read<br/>because, a couple years ago,
it went all the way<br/>through my dog.
You konw, maybe<br/>we should get a dog again,
When you move in.
When I what?
Oh great, there's Robin.
I thought they were moving in<br/>with you.
So did I.
Oh God, am I moving<br/>to New Jersey?
Hey guys,
I bet that dog was really
flying high<br/>after it swallow the little X.
Nailed it!
Come on!
I can't live here.
It wouldn't be that bad.
You could put a mini- fridge over there
and maybe some knock hockey.
Knock hockey.<br/>Nice one, big mon.
Yeah, I meant New Jersey<br/>in general, not this basement.
She wants me to move here?
I don't get it.<br/>We discussed this months ago.
So, I was thinking,<br/>after the wedding,
you and Lucy, can move in here
Yeah, she could play out<br/>on the fire escape,
maybe make friends with that guy
who sleeps on that couch in the alley,
ride her bike up and down Broadway.
It's a great idea, Ted.
I don't understand
why you'd want to live in New Jersey
when you have a chance<br/>to live in Manhattan?
I thought having<br/>a rent-controlled apartment
on the Upper West Side was half<br/>the reason she agreed to marry me.
Really, I thought it was<br/>the whole reason.
What is up?!
- Hey.<br/>- Robin, hey.
You're looking good.
Bump the Barnacle.
Stella already told me not to.
How was your first day?
It wasn't.
- What?<br/>- It wasn't my first day.
I showed up<br/>and there were 20 other people.
It turns out,<br/>I didn't actually get the job.
I only got an audition.
What, how did that happen?
I don't know.<br/>Because he told me that I got it.
I got it?
I got it!
And just to be clear,<br/>when I say you got it
I mean an audition.
You got an audition.
I don't want there to be any confusion.<br/>You have an audition
only.
Not the job.
Thank you.<br/>Thank you!
Okay, I'm going to call and beg<br/>Joel to give me my job back.
You hated that job.
I don't know, it wasn't so bad.
Robin, what did they make you call
Tropical Storm Hector<br/>when it was raining cats and dogs?
A furricane.
Hey, Ted.
Rock me like a furricane.
Thanks.
Mean.
Okay, yeah, it's sucks,
but what can I do?
I mean, I'm not going<br/>to get that other job.
You guys should have seen<br/>the other women at this audition.
They all had more experience than me,
were more ethnic than me.
There was an African-American chick
with blue eyes,
how can I compete with that?
You can't.
No, you can compete with anyone.
You're Robin Scherbatsky.
Confident. Strong. Tall.
With crazy long legs<br/>that look great in shorts.
I'm calling Joel.
But, no Robin,<br/>if you call him right now,
you will hate yourself
Look, I have slept with lots of women
who afterwards told me off<br/>and stormed out.
And sometimes<br/>they'd pick up the phone
and they'd call me
and then we'd hook up again.
And when we were finished,<br/>I could see that look on their faces,
that look that says<br/>they hate themselves
and they wish they'd never called.
But if you could see...
that look,<br/>actually, you can see that look,
there's a video.<br/>www...
- dot...<br/>- No! Stop, okay? I won't call.
Don't drink the beer!
I just remembered when I bought it.
It was right before<br/>I got pregnant with Lucy.
Ted, would you mind running<br/>to PriceCo and picking some up?
Oh, and while you're there,
maybe you could sign up for a card.<br/>I mean,
you'll probably end up<br/>going there all the time.
That's the look.
I can't move here.<br/>I hate it here.
I would kill myself.
Maybe New Jersey is not that bad.
Stella has a lawn.
You could get a riding lawn mower.
They sell them over there.
I saw one with a cup holder.
I saw a recliner<br/>with a built-in cup holder.
I even saw a hammock<br/>with a cup holder.
You live in New Jersey,
you never have to hold a cup again.
I don't think I have as big a problem<br/>holding cups as you do.
I will give you $100<br/>to fist pump me.
$200.
Just put it down, Barney.
Your arm must be killing you by now.
$10,000.
Look, you'll be right across the river.<br/>You'll be in New York all the time.
- Oh, yeah?<br/>- Yeah.
Excuse me.
You guys are from New York, right?
Yeah, we moved here<br/>from Manhattan.
Do you ever get into the city?
All the time.
See? All the time.
When was the last time you were there?
We just had dinner at O'Rourke's.
That's been closed for six years.
It has been awhile.
Funny, we don't miss it.
Well, I guess we're<br/>New Jersians now.
Honey, look, dog shirts.
I can't do it.<br/>I'm just going to tell Stella
she and Lucy have to move into the city<br/>and that's that.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Beagle or Boston terrier?
Are those tears?
They're awesome...
manly pain tears.<br/>They're not emotional.
Okay, they're a little bit emotional.
Where's Robin?
Hey, Shirley,<br/>it's Robin calling for Joel.
Robin, hang up the phone.<br/>Don't do this.
Sorry, I know, okay?
If you don't hang up right now...
Hey, Joel, it's Robin.
So Madam Butterfly<br/>wants to come back to the cocoon.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry<br/>I said all that stuff.
Well, you can stick your sorries<br/>in your sock drawer,
'cause you've already been replaced.
I've got Brian in make up<br/>and he couldn't be more excited.
I can't do this.<br/>I can't do this.
Okay, look, as much<br/>as I want to see college boy
here wet himself on camera,
if you can get here in time<br/>to read the 11:00 news,
you can have your old job back.
Okay, I have a half hour<br/>to make it to the studio.
There's no way you can make it<br/>to the city in a half hour.
Robin, don't do this.
I know it's scary to bet on yourself,
but if you don't, nobody else will.
And I'm not just saying that<br/>to get a fist bump.
Although, come on,<br/>a fist bump would be great.
But I really mean it.
I am betting on myself.
I am betting that I can make it there<br/>by 11 o'clock
Hey, did you get the beer?
Yeah, I got 144-pack.
The rest is in the trunk.
And did you sign up<br/>for the membership?
Why not?
There was a line for the photos...
my hair's a mess...
I don't want to move to New Jersey.
What?
I can't do it.
And I can't see any reason
why you and Lucy<br/>shouldn't move to New York.
Well, my daughter goes to school here.
All of her friends are here.
I've lived here my whole life.
My whole family is here.
This is my house.
I'm on the PTA, and as of June 1,
I'm the deputy mayor.
Yes, but my apartment<br/>is really close to the subway.
Ted, we're not moving,<br/>end of discussion.
How can it be end of discussion
if there's never been a discussion?
This is part of being a parent.
I can't just uproot Lucy.
People with kids move<br/>all the time. And...
I think it would be really great<br/>for Lucy
to grow up<br/>in the greatest city in the world.
Here we go...
New York's the greatest city<br/>in the whole wide world.
It's where dreams come true
and pigeon poop<br/>tastes like tapioca.
Want to know a little secret, Ted?
New Jersey is better than New York.
Better than...?
You think...? I...
The Empire State Buil...
H and H Bage...
Lincoln Ce...
Zabar's...
Papaya King.
New York is the intellectual
and cultural hub of the planet.
New York is full of weirdoes,<br/>and snobs and mean people.
Ted, do you know that once,<br/>an old lady
actually called me a bitch<br/>and threw a cat in my face?
And you want to know<br/>if that happened in New Jersey?
86th and Lex,
right in front of your beloved<br/>little Papaya King.
People are nice in New Jersey.
I mean it's the kind of place<br/>where you know your neighbors.
- Hey, I know my neighbors.<br/>- Oh, yeah? Like who?
Right across the hall, I got...
Clax... pa... mon...
- Claxpamon?<br/>- His name is Paxton.
Love that dude.
Sorry, in a hurry.<br/>Got to get to the front.
Got to get off first.
Don't run over Matisse.
Okay, so this is crazy.
You can't actually think
that New Jersey<br/>is better than New York.
New York has Broadway.<br/>We win right there.
Oh, no, she did not.
Knuckle up for safety.
We have Atlantic City.
Can't beat the A.C.
Pretty please?<br/>No one has to know.
New York has Greenwich Village.
New Jersey has The Shore.
Woody Allen.
Oscar-winning chronicler<br/>of urban neuroses.
Bump it!
- Bruce Springsteen.<br/>- Sinatra.
He's from Hoboken...
- New Jersey.<br/>- Yeah, but what city is
he singing about?
It's not "Secaucus, Secaucus."
Come on...
Now you kids<br/>can either believe this or not,
but this is how your<br/>Aunt Robin swears it happened.
Look, Stella,
I understand that coming<br/>from New Jersey
you don't picture yourself<br/>loving New York,
but trust me,<br/>Marshall didn't expect to,
and now he wouldn't think<br/>of living anywhere else.
I hate New York!
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Okay, today I was walking<br/>around PriceCo.
Have you ever been there?<br/>It's huge.
All the stores in New York<br/>are so cramped.
Every time I turn,<br/>I knock something over.
I'm like some huge monster<br/>that came out of the ocean
to destroy bodegas.
But, Marshall, you love New York.
Yeah, I do, except that I hate it.
I'm too big for New York, okay?
I'm always trying to fit<br/>into cramped little subway seats
or duck under doorways<br/>that were built 150 years ago.
Hey, guess what?<br/>People are bigger now.
Build bigger doorways.<br/>What the hell is the matter with you?
Small city, big man...<br/>give it up.
And it's so loud, all the time.
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.
Well, guess what, I like to sleep.
I've been tired for eight years.
Tired and scared with black<br/>and blue marks on my elbows
from trying to fit through<br/>all these tiny elf doorways.
New Jersey's great.
It's got huge stores,
and lawns and you never have<br/>to carry a cup again.
Not for the rest of your life.
I'm not afraid to say it...
I love New Jersey.
I'm just kidding.
Look, Stella...
I get it, okay?
I see what you're saying.
I guess...
we could live in Brooklyn.
You know what, Ted...
live wherever you want.
I don't care.
Awkward silence.Tap it.
Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?
There was some loud noises<br/>in the basement.
Sorry about that.
Why don't you got back to bed, sweetie.
I can't go to sleep without a story.
- Okay, I'll just get your mom...<br/>- Why don't you read it to me?
Okay, come on.
I'm moving here.
Really?
Really.
New Jersey wins.
Thank you!
Wait...
Good evening, New York.
Hey, look, she made it.
Our top story tonight...
the newborn panda<br/>at the Central Park Zoo
got its first tooth today.
I guess that makes her a...
molar bear.
Molar bear.
Molar bear.
You know what?<br/>I really am done.
Good night, New York.
She really quit.
You think we had anything<br/>to do with that?
Yeah, I think we did.
Nice job, Barney.
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
That was killing my arm.
My arm hasn't been this source<br/>since I was 13 years old
and figured out how<br/>to lock a bathroom.
Up top.
What's wrong?
Well, I officially didn't get that job.
- I'm so sorry.<br/>- That's okay. They...
they offered me another one.
Hey, that's great.<br/>What are you going to be doing?
Foreign correspondent.
I'm, hum...
moving to Japan
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Barney is crazy if he thinks<br/>this is gonna work.
- I think it's gonna work.<br/>- I hope it doesn't work.
Here he comes.
- You there, what's your name?<br/>- Excuse me?
Your name, woman,<br/>what's your name?!
- Cindy.<br/>- I knew it.
You're the Cindy,<br/>the one who can change everything,
or spell our inevitable doom.
Now listen to me, Cindy.
I am Barney Stinson,
and I am on an urgent mission<br/>from the future.
The future?
The future,<br/>and I can prove it to you.
In exactly four seconds,
the woman at that booth<br/>is going to slap that man.
What the hell?
In a few minutes,
the young me from your time<br/>is going to come through that door.
Now, Cindy,<br/>I know this sounds insane,
but in order to save the planet,
You need to sleep with him tonight.
What?
Sleep with Barney Stinson tonight,<br/>in whatever way he wants it,
or he won't be able<br/>to find the solution
to global warming<br/>that saves the human race.
- What are you talking about?<br/>- I have no time to explain.
I have to get back<br/>to the reality accelerator
before the vortex closes.
Only you can save us, Cindy.
I must away!
Okay, guys,<br/>the movers are coming in 14 hours.
We gotta get back upstairs<br/>and finish packing.
You guys still aren't finished packing?
How is this taking so long?
Hey, all the great memories
of our 20s took place<br/>in that apartment.
It's not like throwing stuff in a box.
You start to reminisce.
Not me. The key?
Throw stuff out and never look back.
I'm moving to Japan.<br/>It took me a half hour to pack.
A half hour?
Well, it would have<br/>taken me 20 minutes,
but a friend called me in tears.
Moving is really emotional, okay?
It is.
I mean, everything is changing.
I'm gonna be living in New Jersey<br/>with Stella,
you guys will be in your new place.
You're starting a new job in Tokyo.
It's the end of an era.
I think we should have a toast,<br/>but not our usual crap.
Hey... Wendy, your most<br/>expensive bottle of scotch.
That's 50-year-old Glen McKenna,<br/>and it's $2,500.
Excellent.<br/>A bottle of that with beer chasers,
and what do you think,<br/>cancel the scotch?
Vodka rocks.
It's not gonna work.
Oh, my God!
You're...
Oh, my God!
Can I buy you a drink?
I suppose I have time<br/>for one drink and...
45 minutes to an hour<br/>of some other activity,
but after that,<br/>I have to get back to
a top-secret research project<br/>I'm working on.
Global warming?
My God, how did you know that?
Sync by vNaru
Hey, look at this.
A photo from the first day<br/>we moved into this place.
So many great memories.
See? That is exactly the type of crap<br/>you should be trashing.
So you don't keep any photos?
No, they're like<br/>love letters or yearbooks
or someone's ashes,<br/>they just take up space.
Besides, Stella's not gonna let you<br/>keep half of this junk.
Why wouldn't she?
Ted, oh, sweetie.
Okay, here's the thing that guys
only learn after they move in<br/>with a woman.
All of your stuff is stupid.
Like what?
Like anything you bought<br/>at a Renaissance faire.
There's not enough<br/>mead in the world
to make me get rid of my flail.
Since we're clearly not getting<br/>our security deposit back,
I thought maybe<br/>you could reimburse me for my half.
Wait a second, why should I<br/>have to pay more than you?
Because you treated<br/>this apartment the way
John Bonham treated<br/>his central nervous system.
That's not true.
Exhibit a.
What's that?
A 1986 world book encyclopaedia.
It's exactly the one I grew up with.
Encyclopaedia?
You think it should be pronounced<br/>encyclo-pee-dia.
It's a common mistake.
But if you look at that squished together<br/>"ae" symbol in this here Encyclopaedia,
you'll learn that it's a ligature
derived from the anglo-saxon rune...
You know,<br/>you're gonna have to paedia for that.
But you never did...
and then, there's exhibit b.
Good morrow, fair gentles.
Look what I won<br/>at the renaissance faire.
And you're also responsible<br/>for any damage
Robin did when she was your girlfriend.
What damage did I cause?
Do you remember that night<br/>when you drank the 12'er of Molson
and you got all super canadian?
Stanley cup, game six A.
The Rangers are about to be sorry
They ever played shinny<br/>with the Canucks.
- Hey, hey, Robin.<br/>- Yeah?
I'll give you 20 bucks if you<br/>can shoot it through this front door.
You're nuttier than<br/>a Tim Horton's maple log.
Timmy ho!
That's it, Robin.<br/>Give me the stick.
I'll give you summer teeth.
Some are here, some are there.
Robin, give me the stick.
Take off,
- hoser.<br/>- That's it!
Scrap?! I'll scrap!
- Guys, come on!<br/>- For America.
All right, break it, break it up!
Ted, no!
You never break up<br/>a girl fight!
Never!
Entirely Barney's fault.
As, by the way, is the big<br/>scorch mark over the fireplace.
Kids, to understand the story<br/>of the scorch mark,
I first need to tell you the story of
the intervention<br/>for our friend Stewart.
What's going on?
Stewart, this is an intervention.
The alcohol changes you, Stewart.
It makes you a different person.
And I'm in love<br/>with the man that I married.
Thank you.
This is just the push I need.
I love you guys.
Hey, hey! There's the birthday boy.
Time to let the party monster out<br/>of its cage, Stewie!
Come on, buddy.
People don't want to see<br/>Bruce Banner, dude.
They want to see the hulk.
Hulk, hulk, hulk... what?
That's what I get for skimming<br/>the e-vite.
Later that day, we celebrated<br/>our first successful intervention.
I am really proud of us<br/>for helping Stewart.
Yeah, what an amazing<br/>honest, human moment.
I agree. Yay us.
Marshall, are you really<br/>gonna keep wearing that hat?
Yeah, it's been two weeks, Marshall.
Two awesome weeks...
And heck, yeah,<br/>I'm gonna keep wearing it.
The next day
Marshall,
this is an intervention.
It's about the hat.
I have it under control, okay?
I can take it off<br/>whenever I want to.
Dear Marshall,
I do not like that stupid hat.
I want to beat it with a bat.
Or maybe stab it with a fork.
It makes you look like such a dork.
After that,
Interventions became a pretty<br/>regular thing around our apartment.
Cor blimey.
This is a nice bloody surprise.<br/>What's this about then?
Lily...
It's about the weird<br/>fake english accent.
Bollocks.
Spray tan?
They reel you in with a coupon,<br/>and then you just get hooked.
We know, sweetie, we know.
This is a new sweater.
What?
The magic tricks.
Specifically, those involving fire.
Magic tricks?
Guys, interventions<br/>are supposed to help people,
not attack every little thing<br/>you don't like about them.
I'm sorry, but<br/>that really steams me.
That really burns me up!
I mean, I am filled<br/>with a white-hot rage!
Thank you.
Oh, shoot.<br/>I smell hair! I smell hair!
And that's the story<br/>of the scorch mark.
Wait, that's weird.
When I was going through the closet, I
thought I saw the intervention banner.
So?
So, the banner burned up.<br/>Why is there a new one?
And there are sealed letters here<br/>from all of you that say "Ted."
Were you guys planning<br/>an intervention for me?
That... that was stupid.
Yeah, just, just forget about that.
What was it for? The crocs?
- The hair product?<br/>- Not Stella.
Oh, my God,<br/>this was about Stella.
I just said "not Stella."
So maybe it was about<br/>your poor listening skills, Ted.
- What?<br/>- It's out of control. see?
You guys don't think<br/>I should marry Stella?
You guys don't think<br/>I should marry Stella?
Ted, we do.
We're all really happy for you.
Yeah. Like I said,<br/>it was stupid.
Well, obviously, it wasn't,
Because we agreed not to have<br/>any more stupid interventions
at our intervention intervention.
We're having too many interventions.
So, what was your big,<br/>serious problem with me and Stella?
Yes!
Yes! in everyone's face!
You all said the "future barney" thing<br/>wouldn't work.
You told me I was crazy.
My shrink told me I was crazy.
Well, who's the narcissist<br/>with severe attachment disorder now,
Dr. Grossbard?!
Intervention banner?<br/>What's that for?
"Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."
You've just been carrying that around?
Please, Ted?
"I cannot stand idly by<br/>while you make
the biggest mistake any man can make...
getting married.
"mark my words, this whole thing<br/>is gonna go up in flames!"
Damn!
I put the flame cue too early.
I had so many more<br/>important things to say, and...
The point is, Ted,
marriage is stupid.
Every year, there are a million new
hot 22-year-olds walking into bars,
and call me "glass half full,"
but I think they're getting dumber.
Come on, Barney,
even you aren't still gonna be<br/>hitting on
22-year-olds when you're 80.
- I accept that challenge.<br/>- What challenge?
To prove to you
that I will be exactly<br/>this awesome when I'm 80,
I will hook up with a 22-year-old
while in my old-man makeup.
I didn't remotely challenge<br/>you to that.
I mean, I definitely want to see it.
But I didn't remotely challenge<br/>you to that.
I want to hear the other letters.
Ted, this is ridiculous.
We changed our minds.
And suppose you change them back?
Lily, come on, let's hear yours.
"Gilbert's reading skills<br/>have improved drastically since..."
Wait,
this is a letter I meant to send home<br/>with one of my kindergarteners.
Gilbert,
are things moving too fast
between you and a girl named Stella?
I wish.
Robin, could I hear yours?
"Dear Ted, it's 'encyclo-pee-dia,<br/>not 'encyclo-pay-dia.
Why do you always say things<br/>in the most pretentious way possible?
It makes you sound douchey
and that's 'douchey,<br/>not 'douch-ay.'"
Yeah, you already read that one<br/>at my pronunciation intervention.
Where's the letter about Stella?
I didn't write one...<br/>I'm your ex-girlfriend.
I figured anything I said on the subject<br/>would sound catty.
Plus, I'm hotter than her,<br/>so who cares?
Marshall?
Dude, it's water under<br/>the bridge.
- Please.<br/>- And we just...
"Dear Ted,
Stella seems like a wonderful person.
But you don't know<br/>her well enough to get married,
you certainly don't know her<br/>well enough to
commit to raising<br/>a seven-year-old with her.
You're not doing her,
her child or yourself any favors<br/>by rushing into this.
Just give it some more time."
Dude, that was<br/>months ago, all right?
That was before we got to know Stella<br/>and see how
awesome she is<br/>and what a great couple you guys are.
That's why we decided not<br/>to even have that intervention.
Thank you.
Because I really need you guys<br/>to be on board with this.
And we are.
And we hope<br/>you're not mad at us.
Course not.
I mean, it's not like what<br/>you said was crazy.
You had a lot of valid concerns.
Yeah, but concerns<br/>we have completely moved on from.
But you had a point.
I mean, this whole thing has moved<br/>pretty fast.
Well, you know what?
Maybe that's because...
when it's right, you just know.
Yeah, I guess,<br/>but-but we are still,
you know,<br/>getting to know each other.
And, Lily, maybe you're right.
Maybe Stella won't like any<br/>of my stuff.
Like the robot cookie jar.
This was, like,<br/>the first thing we bought
for this place, remember?
Of course I do.
Marshall,
my sensors indicate<br/>that your pecan sandy levels
are dangerously low.
My collection of James Bond movies.
Remember? We watched them all<br/>in order, and then...
Lily spoke in that weird english accent<br/>for, like, the next month?
- It was sophisticated.<br/>- No.
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.
My elephant lamp.
The english phone booth.
My sombrero!
Ted, what are you doing?
Unpacking.<br/>I'm never leaving this apartment
Ted, stop unpacking.
You're just freaking out.
I'm not ready<br/>for all the responsibility,
and I'm certainly not ready to be<br/>a step-dad
to a seven-year-old.
I mean, if I get married<br/>and move to the suburbs,
in the blink of an eye,<br/>I've become an old man!
Why, hello, young lady.
You want a butterscotch candy?
What do you mean,<br/>"nothing in common"?
We're both seniors.
You're cute.
How old are you?
83.
How old are you?
31.
Okay, Ted has officially snapped.
There are moving men coming<br/>in ten hours.
His fiance is waiting for him<br/>in New Jersey.
We have to do something.
I got this.
Hey, Bud.
Why don't you come here for a minute.
What?
Look, I want you to know<br/>this is all totally normal.
Big transitions can be scary, and<br/>cold feet...
well they're just part of the deal.
So... how about you give me the knife?
Give me the knife.
Come on.
So I can start unpacking, too.
I'm staying here right by your side<br/>forever, buddy!
Marshall!
Lily, our lives have been good here.
That's why we've been putting off<br/>packing.
Because subconsciously,
we both know that it would be<br/>stupid to leave.
It's safe and warm here. There's a...
a bar downstairs,<br/>and a cookie robot in the kitchen.
This is my home,<br/>and I'm never leaving!
Listen to you!
You sound like that fat,<br/>dweeby kid at camp.
"mom, dad, I want to come home.
The cool kids are playing keep-away<br/>with my inhaler."
I can't believe my dad<br/>read that letter at our wedding.
Marshall, you can't do this to Lily.
Yes, I know your new place<br/>has had some problems,
with the slanted floors and<br/>the nearby sewage treatment plant, but
you're gonna turn it into a great home.
Tell him, Lily.
It's a black hole<br/>where dreams go to die.
I'm not moving, either.
- Oh, come on!<br/>- Yes!
Okay, you guys finish unpacking.
I'm gonna go bake some cookies<br/>to fill r2-sweet tooth.
Oh, my god, look at you cowards!
So afraid of any kind of change.
So terrified of anything new.
So desperate
to cling to anything<br/>comfortable and familiar.
I can't move to Japan.
What was I thinking?
It's so far away.<br/>And I don't speak the language.
I didn't even have any good pictures<br/>of you guys.
Sweetie.
Everybody says<br/>change is so great, right?
But what's so great about change?
Hey, who wants to walk down<br/>to our same old bar,
sit in our regular booth<br/>and order the usual?!
Yeah! The usual! My favorite!
Oh, my god.
Well, well, well.
I believe someone owes me $200.
Barney, this was never a bet...<br/>nobody...
This proves that I will be this awesome<br/>when I'm 80.
Arthritis five.
I'm moving to New Jersey.
What?
And you and Marshall should move<br/>to your new place,
and Robin should go to Japan.
Why?
Because we're gonna get older<br/>whether we like it or not,
So the only question is whether<br/>we want to get on with our lives
or desperately cling to the past<br/>and end up like that.
You mean awesome?
I'm 80, dude,<br/>and I'm making out with a 22-year-old.
Take me to your place, cheri.
I want to see your world war 2 medals.
In a minute, mon petite.
All right, so that doesn't count.
What? why?
She's french... that's like<br/>playing tennis with the net down.
You know what?
I'll cover the security deposit.
I'm glad to, because...
Every dent in that place represents<br/>a memory that I'll cherish forever.
But on one condition.
We all put aside ten bucks<br/>every week for the next year,
And we come back here<br/>and we buy that 50-year-old scotch,
And we toast the incredible<br/>life-changing year we've all had.
Get out of our booth.
Me with my new family,
Marshall and Lily<br/>in their new apartment,
and Robin
as the number one english-speaking<br/>journalist in the Pacific rim,
visiting us here in New York<br/>to celebrate this day.
The day we closed<br/>an incredible chapter in our lives,
only to open up a new one.
- I think I left my cell...<br/>- Get out of here.
And one year later,<br/>that's exactly what we did.
And so let's raise a glass<br/>of $2,500 scotch
to one hell of a year.
Amazing.
That's unbelievable.
It's kind of smoky,<br/>with a hint of aged cedar and...
do you guys taste the difference<br/>twince vice and...
- ten-dollar scotch?<br/>- Not at all. no difference.
I want to cut mine with red bull.
Wendy, can you take a picture?
A lot of things<br/>did change that year,
but some things<br/>stayed the same.
So... what do you say<br/>we move this party upstairs
- to the apartement?<br/>- Yeah. Great idea.
What the...?
Barney, this is an intervention.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
All right, enough with<br/>the "old man" bit.
What about the old sand pit?
Let it go.
"let it snow"?
I love that old ditty!
I'm getting my flail.
You're setting sail?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Hey.
Hey, guys, how's it going?
I'm just gonna finish this.
We just had dinner with<br/>Stella's sister and her fiancé.
They're getting married before us.
Okay, you know how you've dreamt<br/>about your perfect wedding day
ever since you were a little girl?
- Yeah.<br/>- Totally.
My sister is stealing<br/>my dream wedding.
Down to every last detail...<br/>on Shelter Island, at Sunset,
...just down the beach from my family's<br/>old summer house.
It's my dream wedding.
I'm gonna finish this.
The lamb here<br/>is supposed to be great.
I'm a vegan.
I wish I could tune out that<br/>moral voice inside me that says
eating animals is murder,
but I guess I'm just not as<br/>strong as you are.
That's 'cause you need protein.
I'll have the lamb.
Okay, new goal:
I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head<br/>and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like, 20 times.
Ted, in high school, you were<br/>her wedding, weren't you?
You know, she's always<br/>trying to one-up me.
I mean, I love her, but...
there's a little part of me
that kinda wishes this whole<br/>thing would just fall apart.
I hate him. I hate him.<br/>I hate him!
God, this steak is so good!
Four days to go<br/>and he just runs off
with the vitamin consultant<br/>from Whole Foods?
I gave up makeup for him.
I gave up showering for him.
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.
Hard to imagine<br/>where it all went wrong.
And now it's so close to the wedding.<br/>There's like...
bacon or something in this<br/>dipping sauce. I love it.
I can't get any refunds.<br/>I'm gonna be out thousands of dollars.
Kids, when you're in a relationship,
you develop a kind of telepathy<br/>with your partner.
What do you think?
We could help her out.
No, Stella,
we should help her out.
Let's pay for dinner.
Nora.
Don't worry.
We got this.
That's right.
We'll take over your wedding,
pay you back for<br/>everything you spent.
Ted and I will get<br/>married this Sunday.
Sync by vNaru
We're getting married this Sunday?
Are we sure we're ready for this?
Ted, I wasted years<br/>trying to get Lucy's dad
to decide he was "ready" for this,
but he never got ready for this.<br/>That's why we never got married.
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.
I used to dream that Tony<br/>would be spontaneous like this.
Okay, I'm in.
And I'm also...
spontaneous.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Kids, morals usually come<br/>at the end of stories,
but this one is so important,<br/>I'm gonna tell you now:
Don't ever, ever,<br/>invite an ex to your wedding.
If someone had given me that advice,
well, it would have changed everything.
Come on, you've got to come,<br/>it's my wedding.
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.
It's my first week on the job.<br/>I can't just take off.
Plus, I'm finally doing serious news.
Robin was doing serious news.
It was the number one<br/>English news network in Japan.
Of course, the news<br/>was a little different over there.
Giant Fan!
The Federal Reserve Board<br/>voted to leave interest...
rates unchanged.
It's my wedding.<br/>You have to be there.
Okay. I'll be there.
I gotta go.
Good evening.
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
Peace talks were stalled<br/>once again in the Middle East.
Despite a promising start<br/>in the latest negotiations,
talks foundered on security issues.
- She's in.<br/>- Yes!
All right, Ted,<br/>your bachelor party, tonight.
I have got three of the most<br/>physically and morally flexible
exotic dancers<br/>you've ever seen...
Can't, there's no time.
Okay, I'll let you know<br/>how it goes.
Marshall, we should really rent<br/>the cars for tomorrow?
Sure.
What?
No "Don't get married, Ted"?
No "You're making a big mistake, Ted"?
Barney Stinson...
are you no longer committed<br/>to the war on marriage?
No, I just know a hopeless<br/>cause when I see it.
It's the same reason<br/>I don't recycle.
Plus, Ted getting married<br/>is in my best interest.
You see...
Lately I've been working on a problem<br/>of the utmost importance.
I confess I was stumped.
Until one night I decided<br/>to tackle it once and for all.
HOW CAN I HAVE SEX<br/>WITH ROBIN AGAIN?
VULNERABLE
NOSTALGIC
BOOZE
Then, at last...
I cracked the code.
GET HER DRUNK<br/>AT TED'S WEDDING
- So you're back on Robin.<br/>- Hopefully.
I mean, this weekend
is the best chance ever<br/>to hook up with her again.
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.
The first drunk<br/>bridesmaid you see,
you'll have your head under her dress<br/>like an old-time photographer.
Lily, don't cheapen this.
I don't want to sound all...
mushy-gushy and romantic,
but this weekend,<br/>Robin is the only woman I'm banging.
And so, the day<br/>before our wedding,
Stella and I made the trip up<br/>to Shelter Island.
With everyone else<br/>not far behind.
- Zitch dog.<br/>- Z-Z-Z... Zog...
This isn't exactly where I pictured<br/>Ted getting married.
"The Namaste Yoga and Meditation<br/>Collective."
I don't know about you guys,
but Nama-stay here<br/>any longer than I have to.
Sweetie, go check<br/>in with that dirty hippie
over there and<br/>we'll get some drinks.
So, what scotches you got?
Here at the center, we have<br/>a very strict no-alcohol policy.
Great, and all the meals<br/>are included, right?
And they're all 100% vegan.
I need alcohol.
I'm not gonna get Robin<br/>with this stuff.
Look at this.
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.
My God, some of these drinks<br/>could actually make a girl smarter.
What sort of hell<br/>has Ted brought us to?
- There's no meat.<br/>- There's no alcohol.
It gets worse:
I'm 90% sure that guy<br/>you were talking with used
to be lead singer of the Spin Doctors.
Hey, guys,
Stella and I have a little problem.
The programs look great.
I mean, it's not our names<br/>on the front, but otherwise,
really nice.
Hey, I talked to Robin.
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here<br/>just under the wire.
You invited Robin?
Yeah, of course.
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Can I help?
You feel glad.
You like Robin.
Yeah, but,<br/>she's your ex-girlfriend.
- It's weird.<br/>- It's not weird.
It is weird.
You don't get what's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.
Stella.
Your new husband used to nail me, like,
three times a day.
Having exes around,
I don't know, it brings up...
unresolved things.
How do you know that spark<br/>won't come back
with your ex sitting out there?
Come on, we're just friends.
Plus, Robin and I already had<br/>our backslide...
last Thanksgiving,<br/>not even that long ago.
Did you place a large bet<br/>against yourself in this argument?
She already got her ticket.
Ted, it's important to me.
I would never invite Lucy's dad.
I wouldn't care if you did.<br/>Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.
No, Tony is the last person<br/>I want at our wedding, okay?
And Robin is a close second.
Robin's probably about to get<br/>on the plane.
Plus, she left a really<br/>important job for this.
Spurred by environmental concerns<br/>and high gasoline prices,
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen<br/>11% over the previous year.
What should I do?
I don't know.
I kinda get the no exes thing.
Why ask a filed romance to come<br/>and watch your successful one?
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners<br/>to a World Series game.
It's weird for everyone.
What? No.<br/>Robin has to come.
Right, she's like, my best friend.
Female friend.<br/>My best female friend.
Hey! Whoa! I don't care, why fake it.
Dude, Robin has to be here.
She shouldn't come.
- What are you talk...<br/>- Justice Aldrin,
tie-breaking vote.
Okay, wouldn't feel right<br/>without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.
I'm gonna tell her not to come.
- No, Ted.<br/>- It's the right decision, Ted.
This is gonna be, like, the worst
phone conversation of all time.
Ted, Ted, Ted.
Co-best man...<br/>I'm on it.
Hello?
Robin, where are you?
Just heading to the airport.
Okay, well, see you soon.<br/>Have a great flight.
Bad news.<br/>I couldn't reach her.
Robin's already in on her way.
Okay, Robin's on her way.
You know what, I'm glad.
Exes should be allowed<br/>to come to weddings.
I'll just tell Stella<br/>she's got to deal with it.
I think you need to be more delicate
with Stella about<br/>this whole Robin thing.
What do you mean by delicate?
Brides are under a lot of stress<br/>before a wedding.
I mean, of course,<br/>I held it together pretty well.
You don't remember?
The florist just told me
the roses are more light medium-pink<br/>than medium-pink.
Light medium-pink!
Everything's ruined.
Our wedding site uses a gravity furnace
instead of forced-air heating.
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?
Blobbity-blah. Wickity-wah.<br/>Eeky, eeky, eeky, eeky whee!
After a while, it's all noise.
Poor Stella's had to jam
months of crazy into just three days.
So what do I do?
You wait for the next crisis,
you solve it, you're a hero.
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time, she'll say yes.
Yeah, but what if there's<br/>no next crisis?
She's a bride.<br/>There will be a next crisis.
Like four minutes later
- There's an next crisis.<br/>- Awesome! What is it?
My daughter, my own daughter<br/>isn't coming to our wedding.
What?
Tony's supposed to drive<br/>her up tomorrow,
but now he's being all petty<br/>about me getting married,
and he won't do it.
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?
So first thing tomorrow<br/>I drive down,
talk to him,<br/>get him to let me drive Lucy up,
than, boom, crisis solved.
Stella's happy.<br/>Robin comes to the wedding.
Hey.
You Barney?
Yes.
I hear you're a real man whore,<br/>so listen up.
Tomorrow night I want to do things<br/>so dirty and so depraved
that I forget that this<br/>was supposed to be my wedding.
I... I'm kind of here with someone.
Bring her.
You're never going to make it.
So, the morning of my wedding day<br/>I made the trip back
to Tony's house
to get Lucy.
- Hey...<br/>- Tony...
Doing a little karate?
Sorry, sorry, man.<br/>You just...
set off my internal defense alarm.
You got to watch these things.<br/>Stay alert, stay alive.
- Right.<br/>- So what brings you here?
I thought you'd be off<br/>in some honeymoon suite
with my woman right now.
Not yet. Soon.
That's right, tonight's the night.
Yeah! Oh, man, you are going to be<br/>sticking it
to the mother of my child.
Actually, I' already<br/>stuck it to her plenty of times.
Why do I always have to correct people?
You and Stella.
You lucky dog.<br/>I could just...
I'm so happy for you guys.
Yeah... listen, here's the thing...
- Lucy...<br/>- You can't take her.
Tony, stop. Look...
this is a big day for Lucy, too.
You're going to have to put<br/>aside your own issues
and think about<br/>what's best for her here.
Whether you like it or not,
she really should be<br/>at her mother's wedding. So,
I'm taking Lucy with me.
You're right, man.
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br/>It's just...
seeing you guys...
has made me realize everything I had.
Hey, hey... let's stop hugging.
I'm sorry.
Lucy means the world to me.
And I feel like I'm losing her<br/>to this new family...
a family I'm not even a part of.
Come on, sure you are.
No, I'm not. I wasn't even invited<br/>to the wedding.
Well, you are now.
Road trip.
Right?
Road Trip 2...<br/>Back in the Car.
So, today's the day.
You hydrating?
Dear femal, thank you for your interest<br/>in Barney Stinson...
Your back is going to look like<br/>a Jackson Pollock.
I regret to inform you<br/>that at this time...
I was a vegan for two years.
I need meat.
There are<br/>currently no positions available.
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.
Your room, 20 minutes.
No foreplay.
I'm not going to make it, am I?
Not a chance.
Okay, just remember,
Let me talk to Stella first, okay?
Mommy! Mommy!
Ted invited daddy!
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.
Give me just a sec, okay?
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.<br/>- You invited Tony?
To our wedding?!
Ted, we talked about this.<br/>No exes at our wedding.
Why would you do this?
Oh boy! What did Ted do this time?
Ted, what is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.
No exes at our wedding.
To be fair...
your ex is here.
You invited him!
- Come on, it's not weird.<br/>- It is weird.
It's like things are not<br/>finished between you two.
And Tony...
I can't talk with Tony right now.
Can you please go out there<br/>and tell him to leave?
You can make me the bad guy.
I'll go talk to Robin, so she<br/>knows it's nothing personal.
And kids, if I had just let<br/>Stella talk to Robin,
this whole story<br/>might have ended differently.
I understand.
I get it.
For the first time,<br/>Ted and Stella Mosby.
And that's how I met your mother.
Is your dad finally done yakking?
Now, come on,<br/>who wants ice cream?
But I didn't.
Look, can you talk to Tony?
Robin flew all the way here<br/>from Tokyo.
I should talk to her.
Sure.
- Hi.<br/>- Hey.
- Sorry about running off like that.<br/>- Oh, it's okay.
You would not believe<br/>the trip I just had.
I was on a plane<br/>for almost a full day.
But it is worth it<br/>to see you get married.
How could I not be here...?
- You can't come to the wedding.<br/>- Oh, thank God!
- What?<br/>- Ted, it's weird.
- It's not weird.<br/>- It is weird.
Do you know how it feels<br/>to be somebody's ex at their wedding?
- Robin.<br/>- Stella.
Suck it, bitch!<br/>I win!
We broke up over a year ago.
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.
Watching your marry
another woman isn't exactly<br/>something I was looking forward to.
I don't know, I
I just thought if I ever<br/>changed my mind about
marriage and kids, it was...
it was nice to know<br/>that you were there.
So, I was your safety school...
- how flattering.<br/>- Not that...
That's not it. It's just that...
Why are you bringing any of this up?
There's nothing between us anymore.
Well, maybe there is.
I mean, of course there is.<br/>That kind of stuff just...
doesn't disappear without a trace.
Look, I'm not just<br/>another guest here, Ted.
Right.
We used to date, but
we both moved on.<br/>And... look,
we got what we wanted...<br/>I'm getting married,
you got your dream job in Tokyo.
- And they all lived happily ever...<br/>- I quit my job.
- You what?<br/>- I'm moving back to New York.
I thought I wanted that job, but...
I want to come back to my real life.
And I think you should go back<br/>to yours.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't get married.
Look, you're rushing into this.
It's like you're trying
to skip ahead to the end of the book.
Ted, you're the most romantic guy<br/>I know. You...
You stole a blue French horn for me.
You tried to make it rain.
- I did make it rain.<br/>- It was a coincidence.
But after all that,<br/>this is how your great
romantic quest comes to an end?
You're just disappearing<br/>into someone else's wedding,
someone else's
house, someone else's life<br/>without a second thought.
That's not the amazing ending<br/>that you deserve.
That's not Ted Mosby.
I love Stella.
She's the one.
If you really feel that way...
I guess it's a good thing you're not<br/>coming to the wedding after all.
- Big fight?<br/>- Yeah.
Here...
It's on the house.
Just keep 'em coming.
Oh God, do not keep them coming.
Hey, Robin.
Barney.
I am having a horrible day.
I snuck some scotch in from<br/>the duty free store.
You want to join me?
Yeah, yeah.<br/>Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.<br/>And we can knock it back.
They didn't get me a room.
I was actually hoping<br/>I could stay with you.
No problem.
I just have to<br/>straighten up little bit.
I've got some clothes<br/>on the floor, and...
And a naked girl<br/>tied to your headboard.
Towels all over the bathroom.<br/>It's a mess.
So, anyway...<br/>give me ten minutes
- to get the place in order...<br/>- See ya, Barney.
Okay, let's do this.
Who the hell is that?
It's the girl from the front desk.
Kids, sometimes you think<br/>you're living out one story,
but the truth turns out<br/>to be something else entirely.
At the time I thought the story
was about whether Robin<br/>should be at the wedding.
If only I'd understood<br/>what the real story was.
Having exes around...
I don't know, brings up...
unresolved things.
How do you know that that spark<br/>won't come back
with your ex sitting out there?
It's like things<br/>are not finished between you two.
I wasted years trying to get Lucy's dad
to decide if he was ready for this.
Seeing you guys...
it's made me alize everything I had.
I used to dream that Tony would be<br/>spontaneous like this.
Seriously, kids,
never invite an ex
to your wedding.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids,<br/>the day you get married
is supposed to be<br/>the happiest day of your life.
The perfect ending to a perfect love story.
My wedding, at least my first wedding,<br/>didn't go so well.
Say that I'm changed
Say I'm different
Maybe I finally understand
Say I've let go
It's funny, looking back on it now.<br/>I was so sure Stella was the one.
And when she left me,<br/>I was so devastated.
But you guys got me through it.<br/>And now the painful part's over.
I've come out the other side<br/>a little bit stronger.
You know, I hardly<br/>even think about her anymore.
That's what time does, I guess.
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.<br/>It's been 24 hours.
I know. And this is me moving on.
A great new chapter of my life<br/>began today, and we're gonna celebrate.
Right now, we need two things.<br/>We need Kool and we need the Gang.
It's jukebox time, huh?
I look at that young man
popping and locking his way<br/>over to the jukebox
and I think to myself, "You know,<br/>maybe Stella made the right call. "
Ow! Pain.
What? How is he dancing right now?
He should be smashing up Stella's car<br/>with a sledgehammer.
Hypothetical.<br/>Ted isn't pretending to be happy.
Ted really is happy. He never wanted<br/>to get married in the first place.
Ted just pulled off the greatest<br/>train dodge since Stand by Me.
Well, not the first kid, but the other kids.
No, he is in bad shape.
What's up?
Really bad shape.<br/>And we need to be there for him.
But as much as my friends<br/>really wanted to be there for me,
I was, by all appearances, fine.
- Hey, buddy.<br/>- Want to hang out?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?<br/>- I'm fine.
- Hey, kiddo.<br/>- Barney, I'm fine.
This is not necessary,<br/>and it's actually kind of weird.
- No offense, ladies.<br/>- I did not realize you'd be home.
Ladies, to the stairwell.
Finally, after two weeks,<br/>the inevitable emotions boiled over.
- Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?<br/>- Oh, shut up.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's just, Ted, you've been through<br/>something traumatic,
and we're trying to be there for you<br/>as friends, but you're not letting us,
and it's pissing us off,<br/>you selfish bitch. Sorry.
Look, we're just worried that you're not<br/>dealing with this whole Stella thing.
Okay, now, do you remember<br/>when Lily left me?
You remember how I held in my feelings?
I miss her so much.
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.
Well, I should have been even worse,<br/>okay? I should have gotten mad.
I should have taken your advice<br/>and set all of Lily's stuff on fire.
Oh. Nice. Thanks, Ted.
But I didn't, and I think that that's why<br/>it took me so long to get better.
So, now, Ted, I want you to explode.
Release the berserker. Okay, you ready?
Now!
- I'm good.<br/>No.
Guys, get off his back. He's happy.
Listen, if Ted were married right now,
he'd be married,<br/>he'd be living in New Jersey,
and he'd be married.
He's fine. Now, let's eat.<br/>How about Flat Michael's?
No, that's 44th and Lex. Can't do it.
- Why not?<br/>- It's too close to Stella's gym.
Might run into her. Anywhere else, though.
Okay, how about Hurley's?
Right between Stella's office<br/>and her dry cleaners. No, sir.
Well, what about Meatloaf Charlie's?
Two blocks<br/>from Stella's mother's hairdressers.
Well, jeez, Ted, is there anywhere<br/>in Manhattan we can go to dinner?
Of course. Check this out.
- What you got there, Ted?<br/>- A little reference map I made for myself.
A New York guide to places<br/>you might run into Stella Zinman.
Red areas are places to avoid.<br/>White areas are safe. Blue is water.
- That is just ridiculous.<br/>- Well, water is blue.
You can't live that way.
She leaves you at the altar<br/>and you're the one avoiding her?
Yes, I'm avoiding her.
What's the big deal? That's how we do it.
Who's "we"? Gutless weenies?
No, "we" is people<br/>from the great state of Ohio.
When life gives us pain, we Buckeyes<br/>take that pain and we push it down.
And if the pain starts to come up again,<br/>we push more pain down on top of it.
Why confront something<br/>when you can avoid it, right?
All I have to do is never see Stella again,<br/>and I'll live a long, happy life.
Now, who wants to get something to eat?
Oh. Somebody just told me about<br/>a tapas place that's in the white zone.
Great. Let's go there.
- You ready to order?<br/>- Not quite yet.
Can we get some of<br/>those almonds for the table?
Certainly.
Nice call, Lily. This place looks great.
- Who told you about it?<br/>- You know, I don't remember.
Uh-oh.
- What?<br/>- I just remembered.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br/>Okay, okay, just be cool.
We're just gonna have to deal with this.<br/>Everyone, follow my lead.
- Oh, you're kidding.<br/>- Is he serious?
I am not getting under this table.<br/>I'd maybe get under that table.
She's turning around.
Think, think, think.
Everyone, just stay here.<br/>I'm gonna go take a look.
Marshall, go take a look.
- And will you need utensils?<br/>- No, I'm just going straight home.
She's placing an order to go.
Did she seem happy?<br/>Did she say anything about me?
I don't care. I don't even care.<br/>Where are those almonds?
Gosh, where would Ted's nuts be?
Hey, why don't you check<br/>the vise in Stella's garage?
Go yell at her.
Ted, you may be from Ohio,<br/>but you live in New York now.
We don't push down<br/>our feelings in New York.
We take our feelings and<br/>we shove them in somebody else's face!
Spare me, Lily.
You'd be doing the same thing<br/>if you were in this situation.
That's outrageous.
There is not a person on Earth<br/>I would hide under a table from.
Really, not a single person?<br/>Not even Gasser?
- How dare you mention that name to me.<br/>- Who's Gasser?
He's the last person I'd want to see<br/>walk through that door.
Michael Sasser.<br/>He's a guy I went to high school with.
Michael sat next to me<br/>in freshman biology.
He had been a bit of a loser<br/>all through middle school.
But the summer before ninth grade,
he grew 12 inches<br/>and joined the baseball team.
He was right on the precipice<br/>of becoming one of the cool kids.
Until one day...
Lily, we've all been there.<br/>When you've ripped one, it's not pretty.
What did you do?
Are you kidding? This was ninth grade.<br/>I only had one choice.
Oh, my God, Sasser. Fart much?
- No, it wasn't me. It was her.<br/>- Oh! As if, Sasser.
More like Gasser.
- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!<br/>- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!
- No.<br/>- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!
I'm on the baseball team. I'm cool.
Gasser! Gasser!
The nickname Gasser stuck.
He got teased so much,<br/>eventually he had to change schools.
- Kids are awesome.<br/>- I've always felt awful about that.
But if Gasser... Michael<br/>walked in right now,
as hard as it would be,<br/>I would go up to Gasser... Michael
and I would resolve things between us.
Right, clear the air, as it were.
Oh, man.
Those don't come around often.<br/>Y'all are welcome.
- Hey, are you guys okay?<br/>- Oh. Yeah.
We're just gonna be eating down here<br/>if that's okay.
- What?<br/>- Well, here's your almonds.
Oh. Thanks.
- You guys have any specials tonight?<br/>- Ted, this is ludicrous.
Ted, I am a person who...<br/>Well, let's just face it.
There are a lot of people<br/>I don't want to see,
people of the chicks-I-banged persuasion.
But if any of them were to walk in here,<br/>I would stand up
and I would look them right in the eye.<br/>Some of them for the very first time.
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?
Uh-uh.
- Not even, say, Becca DeLucci?<br/>- You son of a bitch.
- Who's Becca DeLucci?<br/>- Do you mind?
So, who is Becca DeLucci?
Becca is just this girl who lives upstate.<br/>I used to visit her now and again.
Mmm-hmm.<br/>Where exactly upstate, Barney?
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.
And yes, the visits<br/>were of a conjugal nature.
- No. No way, really?<br/>- Really.
And what I had with Becca<br/>was a perfect relationship.
She was only allowed, by law,<br/>to call me once a week.
If she ever got clingy,<br/>the armed guards stopped her.
And I never had to pay for dinner.<br/>Well, that's not true. I pay taxes.
Then again, I guess we all paid for dinner.<br/>Thanks a lot, guys.
Anyway, the last time I visited,<br/>I kind of screwed things up.
I know it's hard, baby,<br/>but I'm in a prison, too.
A prison of my own heart.
Is that room ready yet or what?<br/>Can we... Tick-tock.
Barney, you're the only thing<br/>that's keeping me going here.
That's what I'm here for, baby.<br/>I'm your rock.
I'm... Oh, my God. Hello, strange.
Hi, Barney Stinson, attorney at law.<br/>Let's talk about getting you off.
Oh, hell, no!
Whoa!
Ooh.
Now I get letters from Becca and she's all,
"I'm coming to get you<br/>the day I get out of here.
"I'm gonna hang your eyes<br/>from my rearview mirror. "
Women, huh?
See? You're scared of Becca.<br/>Lily's scared of Gasser.
We're staying under the table.
- We don't have to. Stella's gone.<br/>- Oh, my gosh.
There, all done,<br/>and that's how we do it Ohio-style.
Problem showed up. We avoided it.<br/>It went away.
Now we can enjoy our meal in peace...
She's back.
Ted, we all think that you need...<br/>Wait, where's Barney?
Ted, we all think<br/>that you need to go talk to her.
- I don't.<br/>- What?
Yeah, if the last person I wanted to see<br/>walked through the door,
I wouldn't say a damn word.
- Really?<br/>- And who's that?
My father.
You guys, that other table is off the hook.
- What are we talking about?<br/>- Robin's dad.
I haven't spoken to him in three years
- and I don't intend to start now.<br/>- Why?
It goes back<br/>to the day I was born.
You give me my son now. Push.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
He wanted a son and the fact<br/>that I was a girl didn't change his plan.
What do you mean?
My full legal name is<br/>Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.
And it only gets worse from there.
When I was eight,<br/>he took me hunting for the first time.
- I don't want to shoot a deer.<br/>- Nonsense, R.J.
- Shooting deer is the noblest of pursuits.<br/>- But they're cute.
You said the same thing about our rabbits.<br/>Remember how delicious they were?
- Over the years, as my body developed...<br/>- Hold on a sec.
Sorry, go on.
It became harder and harder for him<br/>to pretend I was a boy.
The lowest moment came<br/>when I turned 14.
My peewee hockey team<br/>had just won the Squamish invitational
and everyone came back<br/>to my house to celebrate.
You lads availed yourself splendidly<br/>out there on the ice.
Splendidly. You go on outside.
I'll come back with an assortment<br/>of soft drinks and American pretzels.
Hey, I can't believe you missed<br/>that last empty-netter, you hoser.
- You're the hoser.<br/>- No, you're the hoser.
What are you doing?
You're teammates, hockey players.
Teammates don't kiss!<br/>Hockey players don't kiss!
Oh, my God.
I have no son.
You poor thing.
To have to grow up in Canada<br/>with America right there.
That sucks about your dad, Robin,<br/>but congratulations on that game.
And Kyle and I<br/>weren't even doing anything serious.
- We only went to the blue line.<br/>- The blue line?
Yeah, you know how when you're a kid,<br/>you put everything into hockey terms?
The blue line is kissing,<br/>the red line is getting naked,
and I think "in the crease"<br/>speaks for itself.
Anyway, after that, my relationship<br/>with my dad pretty much went north.
I moved in with my mom,<br/>grew my hair out,
became a Canadian pop star.<br/>You know, normal teen stuff.
Don't you think it would feel better<br/>to talk to him about all this?
No, that's the point.<br/>It wouldn't solve anything.
It's in the past. It's done.<br/>I mean, what would I even say to him?
"I wish you hadn't raised me as a boy?
"I wish you hadn't taught me how to hunt
"and fish and smoke cigars<br/>and drink Scotch
"because that's not what girls do.
"And you know,<br/>the reason I throw like a girl, Dad,
"is because I am a girl. "
You've held on to that<br/>for a long time, huh?
Yeah.
It really messed you up.
Yeah.
- That sucks.<br/>- I'm sorry.
That's hot.
And then I realized...
All of my friends were haunted,
but there was a difference<br/>between my ghost and theirs.
It wasn't too late for me.
- I'm gonna go talk to her.<br/>- All right, bud.
- She's gone. I'm going after her.<br/>- Go, go.
There she goes! Taxi!
Okay, I see her.<br/>She's two cabs ahead on the right.
Just stay with her, okay?
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.<br/>You're gonna confront her.
- Yes, I am gonna confront her.<br/>- Yeah.
- This is so exciting.<br/>- Totally.
What are you going to say?
I'm gonna say, "Stella,<br/>I'm sorry things didn't work out. "
- No!<br/>- Yes.
We're going to talk about this like adults.
She can tell me her side<br/>and I'm going to listen.
Probably should have done<br/>a little more of that before.
Driver, can you run us<br/>into the nearest lamppost?
Everyone, buckle up. Not you, Ted.
Ted, Ted, you gotta get mad right now.<br/>Come on. Dig deep.
Dude, come on.<br/>This isn't about me waving my arms,
stamping my feet, and getting really mad.
This is about Stella and I<br/>finally communicating.
- I mean, clearly, that was...<br/>- Stella hated Star Wars.
She lied to you.
Search your feelings, Ted.<br/>You know it to be true.
- Well, that's her business.<br/>- Come on, Ted. She left you at the altar.
- I don't understand!<br/>- Ted, in the name of all that is sacred...
Wait, wait, wait!
Where is she going? Her cab just missed<br/>the turn for the Lincoln Tunnel.
Why would anybody buy takeout food
and bring it all the way back<br/>to New Jersey anyway?
- Maybe she's going to her office.<br/>- No.
The waiter asked her,<br/>"And will you need utensils?"
And then she said,<br/>"No, I'm just going straight home. "
But if she's going home,<br/>why are we still heading...
Oh, my God.
Tony lives downtown.<br/>Home is Tony's apartment.
She was gonna make me<br/>move to New Jersey,
and then she moves into the city<br/>with Tony?
- Son of a bitch!<br/>- Finally. Finally, buddy.
- I am so angry right now!<br/>- I know, and I love it!
Yeah, that is awesome!
Sir, we'd be happy to cover<br/>the cost of that window crank.
- I love angry Ted!<br/>- So do I!
- Let it out, baby. Let it out.<br/>- She's stopping.
- It is on. It is on!<br/>- Yes, Ted.
- Go get her, buddy!<br/>- Go get rid of your demons!
My leg is asleep!
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on.<br/>- Lily, what are you doing?
No, no, no. This is all right, hold on.
Look, Ted, it's great<br/>that you're angry right now...
- It sure is.<br/>- Yes.
And that you're finally dealing with this,<br/>but you only get one shot here.
Let's just take a beat<br/>and think about what you're gonna say.
I know exactly what I'm gonna say.<br/>Yeah.
You picked the wrong guy.
Ted.
You picked the wrong guy.
You made a really, really,<br/>really bad choice.
What were you thinking? That guy?<br/>Are you kidding me?
Have you learned nothing<br/>in the last eight years?
You're just gonna regret this.<br/>You know that, right?
You are going to regret this,
and now<br/>there is nothing you can do about it
because it's too late.
All you can do now is go up there<br/>and start your crappy, disappointing life
that will never be nearly as happy<br/>as the one you could have had with me.
Goodbye.
- Ted, wait.<br/>- Look, Stella,
I am not here to win you back.
I am here because I need to know<br/>that you know
- you made the biggest mistake of your life.<br/>- I know.
Good.
That's what I'm gonna say.
- Cold-blooded.<br/>- Yeah, that's good.
Go say that.
Thanks.
So I got out of the cab,<br/>ready to say all of that stuff,
ready to explode, but then...
- Mommy!<br/>Hey.
Hi, sweetie.<br/>Me first. Me first.
It all just went away.
And that was it.<br/>In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.
I could see Stella<br/>was meant to be with Tony.
Kids, you may think your only choices<br/>are to swallow your anger
or throw it in someone's face.
But there's a third option,<br/>you can just let it go.
And only when you do that<br/>is it really gone,
and you can move forward.
And that, kids, was the perfect ending<br/>to a perfect love story.
It just wasn't mine.<br/>Mine was still out there waiting for me.

[<div class="full-script">I am not impressed with<br/>the talent in here tonight.
And the more I drink,<br/>the less attractive they get.
I'm one scotch and soda away<br/>from the Cantina scene in Star Wars.
What about those girls over there,<br/>they're hot.
- They're not hot.<br/>- Are you kidding?
I hated their guts the minute I saw<br/>them, which mean they're hot.
In fact, I hated them almost as much<br/>as I hated Robin when I first met her.
- You hated me?<br/>- A lot.
Barney, they're hot.
Oh, there is so much to teach you all.
You have just become victims of...
The Cheerleader Effect.<br/>Glad you asked.
The Cheerleader Effect is when<br/>a group of women seems hot,
but only, as a group.
Just like with cheerleaders.
They seem hot,
but take each one of|them individually?
Sled dogs.
That's insane.
Take a good, hard look at each<br/>one of those girls. Individually.
I don't know.
The one on the end is kind of cute.
Yeah, she really is.
And that, my friends, is<br/>The Cheerleader Effect.
Also known as<br/>the Bridesmaid Paradox,
Sorority Girl Syndrome,
and for a brief window<br/>in the mid-'90s,
the Spice Girls Conspiracy.
Scary Spice indeed.
Barney Stinson.
Oh, hi.
Got it.
Great, we'll be in touch.
What?
Apparently I'm gonna be a dad.
Sync by vNaru
What do you mean you're gonna be<br/>a dad? How did, how did this happen?
It was just some girl I hooked up with<br/>a few weeks back.
She's not sure. She's gonna go<br/>to the doctor in the morning.
Maybe it's a false alarm.<br/>Maybe she's not pregnant.
Lily,
no part of Barney Stinson<br/>does anything less than 110%.
If one of my little<br/>Michael Phelpses got loose,
he's swimming for the gold.
This is a nightmare.
I don't want kids.
Who in their right mind<br/>would ever want kids?
Now, when you turn 30<br/>and you're in a couple,
a strange thing happens.
You start to see<br/>babies everywhere.
Oh, come on.
Yes, Marshall and Lily were<br/>coming down with baby fever.
And their new neighbors<br/>weren't helping.
Did you lose a sock there,<br/>little dude?
That is without a doubt
the cutest little thing<br/>I've ever seen.
There's my little peanut.
That night they sat down to have<br/>a serious practical discussion
about having kids.
So, if we have a baby,
do you think you could<br/>work fewer hours?
Doesn't matter, he's gonna be so cute,<br/>I'm gonna eat him up on the first day.
But what about money?<br/>We're still in a ton of debt.
Oh, well, we'll count our overdue<br/>bills on his teeny tiny fingers.
Let's have a baby.
Oh, oh, right now?<br/>Oh, okay.
There was just<br/>one thing in their way.
Scooch over.<br/>I TiVo'd The View.
And that thing happened to be<br/>unemployed and sleeping on their couch.
So, Robin,
how's the job and<br/>apartment search going?
You didn't hear?
I'm the lead anchor on CNN.
And I got a penthouse overlooking<br/>Central Park made of gold.
Get your head out of<br/>your ass, Marshall.
They realized if they were<br/>going to start a family
they had to plan ahead.
Would you mind crashing<br/>at Ted's tomorrow night?
I'm, uh, cooking,<br/>Marshall a special dinner.
Just dinner.<br/>That's it. Nothing else.
Fine.
But you'd better not be<br/>as uptight as these idiots
about me shooting beer cans<br/>on the roof.
"It hurts my ears.
The neighbors called the cops.<br/>You almost hit me."
Enjoy her, Ted. She's in a real<br/>good place right now.
God? It's me.
Barney.
What up?
I know we don't talk much,
though a lot of girls call out<br/>your name because of me.
Awesome.
But, God...
if you could get me,<br/>out of this,
I swear
I will never
ever, ever, ever,<br/>ever, ever, ever, ev...
Oh, hang on, bro.
Go for Barney.
Really?
Marshall, great news!
I'm not a father!
Congratulations, buddy.
This is the happiest moment<br/>of my life, Marshall.
The way I feel<br/>about not having kids?
I never knew I could love<br/>something this much.
That's why<br/>I'm creating a holiday.
From now on, today will be known<br/>as "Not a Father's Day."
You're creating a holiday?
Yeah, why not?<br/>Everyone else gets a day:
Mothers, Fathers, Bastilles.
Why can't there be a day for people<br/>who are single and like it that way?
Well, now you just sound like<br/>the chubby girl on Valentine's Day.
- Hello, Stinson.<br/>- Hey, Nolan. How are the kids?
You ready for tonight, Eriksen?<br/>Big merger.
Well, that's between me<br/>and my wife, sir.
No. The meeting with Mr. Li.<br/>Tonight.
I thought that was<br/>a breakfast meeting.
It is. Breakfast in China. We're<br/>teleconferencing with the Chinese.
Count on you, kid.
Marshall?
Hey, babe.
- It's breakfast time in China.<br/>- Yeah, it is.
Not a euphemism.<br/>Look, I...
- Wait, what would that even mean?<br/>- I don't know,
hot buns, spicy pork?<br/>There's something there.
You're not coming home tonight,<br/>are you?
Are you shaking your head "no?"
I thought so.
Oh, thank you, guys,<br/>for coming over so fast.
Are you all right?<br/>You sounded upset on the phone.
Marshall and I made<br/>this big decision to have...
dinner.
And I thought<br/>I was ready to have...
dinner.
But then he called<br/>and canceled, and...
it got me thinking.<br/>Is it too early for us to have...
dinner?
I had an early lunch,<br/>so I'm ready for dinner.
- Dinner is a baby!<br/>- Lily, that's horrible!
No, no, I...
I need you guys to figure<br/>something out for me.
What?
Are Marshall and I ready<br/>to have a baby?
So, are Marshall and I ready<br/>to have a baby or not?
Lily, we can't make this decision<br/>for you. It's huge.
You know what else is huge?<br/>Marshall's head.
That thing's the size of a late<br/>August watermelon.
Marshall's baby coming<br/>through there?
What does Marshall think?
Probably lot in that 1950s space helmet<br/>of a head he's walking around with.
Marshall's really excited.
But I think he only sees<br/>what's cute about having a baby,
not what's hard about it.
Like the other day, while Marshall<br/>was playing with baby Jeremy,
I was talking to Jeremy's mom.
Thanks so much for inviting us over.
I have not talked to another<br/>adult in, like, weeks.
Well, besides my husband.
But "It's your turn to change him"<br/>and "Make him shut up"
really doesn't<br/>count as conversation.
Sorry, I'm rambling. I haven't<br/>gotten laid in seven months.
Oh, I just did it again!
Sleep deprivation!
Oh, wait, I'm not crying, am I?
I usually am.
I don't mean to complain.<br/>Oh, now I feel bad!
Oh, there's my little peanut!
Oh, I love you so much!
I'm going to be as<br/>strung out as Charlotte.
Worse actually.
At least her husband<br/>works from home.
I mean, he's a pot dealer,<br/>but he's a very involved parent.
Marshall will be a great dad.
Marshall's always<br/>at the office, and,
and I'm afraid that if<br/>we have a baby now,
all the work will fall on me.
You're just panicking and<br/>focusing on the downside.
I think Lily's just being realistic.
See, this is good. This is why<br/>I called you guys both over here.
Ted, you're pro kids.<br/>Robin, you're against.
Counselors, opening statements.
Okay, I know you're afraid<br/>that you're not ready.
But no one ever thinks<br/>they're ready.
You just have to take the leap.<br/>Parenthood will come naturally.
Well, of course you think<br/>it comes naturally.
You're basically a dad already.
You're a total dad.
What are you talking about?
Ted, think about it.
You tell super corny dad jokes.
Shredded tweet!
Oh, man!
Shredded tweet.
You lecture us. Like when we broke<br/>your stupid ship in a bottle.
I'm not angry.<br/>I'm just disappointed.
- She did it!<br/>- Shut up!
And you do that thing<br/>all dads do with waitresses.
Hi, I'm Lori.<br/>I'll be your waitress this evening.
Hi, Lori, I'm Ted.<br/>I'll be your customer this evening.
Hey, Lori,<br/>before you go, tell me,
what do you get when you cross<br/>a canary with a lawn mower?
No hints.<br/>No hints.
She's right. Ted, you maybe<br/>single and childless,
but you're totally a dorky dad.
I don't think I like<br/>your tone, young lady.
Marshall,<br/>Not a Father's Day is a hit!
Laraby and Finklestein are<br/>helping me celebrate. Check it.
"World's Greatest Not A Dad" mugs.
There's, uh... ha!<br/>"Who's Not Your Daddy?" Tee-shirts.
Oh, check out the greeting cards.
"For everything you do for yourself,
For all the scotch upon your shelf,
Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway,<br/>Here's wishing you
an all night three-way.<br/>Happy Not a Father's Day."
Check out the illustration.

Yes.<br/>Because on Not a Father's Day,
you get a Thai you'd actually wear.<br/>Wordplay five!
She's really kicking<br/>your ass here, Mosby.
Your only hope<br/>is to go negative.
Okay.
I'll tell you why my opponent<br/>is saying all this.
Three words,
- scared of babies.<br/>- What?
- That is crazy. I am not.<br/>- Oh, yeah?
Remember that time you met<br/>my cousin and her kid?
She is so cute!
Oh, do you want to hold her?
Or the baby shower Lily threw<br/>for her friend Erika?
Are you leing<br/>that baby sniff you?
I don't want to get bitten.
And don't forget about...
- Talking baby commercial?<br/>- Talking baby commercial.
But you're not like that, Lily.<br/>You love kids and they love you.
Yes, I'm loveable,<br/>pretty and wise, but is it enough?
Look, it all comes down<br/>to one word, you.
Are you ready to put your own<br/>dreams on the back burner?
Grad school,<br/>teaching art at the college level?
Look, you need to focus<br/>on Project Lily before
you can start Project Baby.
If you don't,<br/>you'll always regret it.
And that wouldn't be fair to you<br/>or the baby.
What's that?
It's Jeremy's sock.
I'm having a baby.
But what about all the things<br/>I just said?
But, but sock.
But what about Marshall<br/>working all the time?
But sock.
But Project Lily!
Little fishies on it.
We made all of these arguments,<br/>and a sock
is what makes your<br/>decision for you?
I guess that was the sock-out punch,<br/>huh, Robin?
- Shut up, Dad.<br/>- You shut up, baby hater.
Babies are scary, okay?<br/>They have giant eyes.
And then, come on, the soft spot?
If there's gonna be<br/>a self-destruct button,
at least hide it somewhere<br/>it won't accidentally get pressed.
Where's Lily?
- Hey, did you drink any of this?<br/>- Not a drop.
Me, neither.
Eriksen, meeting in five minutes.
And you'd better bring<br/>your A-game for Mr. Li.
That guy haunts my nightmares.
Anyway, have fun out there, kid.
Put a baby in me, Marshall.
I'm ready.
Lily... Lily,<br/>what are you doing here?
I'm ready, Marshall.<br/>Tonight's the night.
Put your melon-headed spawn<br/>in my belly.
- What?<br/>- Yeah!
Come on, right now.<br/>Baby me. I'm ready.
Hey, look.
The guys in the next building<br/>are waving at me.
Hello, gentlemen!
We're going to make a baby!
I can't believe we lost her.
See, this is exactly why<br/>I'm never having kids.
You can't let them out of your sight<br/>for even a second.
I can't find my file.
I pulled out "A" through "G."
Ag! Aaaaggg.
They just sit there with<br/>their stupid bottles.
They cry.
They spit up.
And that's why kids suck.
It is a good thing we broke up.
I forgot how totally psycho<br/>you are on the kids thing.
I'm psycho?
Any time you even hear<br/>the word "kids,"
you get two little lactation stains<br/>on your shirt.
Thank God you're not a mom.<br/>You are such an ice queen.
Any baby nursing from you<br/>would get brain freeze.
Look, don't paint me as some sort of a<br/>freak for wanting to remain independent.
There are plenty of normal people out<br/>there who don't want to have kids.
Brother, lay your hand on this<br/>box of condoms and repeat after me.
I, state the fake name<br/>you give to women.
I, Johnny Banana.
Vow to always choose<br/>wet T-shirts over wet diapers.
- Vow to always...<br/>- Yeah, you're in great company there.
I'm gonna look for Lily<br/>in the bathroom.
While I'm in there,<br/>I'll grab you a tampon.
Great, and when you're done<br/>shaking off at the urinal,
maybe you could ask<br/>the wizard to give you a heart.
You know what? Maybe I should find<br/>somewhere else to stay this weekend.
- No argument here.<br/>- Fine.
Great.
Welcome, to our fraternity<br/>of non-paternity.

I think that you...
What is it, Eriksen?
Nothing.
I just think that you look...
very nice today.
What are you looking at?
I am looking at the future...
of our two companies, and
it looks very...
naked.
Would you excuse me<br/>just for a brief second?
Did anyone else see the drunk chick?
Hey, you guys didn't have to...
It's a picture of me with no kids.
And there's macaroni glued<br/>on the frame.
Guys, I love it.
Well, Lily's not in there.
Your phone rang. I answered it.<br/>I hope you don't mind.
- Marshall's got Lily. She's fine.<br/>- Oh, thank God.
What?
When I was putting<br/>your phone back, and...
- I found something in your bag.<br/>- I have a permit for that.
- And the other thing was a gift.<br/>- No
This.
You stole Jeremy's sock.
No, I didn't.
I don't know how that got in there.<br/>It must've fallen in. Weird!
- "Fallen in"?<br/>- Or Lily put it in there as a joke.
That bitch be drunk.
Okay, I took it.
It's just...
so cute.

Robin Scherbatsky, are you warming<br/>to the idea of having children?
No.
I don't know.
Maybe someday.

Look, I'm just...
I'm confused lately. I'm unemployed.<br/>I'm living on a couch.
Yeah.
It's been a rough couple<br/>of months for both of us.
Hey, I have a spare bedroom.
Why don't you stay with me while you<br/>look for a place?
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
Thanks, Ted. I already have some leads,<br/>so it'll be one week, two weeks tops.
And that's how your Aunt Robin<br/>moved in with me.
I'm bored.<br/>Let's go dancing.
- Let's rob a liquor store!<br/>- Lily, we're not going anywhere, okay?
Whenever we go somewhere<br/>when you're drunk,
you always fall asleep as soon<br/>as we get in the...
We're going dancing!
We're gonna party<br/>all night long!
Can you circle the block<br/>a couple times

Sure thing.

Exactly. It's a tie.
But all of that<br/>is about to change.
Am I correct that<br/>you are an architect?
My best friend would really know that,<br/>but go on.
And what are you<br/>currently designing?

Not the New York Public Library.
It's the new public library in York,<br/>North Dakota.
Their books are in two sections:<br/>Fishin' and non-fishin'.
Then I think you are going to really<br/>like what happened at work today.
And so, while those bribes<br/>did destabilize the regime
and caused the death<br/>of most of the royal family,
it did lead to looser<br/>banking regulations in Rangoon.
So yay us.
Okay, last order of business.
It's been decided we're going<br/>to move forward with plans
for Goliath National Bank's<br/>new downtown headquarters.
- Who's gonna design it?<br/>- Was my first question.
Who's gonna design it?
We've already approached<br/>one firm about it.
This Swedish architecture collective<br/>called Sven.
Sven was this Swedish<br/>architecture collective
revered for their bold,<br/>innovative designs.
I hated those guys.
I hate those guys.
- Swedish architecture collective.<br/>- Lame.
- Pretentious.<br/>- "We're not a company.
- We're a collective."<br/>- I know.
"We are Swedish.
"We are so cool with our baguettes<br/>and our Eiffel Tower."
Dude, Sweden's not France.<br/>You know that, right?
Oh, it's France.
So anyway, I say to Bilson...
Bilson, with all due respect...
No, I stand up,<br/>and I say to Bilson...
Bilson, with all due respect...
Music.
Imagine patriotic music playing.
With all due respect,
it would be terrible
if a job that could go to<br/>a hard-working American
architecture firm,
went to a bunch of French guys.
Where is our patriotism?
Our sense of country?
- Our love of all that is...<br/>- Look, Stinson,
no one hates every other country<br/>in the world as much as I do,
but you better have a point.
I do.
I know a fantastic American architect<br/>who would be perfect for the job.
So, all you gotta do is come in,<br/>pitch your design,
I get the board to approve it,<br/>and the job is yours.
Do you realize what a hero I would be<br/>if I brought this project to my firm?
And that's not even the best part.
All three of us<br/>are gonna be working together.
Ted can be on the conference call.
He can totally be<br/>on the conference call.
- What's the conference call?<br/>- The way it works is,
one of us will duck into<br/>the other's office and say...
Marshall, the conference<br/>call's about to start.
I'm sorry, guys, I gotta go.
And then we go up<br/>to the roof of the building...
and drink beer.
This is awesome.<br/>Drinking at work.
We're basically Mad Men.
We are!<br/>We're such Mad Men!
I'm gonna go smack<br/>a secretary on the ass.
That's totally what they would do<br/>on that show.
What show?
And then, we throw crumpled up<br/>beer cans at pigeons.
- I don't do that.<br/>- I totally want to do that.
- Well, I am gonna make that happen.<br/>- Seriously, Barney,
after everything I went through<br/>with Stella,
getting me this opportunity...
It really means a lot.
It really did.
You see, kids, when I became<br/>an architect, I had one dream...
to contribute a building<br/>to the skyline of New York City.
I wanted to be able to point to one<br/>of those buildings and say,
see that one?<br/>That one right there?
That's mine.
This job was my opportunity<br/>to do just that.
Your friend's having her birthday here?
What's she turning, 19?
Believe me, this isn't her scene.
She probably just didn't know<br/>what kind of place this was.
Over here, you sexy bitch!<br/>We've got bottle service!
Oh, my God.
At school, she's so quiet and normal.<br/>I had no idea she's...
she's a Woo Girl.
What's a Woo Girl?<br/>Let me explain.
A Woo Girl is a type of young woman,
who, like the cuckoo bird<br/>or the whip-poor-will,
gets her name from the signature sound<br/>she makes.
Now, a woo can be elicited<br/>in many different ways.
From a certain song<br/>coming on the jukebox...
Oh, my God,<br/>this song is totally about me.
... to half-priced shots.
... from a ride on a mechanical bull...
... to, well, pretty much anything.
Oh, my God, I was worried<br/>that I didn't feed the cat,
but then I rembered that I did.
I swear, at school<br/>Jillian seems so un-woo-y.
Yeah, she doesn't look wooish.
Maybe she only observes<br/>the high holidays,
like Mardi Gras and Spring Break.
Maybe she's just a cultural Woo.
Now... go easy on me.<br/>It's a work in progress.
Ted, this is amazing.
The detail.<br/>The shading. The...
playfulness of the lines.
This is exactly what Princess Leia<br/>would look like topless.
My way of saying thanks.
So... you want to see my designs<br/>for the building?
Nah, I'm good.
So get this.
Lily just texted me.<br/>She's at that bar Giddyups
with a bunch of Woo Girls.
Oh, my God, you guys,
my boob just fell out<br/>of my top at the bar.
Trick! I pulled it out for a free drink!
So, Jillian, I hear when you're
not flashing bartenders,<br/>you teach the second grade.
What's that like?
So rewarding.
I don't know if you're familiar<br/>with the RYE technique,
but it derives from the progressive<br/>educational philosophy
of Rudolf Steiner, who founded<br/>the Waldorf School, which...
Oh, my God.<br/>I love this song!
Come on, you lazy skanks,<br/>let's dance!
- You, too, you dumb whores.<br/>- No, thank you...
ignorant hussy.
Why, Lily Aldrin, you sly minx.
I've been saying for years<br/>that our gang need a Woo Girl,
and here you've been hiding<br/>a whole batch of them from me.
We do not need a Woo Girl.<br/>No one needs a Woo Girl.
Be careful, Lily.
The world absolutely needs Woo Girls.
If there were no Woo Girls,<br/>there'd be no Girls Gone Wild,
no bachelorette parties,
no Las Vegas poolside bars...
All the things that you hold<br/>dearest, Lily, would be gone.
- Those are none of the things...<br/>- The souvenir shot glass industry
would collapse.
So would the body glitter industry and
the stretch Hummer rental industry.
Tiny cowboy hats<br/>would be worn only
by tiny cowboys.
And when"Brown Eyed Girl"<br/>would come up on the jukebox,
all you would hear...
would be silence.
And "Brown Eyed Girl."
But who would woo, Lily?
Who would woo?
Would you?
Would you...
woo?
Who wants to name my boobs?!
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have a date with Hannity and Colmes.
Over the next couple of weeks,<br/>I do have into work.
It felt great to be working on something<br/>that I really cared about.
Finally, the morning<br/>of the presentation arrived.
And we believe this timeless design<br/>will radiate the strength
and stability
that is Goliath National Bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I left there feeling pretty good<br/>about my chances.
Later that night, we ran into Barney.
Give me the good news.
You didn't get it.
What?
The board
decided to go with Sven.
I can't believe I didn't get it.
I really thought I nailed the pitch.
Why would they go with Sven?
I did everything I could<br/>to change their minds.
But they wouldn't budge.
I'm sorry.
This really sucks.
After the way these last<br/>couple of months have gone...
I guess I need this more<br/>than I thought I did.
You want to go down to the current<br/>GNB building and just, like...
I don't know,
just pee on it a little bit?
Yeah, I think I need that.
Finish your beer.<br/>File the tank.
What happen's?
Ted didn't get that job.
But that's not the biggest<br/>disappointment of the day.
- What?<br/>- We saw you woo.
- Saw who woo?<br/>- Saw you woo.
- I didn't woo.<br/>- You did, too.
- That's not true.<br/>- Your nose just grew.
You're, like, best friends<br/>with Jillian now?
It's just...
You're married, Lily,<br/>but I'm still single.
Whenever I hang out with you,
I'm usually the third wheel<br/>to you and Marshall.
Sometimes, it's fun to go out<br/>with other single women
and do stuff that you don't want to.
Like what?
Like woo, Lily.
Like woo.
- I can woo.<br/>- That's not true.
- I can, too.<br/>- It's just not you.
I just want to say, I know<br/>you guys went with Sven, but...
Ted Mosby is tremendously talented, and
I think he would have done<br/>a hell of a job.
I agree.<br/>That's why I voted for him.
So, then, it's agreed.<br/>From now on,
all ATM fees are now called<br/>Freedom Charges.
Conference call. Now.
You got something you want to tell me?
Damn it.
I told Heather to put everything back<br/>on your desk the way it was.
Bilson told me he wanted<br/>to give the job to Ted.
So what happened?
Okay, fine.
...will radiate the strength
and stability
that is Goliath National Bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.
So?
That was great. I love it.
Looks like we got our guy.
I don't think we even need<br/>to meet with...
I am Sven Jorgensen.
With me are Sven Pilsen and<br/>Sven Johanssen, and we are...
You are Goliath National Bank.
You are cutting edge.<br/>You are new. You are fresh.
Women want to be with you,<br/>men wish to harm you,
but the fool who dares challenge you<br/>shall be crushed!
Your headquarters will tell<br/>the world of these facts.
Oh, and one more thing...<br/>don't look now!
Which of you is Barney Stinson,<br/>head of the search committee?
Oh, my God. That's me!
You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power<br/>and virility.
Your office shall be here,<br/>in the head of a tyrannosaurus rex.
I never knew it till now,<br/>but I've always dreamed of that.
On your large desk of Honduran rosewood<br/>shall be this button.
- What does the button do?<br/>- Press it! Press it for glory!
This is the most awesome building<br/>in the universe.
There is no way this building<br/>could be more awesome.
There is a strip club<br/>in the letter "N."
What the hell is the matter<br/>with you?! This is
Ted's big break!<br/>And then you sold him out
because you wanted to work<br/>in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus rex,
which, incidentally, if you knew<br/>anything about dinosaurs, is really,
really small.
Marshall, this isn't<br/>about my office.
Ted's building was good.<br/>Sven's was better.
And I am not going to let the fact<br/>that I am Ted's best friend
be a factor in business.
You didn't pick Sven's building<br/>because it was better.
You picked it because you wanted<br/>to work in a cool dinosaur office.
That's a lie!
I picked it because it...
It breathes fire, Marshall.
"Fire Marshall."
- I didn't even notice.<br/>- How could you do this to Ted
after everything he's been through<br/>with Stella?!
You're just being selfish.
Marshall, I would never
make a business decision<br/>for selfish reasons.
I am a professional.
Now, come on.
Let's get a nice daytime drunk going,<br/>and throw empties at pigeons.
No. For two reasons.<br/>One,
pigeons are smarter than you think.
They hold grudges.<br/>And, two...
this is our last conference call,<br/>Mr. Stinson.
There are repercussions<br/>to screwing over a friend.
- Like what?<br/>- Like this.
Oh, my God, you guys.
Last night, we raised<br/>$10,000 for my charity
to help combat childhood illiteracy.
It's a really serious issue.
Someone just earned herself<br/>an ass-first ride
down the dance floor spank canyon!
Lily, what are you doing here?
Just doing the fun things<br/>you single girls do.
What's with the plastic fireman's hat?
I didn't have a cowboy hat,
and today was fire safety day<br/>at school, so...
Oh, my God, bitch.<br/>This is our anthem.
Really? Who sings this?
Is LL Cool J still doing things?
This is great, Svens.
You guys are so much cooler<br/>than Marshall.
He doesn't even own a unitard.
Who wants a brew?
I don't understand.<br/>Where is the conference call?
This is the conference call.<br/>Get it?
In America, when we work late,
we lie about a conference call,
and we come up here and we drink<br/>a few beers. It's awesome.
This is a waste of time.<br/>Push-ups!
Misty, you are such a slut.
Let's do another shot.
You're the slut, you skank.<br/>Shots are on you.
No, bitch, shots are on you.<br/>You're such a whore.
You're all a bunch of prostitutes.<br/>You probably have STDs.
Let's go dance.
This isn't working.<br/>You shouldn't be here.
I get it. Because I'm happily married,<br/>I'm some kind of loser?
Exactly the opposite.
Why do you think the Woo Girls<br/>have to woo
when they win a game of beer pong,
or when a hot guy takes his shirt off?
It's because that is as good<br/>as life gets for them.
They're really sad people.
And, when they hang out with someone<br/>who's got it all figured out...
someone like you...
it bums them out.
It takes away their woo.
You're just saying that so I don't feel<br/>like an old married lady.
Look at those girls, Lily.
Look at them and listen to what<br/>their woo's are really saying.
"I cry in the shower!"
"I've never been<br/>on a seconde date!"
"What if I nerver<br/>get to be a Mom?!"
"I'm secretly in<br/>love with Jillian!"
"My career and love life<br/>are heading nowhere!"
Those poor girls... and Ted.
I just want to go<br/>give them all a hug.
Lily, right now I'm like them.
I'm unemployed, I'm single,<br/>I'm a little lost.
So
every once in a while,<br/>I need to woo,
but when I need to talk<br/>about something real,
you're the one I turn to.
- You're my best friend.<br/>- And you're mine.
And I promise I'll make more time<br/>for just us.
Marshall doesn't have to tag along<br/>to everything we do.
Hey, have you guys tried<br/>these purple hooter test tube shots?
I've had five of 'em.
I don't even think<br/>there's alcohol in here.
- Where'd you get that hat?<br/>- What hat?
- We fired Sven.<br/>- What?
Yeah, those guys were idiots.
I mean, sure,<br/>they had some cool ideas...
some really cool ideas. Actually,<br/>I wonder if it's not too late to...
The point is, you got the job.
Really?
The search committee realized<br/>they made the wrong decision.
Plus, you really mean a lot to them<br/>and they want you to be happy.
That's weird.
Look, Ted, your design was the best,
and you deserve it.
There's also something<br/>that you should know
about why you didn't get<br/>the job in the first place.
- You see, Ted...<br/>- It was Bilson.
Bilson just wanted to have an office<br/>in a dinosaur head,
but Barney convinced him
- that it was really, really stupid.<br/>- Well, you know.
Thank you, Barney.
I can't believe this.
I just got our firm the biggest<br/>account we've ever had.
"Now only my<br/>love life's a disaster!"
Next round's on me.
Why'd you let me off the hook?
You did the right thing.<br/>Seemed like you deserved a bye.
Plus, it would have really bummed<br/>Ted out, and he's finally...
happy right now.
You really are Ted's best friend.
And so am I.<br/>It's a tie.
Thanks, Marshall.
Marshall wound up caving<br/>and telling me the truth about Barney,
like, ten minutes later,
at which point we tied Uncle Barney<br/>to the mechanical bull,
cranked it up to a setting called<br/>"Paint Mixer"
and went home.
- I love you, man.<br/>- Love you, too, buddy.
Hey, you going to<br/>ride the bull tonight?
Not if you paid me.<br/>I have an inner ear thing.
It was a pretty great night.
Three hours.<br/>That's a bull record.
That's right, ladies.
Jillian, you know what would be<br/>really crazy, and funny,
and stupid to do tonight?
If you and me find a guy<br/>and have a three-way.
Maybe.<br/>If we found the right guy.
Yeah, and, if we don't<br/>find the right guy
- Maybe you and I could just...<br/>- You know who's really cute?
That guy Ted.<br/>Let's go find him.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, everyone has an opinion<br/>on how long it takes
to recover from a breakup.
Half the length<br/>of the relationship.
One week for every month<br/>you were together.
Exactly 10,000 drinks.<br/>However long that takes.
You can't measure something<br/>like this in time.
There's a series of steps.
From her bed to the front door.<br/>Bam! Out of there. Next!
But I think you start to recover<br/>the moment you meet
that person who gets<br/>you back in the game.
This is the story<br/>of how I met that person.
Now, kids, if you want to go swimming,<br/>you don't just dive in.
First, you dip<br/>your toe in the water.
You check the temperature.<br/>See how it feels.
I'm Ted.
Vicky.
And then you slowly wade in.
I got left at the altar<br/>a month ago.
Or, you know, cannonball.
It was a complete disaster<br/>and ever since then,
I haven't been able to even<br/>look at another woman.
Except for the old lady on the subway<br/>who break-dances for nickels.
I don't look at her that way.<br/>I just look at her.
I mean, it's an old lady<br/>break-dancing.
And she is good.
I'm going to give her<br/>a dollar next time.
Hey, let's pretend<br/>I just said this:
These elevator rides have been<br/>the highlight of my week,
and I'd love to see you again<br/>friday night.
Not in the elevator.
At a restaurant, a nice one.
What do you say?
Yes.
Sync by vNaru
Kids, I walked in<br/>on a lot of crazy stuff
at the old apartment over the years.
Sorry, guys. I'm just going to go<br/>with a bowl of fruit.
It's been 12 minutes!
- Drop it!<br/>- You first!
Ike, why are you pointing<br/>your gun at me?
- Don't use my name!<br/>- Put the guns down, now!
But one of the craziest things<br/>I ever walked in on
happened when I was roommates<br/>with your Aunt Robin.
Who are you?!
Mitch.
What you doing, Mitch?
You must be the roommate.
I'm on a date with Robin.
She had to step outside<br/>to take a call.
I guess her cell phone<br/>doesn't work in here.
Robin... didn't use<br/>the super secret signal.
We put this old takeout menu<br/>on the doorknob.
Place went out of business.
Mr. Wang's...
Guess I don't have to explain<br/>why that's funny.
I'm going to go.
When you leave,
take the seat cushion with you.<br/>That's trash now.
I think that I am more than qualified<br/>for the job.
My weaknesses?
I would say caring too much,
working too hard, and putting my career<br/>in front of my love life.
Whoops, that last one was real.<br/>What?!
Well, it appears our sweet, innocent,<br/>little Robin has taken a lover.
A young blade<br/>by the name of Mitch.
Her blind date?
Total bust. She's been sending me<br/>text messages all night.
She just let him go upstairs<br/>to use the bathroom a second ago.
Excuse me a minute.
Buddy, you are killing me. I'm kind of<br/>in the middle of something here.
Middle of what?!
This is my move.
It's called, "The Naked Man."
"The Naked Man"?
Goes like this:
You're on a first date,
you've had a few drinks,
you make an excuse to go up<br/>to the girl's apartment.
So, the bathroom's right there.
You know what,<br/>I'm going to grab this.
Then, once she leaves the room,
you strip down naked and wait.
When she comes back,<br/>she laughs.
She's so charmed by<br/>your confidence and bravado,
she sleeps with you.
There is no way that works!
Two out of three times.
- Two out of three times?<br/>- Two out of three times.
You just have to pick your spot.
The Naked Man is best used<br/>as a last resort,
kind of a Hail Mary on a
first date when you know<br/>there's not going to be a second one.
How do you know there's not going<br/>to be a second date?
- Ted, look at me.<br/>- I'd rather not, Mitch.
Robin is way out of my league.
I'm not smart,<br/>funny or handsome.
And as you can plainly see,<br/>there's nothing impressive
going on anywhere around here.
My only shot with a girl like Robin<br/>is the element of surprise.
And, let's be honest,<br/>a little pity.
It's shock and "aw."
This doesn't really work.
Two out of three times.
Guaranteed.
No way.
Two out of three times.<br/>He guaranteed it.
Come on.
There is no way that's going<br/>to work on Robin.
She's going to walk in there,<br/>take one look at that idiot
and send him packing.
She might kick his ass first.
She might get her gun<br/>and shoot him.
Go, go!
My God!
It worked.
Mr. Wang's is back in business?!
The Naked Man works!
This is going to revolutionize<br/>the one-night stand!
This is like the forward pass<br/>in football.
The slam dunk in basketball.
The haircutting technique<br/>where they hold it
between their fingers<br/>and cut right above it.
It's a total game changer!
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,
who you claim to be in love with.<br/>How can you be excited about this?
The Naked Man<br/>is bigger than me and Robin.
All these years,
I have been busting my hump,
with my secret identities<br/>and my tricks and my gadgets.
I mean,
I'm like Batman.
But this Mitch fellow, he's Superman.
He just rips off his clothes<br/>and he's good to go.
What kind of gadgets<br/>are we talking about?
So, this is what it's going to be like,<br/>us living together? I come home,
and guys you're dating are just going<br/>to be sitting on the couch, naked.
Well, I wish I could say no.
I still cannot believe the Naked Man<br/>worked on you.
What can I say? Okay,<br/>I went in there, and he was naked.
It was funny.<br/>I laughed, he laughed.
And then it just kind of happened.<br/>I don't know.
I call "slut!"
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Robin, but you<br/>hooking up with this guy
makes it seem like<br/>the only thing standing
between you and sex is clothes.
I didn't just sleep with Mitch<br/>because he was naked.
Then why did you sleep with him?
Because...
he...
He...
Because I care about Mitch.
A lot.
There was a... connection
of specialness.
Of...
specialness and feelings.
It was because he was naked.
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.
There is only one reason
to sleep with somebody,<br/>and that is love.
Marshall's a big girl<br/>because he believes in true love
and just finished reading The Notebook
because the secretaries bullied him<br/>into joing Oprah's Book Club.
Fine! But you know I'm right.
Marshall, I love you, but there's lots<br/>of reasons to have sex.
- Name one.<br/>- I can name 50.
- You can't.<br/>- Number one:
Last Thursday.
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?<br/>- I'm up.
You befouled our marital bed<br/>because you couldn't get to sleep?!
You're the one who said,
"That shadow on the ceiling<br/>looks like a scary toothless clown.
Good night, Lily."
Fine! That's one.
- But I defy you to name...<br/>- I'm going to name 50.
There's "makeup" sex...
"breakup" sex...
and "your friend just told you<br/>about a new-position" sex.
You're welcome.
There's also "revenge",
"rebound",
"paratrooping."
You know, when you go out of town
but instead of getting a hotel room,<br/>you go straight to a bar
with the sole intention<br/>of hooking up
with a girl so you have<br/>a place to stay.
Oh, you mean<br/>"banging for roof."
Slut!
I don't do it.<br/>My college roommate did it.
No, Robin,<br/>I just have a bad cough.
I don't really have<br/>a bad cough.
We all know "college roommate"<br/>means you, slut!
Does anyone have a lozenge?
I've got one.<br/>"Nothing good on television" sex.
"Hotel room" sex.
"Curiosity,"
as in...
"I've always wondered what it's like<br/>to have sex with a really tall girl."
Not a big girl,
just a tall girl.
Like...
if a normal girl
were seven,
seven-and-a-half-feet tall and
wore a denim miniskirt.
I would have to know<br/>what that is like.
32 reasons later...
"He said he loved you,
but you're not ready to<br/>say it back yet" sex.
Forty-three.
"Wingman diving on<br/>the friend grenade."
Forty-four.
"The condoms are<br/>about to expire."
Forty-five.
This is getting a little hard.
Forty-six!
Okay, four more to go.<br/>Ooh!
"You dropped a Cheeto on his lap
"and when you reached for it,<br/>he thought you were making a move,
"so you just went with it."
Thank you for ruing the memory<br/>of our six-month anniversary.
You got me Cheetos.
Can we just stop<br/>with this stupid list?
You guys are making me sad.
No, I'm having fun.
Man, this whole "one-partner"<br/>thing sucks sometimes.
I'm always talking about you.
I can't play "I never" because
then everyone would know all the<br/>weird stuff I let you do to me.
The only weird thing I ever did to you<br/>was open up my heart and soul
when all I had to do was strip naked<br/>while you were out of the room.
I didn't sleep with Mitch<br/>because he was naked!
Mitch and I<br/>have something special.
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.<br/>He may be the one.
The one?!<br/>Mitch?! The Naked Man?!
You mean the naked genius.
All these years I've been suiting up<br/>when I should have been suiting down.
That's it. I am doing The Naked Man<br/>tonight. Ted, so are you.
- What?<br/>- With the elevator girl.
You're going out with her<br/>tonight, right? Naked Man!
No. Barney, come on,<br/>this is the first girl
I've had the courage<br/>to ask out since Stella.
Naked Man!
No, Barney, this is the eighth<br/>outfit I tried on tonight!
I got my hair cut three times!<br/>I'm a nervous wreck!
Are you wearing makeup?
It's not makeup!
Iit's a sunscreen<br/>with a subtle tint of...
It's made for men.
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.
Naked Man!
No, Barney, I like Vicky.
This could actually<br/>go somewhere.
I don't want to do anything<br/>stupid to jeopardize it.
Well, I really like...
that girl,
but... Oh, I didn't see her<br/>from the back.
I really like...
that girl.
And I'm willing to jeopardize<br/>our future together
for one night of glory.
Naked Man!
So, that night, we all set out<br/>to prove something.
Robin wanted to<br/>defend her honor.
Mitch, hey baby, it's me.
Robin.
Do you want to grab<br/>some dinner tonight?
Because you're<br/>basically my boyfriend!
Lily needed to prove that<br/>she could finish her list.
I'm stuck. I can't think<br/>of the last two.
Reason number 48:
To reinforce good behaviors<br/>such as shaving and dental hygiene.
Oh, now you're<br/>conditioning me? Great!
That explains why I always get<br/>an erection when I floss.
I had to prove that as scary<br/>as it was to be dating again,
I was over Stella and ready<br/>to get back out there.
And Barney needed to prove that he,<br/>too, could pull off The Naked Man.
Hey, thank you for letting me<br/>look at your aquarium.
- You're a real life saver.<br/>- Sure, no problem.
I just need to use the bathroom<br/>and I'll be on my way.
Ted, I'm doing it.
I'm doing the Naked Man!
Me, too!
You...
I'm doing it!<br/>I'm doing The Naked Man!
That's great!
What made you change your mind?
The date with Vicky<br/>started off okay, but,
it didn't go as well as I hoped.
Oh, my God!<br/>Ted, you are so funny!
And can I just say,<br/>you have amazing eyes.
What, these old things?
Oh! Nice job, hot shot.
- I'm sorry...<br/>- Save it!
Go tell the manager<br/>he owes us an appetizer.
One of the ones with shrimp!
You're welcome.<br/>You were saying?
And then his cane<br/>missed the top step,
and he was falling, for,<br/>I swear, like two minutes.
God, I love old people.
Once I realized there was no<br/>possible future in this relationship,
I just decided to go for it.
Awesome!<br/>Okay, big question:
What pose will you display<br/>your Naked Man in?
That is a big question.<br/>I hadn't really thought about it.
I was thinking the Superman.
What about the Captain Morgan?
How about the<br/>"Oops, I didn't see you there"?
The Thinker?
What about the Heisman?
Mr. Clean?
The Burt Reynolds.
It's so great to see you again.
I really had a<br/>great time last night.
So, what is it like<br/>managing a C.P.K.?
I mean, who's idea was it<br/>to put a pineapple in the...
Okay, stop right there.<br/>I know what this is.
I've been on this date before.<br/>This is the "I'm not a slut" date.
What?<br/>That's crazy.
Usually you read me so well,<br/>but this time you're wrong.
Come on, Robin. One of us<br/>had a good time last night,
and we both know it was me.
Oh, Mitchell...<br/>Something,
that is, that is just not true!
Really?<br/>How was the sex?
I didn't hate it.
Robin, you've seen my move.
That's it.
I have nothing else<br/>to offer you.
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,
and I'm in, like, five different<br/>fantasy football leagues.
It's all I talk about.
Trust me, you don't want<br/>to be around that.
What? Yes, I do!
Look, I didn't just sleep with you<br/>because you were naked.
Yeah, you did.
And now you're trying to<br/>pretend it was something more
to make yourself feel better.
Say what you will,
at least The Naked Man<br/>is honest.
What about the old<br/>"Coppertone Baby"?
The Olympic gymnast<br/>who stuck the landing.
Hup!
I got to go.
Naked Man!
You have a really nice place!
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,<br/>that's a real compliment.
I just love that you're an architect,<br/>it's so fascinating.
I could listen to you talk about<br/>structural design all night.
And then I noticed,<br/>lying on her end table,
a book of love poems<br/>by Pablo Neruda.
The same edition<br/>I'd had since college.
And it was bookmarked<br/>to my favorite poem.
Maybe I was all wrong<br/>about this girl.
Maybe there was<br/>a future for us.
Crap!
Here we go.
Pablo Neruda.
Oh, yeah,
that book's a turd.
Some douchey guy I hooked up with<br/>left it here. It's all in Mexican.
You know who writes good poems?
Jewel.
Her teeth are crooked<br/>and she lived in a car.
- So, she has stuff to write about.<br/>- Ta-dah!
Okay.
The Naked Man works!
I just had decent sex with<br/>an awful human being.
- I am back!<br/>- Congratulations, buddy.
You're not the only one who<br/>rocked The Naked Man tonight.
You just want to do it<br/>to change the subject.
Yeah.
Hey, that's number 49!
Did it work?
It's like I just flossed.
I love you.
That's 50.
Oh, yeah...
Nice! What pose<br/>did you go with?
I went with<br/>"I've got boobs."
And she nailed it.
Oh, my God!<br/>Guys, guys, guys!
This is him!
This is The Naked Man!
Ted, his name is Mitch.
And,
he's my boyfriend. So...
It's okay, Robin.<br/>I no longer call "slut."
- Okay. You can go. We're done.<br/>- Thanks.
Hold on, Mitch, Mitch,<br/>I have to thank you.
We all tried<br/>The Naked Man tonight.
We should see how Barney did.
- Hello?<br/>- Hi, is Barney there?
No.
Oh, my God!<br/>What's the matter with you?!
Get out!
I just have to grab my suit.<br/>It's very expensive. The tie alone...
Get out of here right now!<br/>Get out!
- You sick son of a bitch!<br/>- Call me.
And if I see him again,<br/>I'm calling the cops.
Two out of three times.
Mitch, I want you to know,<br/>this night,
crazy as it was,
it got me out of my shell.
That's the beauty of<br/>The Naked Man.
It gives you exactly what you need.<br/>No more,
no less.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to replace one of<br/>my fantasy football quarterbacks.
He separated his shoulder!
A toast...
to Mitch.
By the sum of his parts,<br/>he is just a man.
But by what he does with those parts,<br/>he becomes so much more.
He may not fit society's<br/>definition of a hero,
but he is the hero I needed.
The hero who helped me<br/>recover from the disaster
of my failed almost-marriage<br/>and get back into the game.
He lives in the shadows.
Is he a dream?
Truth?<br/>Fiction?
Damnation?<br/>Salvation?
He is all these things and<br/>none of them. For he is...
"The Naked Man."
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God.

[<div class="full-script">Why do we fight?
What does that thing<br/>deep within each of us,
that compels us to settle<br/>disagreements with our fists?
Whatever it is,<br/>it's there right from the beginning.
- Stop fighting!<br/>- Why?
Because it's stupid<br/>and juvenile.
We're six.<br/>We are stupid and juvenile.
Kids, I've only been<br/>in one fight in my life.
And this is the story<br/>of how it happened.
Now, as you know,<br/>I recently had been left at the altar.
And the worst thing<br/>about getting left at the altar?
I mean, aside from<br/>actually getting left at the altar,
was what came next.
A steady unrelenting<br/>unbearable stream of pity.
Cranberry Gin and tonic.
Scotch and soda.
Thank you.
Could I see a menu?
I'm going to go get you a menu...
but I promise you
I will come back.
We have to start<br/>going someplace else.
At this bar,<br/>I'm always going to be
the guy who got left at<br/>the altar. That sucks!
Good times.
- We lost Barney.<br/>- What do you mean?
There's a girl over there<br/>in a tight red sweater.
So he's not listening<br/>to a word anyone's saying.
Right, Barney?
Give me a break!
See, he figured out a while back
he could fake an entire conversation
just by saying titles of black sitcoms<br/>from the 70's and 80's.
What's happening?
Want to go upstairs and do stuff to me
that I won't even let Marshall do?
Different strokes.
What the hell is this?!
I've told you kids about Doug, right?
I haven't?<br/>Oh, well...
Doug Martin was a bartender<br/>at MacLaren's.
He was always kind of around.
- Have... you met Ted?<br/>- What?
We're not playing<br/>"Have you met Ted?".
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
Tonight...
I pick up a lesbian.
Anyway, three things<br/>you need to know about Doug.
The first thing is that Doug<br/>had a bit of a violent streak.
...crumbled, so he's<br/>on the ground, right?
And we're just kicking him!<br/>He's making that face, all shaking.
So, anyway, what we did<br/>was we left him there.
Top you off?
The second thing is that<br/>he was weird about his hair.
What?
What?
Are you looking at my hair?
No, sir. I was not.
It's a toupee.
Is that funny?<br/>You want to laugh it up?
Is it funny, guy?<br/>Is it?
I'll tell you what,<br/>why don't you grab it?
- Excuse me?<br/>- Go ahead, grab it.
Grab it right off my head.<br/>Go ahead.
You don't want to grab it?<br/>Come on.
Come on, go ahead and grab it.
Want to grab it off my head?<br/>Grab my toupee right off my head.
I like you guys!
But the third thing is that<br/>he was very loyal to his regulars.
There they are!<br/>Hey, you guys want your booth?
We're fine over here.
Maybe a little too loyal.
No, it's fine.
Okay, you two lovebirds!<br/>Let's take this somewhere else...
booth's reserved.
Let's go! Now! Come on!
Let's see some hustle, Father.<br/>Up you get.
Okay, guys, here we are!
So, that's Doug.
What the hell is this?!
Some guys are<br/>sitting in our booth.
But you know what?<br/>This is fine.
Let's go, I'll take care of it.
Oh boy, there he goes.
Ladies, if you'll please adjourn<br/>to your usual booth.
Gentlemen, I will require<br/>your assistance outside.
Our assistance with what?
We're going to go out in the alley<br/>and fight those guys.
What's happening now?
Sync by vNaru
I'm sorry, did you just say<br/>we were gonna...
Those guys are being<br/>inconsiderate, okay?
So we're going to go outside
and cave in their skulls, okay?<br/>This will be fun!
He wants us to fight?<br/>Like...
Like, with our hands and stuff?
And feet maybe?<br/>I don't know what the rules are.
A fight. Should we go out there?
Come on, Ted.
There's only three things<br/>you'll ever see me fight:
The stubborn clasp of a bra,
sexual harassment charges...<br/>nine for nine...
And the urge to vomit when I see<br/>someone wearing brown shoes
with a black suit.
Dude, fighting is for losers.<br/>We're civilized guys.
Civilized guys don't fight.<br/>Unless it's with lightsabers.
But that's like three<br/>to five years away, so...
Well, that's not true.
Robin, I'm on the forums every day.
Three to five Thanksgivings from now,
I'm going to be carving<br/>the turkey with Old Green.
No, I'm saying there are plenty<br/>of legitimate reasons
to get in a fight...<br/>it might not be pretty,
but in certain situations,<br/>you gotta do what you gotta do.
Right, I forgot.<br/>She thinks fighting's sexy.
No, I do not! A lot...
Look, I come from a culture<br/>of hockey players.
If a guy can throw down,<br/>it's somewhat way hot.
And scars, hello!
If a guy's got a scar,<br/>he's got a Robin.
And if he's missing teeth?<br/>I'm missing my pants.
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.
Outpatient procedure.
Local anesthesia.<br/>Whatever. It ain't a thing.
Maybe we should go out there.
I can't believe we're even having<br/>this discussion.
You're 30,<br/>you're too old to act like this.
I was 30 and in those 30 years<br/>I'd been punched once.
There's a very simple explana...
There was that thing at camp.
Today, we're going to braid<br/>friendship bracelets.
In college, I studied some Kung Fu.
And well, there was<br/>some other stuff.
The thing with the goat wasn't<br/>for another few months.
The point is,<br/>I had never been in a fight.
I'm going out there.
Dude, listen to me,
please, trust me, I've been<br/>in plenty of fights. It's...
really nothing to be proud of.
Who did you get in a fight with?
My brothers.
I'm sure that was quite a rumble<br/>in the Eriksen rumpus room.
- I love brotherly horseplay!<br/>- Here comes the tickle monster!
Noogie patrol!
Wait, wait, wait! Timesies! Timesies!
Cocoa break.
Cocoa break.
It's clobbering time.
Ted, don't do this.
You're a nice guy.<br/>That's your best quality.
Is it?
'Cause I seem to rember this nice guy<br/>getting dumped by his fianc?e
for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.
Look, this may<br/>sound crazy, but I...
I think I need to do this.
I think this is an experience<br/>I need to have.
I'm going.
Me, too!
Guys...
take a good look at this face,
because the next time you see it,
it will be disfigured<br/>in the hottest possible way.
Because that's who I am...<br/>I'm a man.
I like to fight and mix it up<br/>and get all dirty.
Can you find<br/>a wood hanger for this?
- What happened here?<br/>- I know, right?!
Who's not looking at my toupee now?!
Look what we did to these guys!
- "We?"<br/>- Yeah, "we."
Come on, man,<br/>we're a good team.
Nice work boys! We did it!
No you did it.<br/>We didn't do anything.
Sure, I just beat up<br/>three guys by myself.
You guys. That's good.<br/>You and you...
free drinks for life.
He thinks we were in this fight<br/>with him.
We were in this fight with him.
And now we are going to go in there<br/>and tell everyone
the legendary tale<br/>of how we beat up some guys.
And everyone is going to think<br/>it's great
and everyone is going to sleep with me<br/>again.
Dude, come on, no one is gonna<br/>believe we were in a fight...
- look at us.<br/>- That's a good...
What are you doing?!
What I should've done a long time ago.
- What?<br/>- I don't know,
I just hit myself in the eye!<br/>I don't even know what I'm saying...
I throw an awesome right hook,<br/>by the way.
Okay, are you ready?
- To go back in?<br/>- No, for this.
God! You just punched me in the nose!
- Are you crying?<br/>- Yes, I'm crying!
You just punched me in the nose!
That's going to swell up real good.<br/>You're going to look like Owen Wilson.
Let's get back in there.
Okay, but just, let's just play<br/>this down, okay?
I don't want this to turn<br/>into a big thing.
And Ted comes<br/>and takes his shoe off!
Hits him in the mouth...
Hey, there they are!<br/>The guys that got my back!
You two got in a fight.<br/>Really?
Barney punched me<br/>and himself in the face
to make it look like we got in a fight.
Come on, Marshall!
Look at your eye.
You look like a badass.
I'm surprised to see you had it in me.<br/>You.
Had it in you.
Do you...
want to touch it?
Oh, my God, it's warm!
Hey! Victory drinks!
Free! Free!<br/>Free! Free!
$7.50.
Why do I have to pay?
'Cause you don't got my back.
- These guys got my back.<br/>- You know what, Doug?
I will gladly pay.<br/>And you know why?
Because that's what grownups do.
They pay for their drinks,<br/>and they don't get into fights.
You know what I was doing, while you<br/>guys were out there being immature?
- I'll tell you what I was doing.<br/>- Your nails?
- I was doing...<br/>- The relationship quiz
in this month's Cosmo?
- I was doing...<br/>- Your best not to cry
when Big came back for Carrie at<br/>the end of the Sex and the Citymovie?
Spoilers much?
- I'll tell you what I was doing...<br/>- The captain of the football team
because he gave you his promise ring
and you look so pretty<br/>in your open back Homecoming dress?
Sorry.
I hate those guys!
Acting like they're the manliest<br/>guys in the universe,
like they're Crocodile<br/>Dundee and David Hasselhoff.
Those are the manliest guys<br/>in the universe?
I don't understand why they're getting<br/>all this attention. I mean,
I'm the real hero here.
- Yeah, you are.<br/>- I'm serious, woman.
Put it back in your pants.
You're the man every boy<br/>should grow up to become
and every girl should marry.
You know what?
I have two kids in my class<br/>who won't stop fighting.
If you come to school tomorrow and
tell them your story of choosing<br/>the path of nonviolence,
it might really set them straight.
And save me having to get up early<br/>to make a lesson plan.
All right.
I'll set them straight.
- You're a wuss.<br/>- What?
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala<br/>are telling you kids this story
- to illustrate...<br/>- To illustrate that you're a wuss?
Why didn't you just fight those guys?
- Were you scared?<br/>- What?
I wasn't scared!
I've been in plenty of fights, okay?
You're huge!
You must weigh like a thousand pounds.
First of all,<br/>I'm wearing a baggy sweater,
and it has horizontal stripes.
And I also...<br/>and I had a salty lunch...
And so I'm retain...<br/>You know what? Shut up!
Wuss!
So,
you just beat those guys up?
Just?
Amanda, were it so simple.<br/>You see,
hand to hand combat is about<br/>so much more than just
administering brute force<br/>on your opponent, right B?
- You know it!<br/>- It's a science.
The sweet science, as it were.
Wait, I'm confused,<br/>what did those guys do to deserve it?
Well, this may sound petty,
- but they sat in our booth.<br/>- They sat in our booth.
- And nobody...<br/>- Nobody.
Sits in our booth.
Are you going to beat those guys up?
Yes, we are going to beat<br/>those guys up. Ted, come on.
You two.<br/>Our booth.
- Get out. Now!<br/>- What are you doing?
Relax, we got Doug.<br/>Big Doug's got our backs.
Yeah, Doug's not here tonight.
Can I get you guys anything?
Drinks? Cash?<br/>Those two girls over there?
Are you Ted Mosby?
- Yeah, I am.<br/>- And you're Barney Stinson?
They've heard of us.
It's cool, guys. We'll let you leave<br/>with your asses unkicked.
This time.<br/>A'ight?
- What's... what's this?<br/>- You've been served.
You're being sued for assault.
Enjoy your booth.
That was close.
Assault!<br/>They're suing us for assault!
Okay, well, what's the penalty<br/>for assault?
What, do I have to pay a fine?
Pick up trash on the highway?
'Cause I've done that before,<br/>know what I mean?
I don't know.
Actually, he did know
that the worst we were looking at<br/>was a small civil settlement,
and probably no criminal charges.
But he was really pissed at us.
I mean, you guys could be looking at<br/>some serious prison time.
- Prison?!<br/>- I can't go to prison!
I mean, I could get a lot<br/>of reading done,
finally write some short stories.
Work out all the time.
Seriously, if I don't come out<br/>of there completely ripped...
We can't go to prison!
People get shivved in the joint!
Plus the meals are really starchy.
Well, you guys should have thought<br/>of that before you beat up those guys.
What if we didn't?
- Didn't what, Ted?<br/>- Didn't beat up those guys.
What if Doug beat up those guys all<br/>by himself
- and we didn't do anything?<br/>- I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!
- You guys didn't throw a single punch.<br/>- Well, I hit Ted and myself, so...
Well, who's the wuss now?<br/>Answer:
You guys.
Look, can you just help us<br/>get out of this?
You know the old expression:<br/>If you're not prepared to do the time
don't pretend to do the crime and laugh
and get free drinks and not stand up<br/>for your friend who, incidentally,
has been in plenty of fights<br/>with his brothers.
Look, you've got to help us out,<br/>Marshall.
We're the Three Musketeers!
If I give up Ted,<br/>how much time am I looking at?
I've been looking for you.
I got... tickets to this hockey game<br/>tonight. It's stupid.
You want to go?
It might go kind of late, so,<br/>maybe, after the game
we can grab a drink.
Get this.<br/>You know that fight?
These guys faked the whole thing.
I forgot!<br/>Tonight is no good.
I can't go to that hockey game<br/>tonight, I got that...
Good news...<br/>I talked to the guys.
- What guys?<br/>- The guys you didn't beat up.
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.
Lawyered.
What? They agreed to drop it?
I just explained that you two<br/>are wusses.
We had a good laugh about that.<br/>A good long laugh, actually.
I explained how you get a<br/>mani/pedi once a month.
Weekly, Wolverine...<br/>some of us care.
And how you played<br/>the hammer dulcimer
in the Pre-Reformation Dance<br/>Society at Wesleyan.
Did you at least tell them<br/>we were one of
the premier Medieval chamber groups<br/>in the Little Ivies?
I did.
And we all agreed<br/>it was much more likely that
one guy beat up the three of them
than that you two had anything<br/>to do with it, so...
Wait, so...
- so now they're only suing Doug.<br/>- Affirmative.
Angry, irrational,
violent Doug,
who now knows we were the ones<br/>who threw him under the bus.
They what?!
- Look, Doug, we can explain...<br/>- Explain what?
Explain how you stabbed me<br/>in the back right to my face?
Robin, I'm scared.
Is Doug seeing anyone?
Are you seeing anyone?<br/>You really should.
Doug, look, you don't understand,
you beat up those guys all by yourself.
It's true, all right? They had nothing<br/>to do with it. I mean...
look at these two.
It was all Ted!
- Look at this guy.<br/>- Yeah, look at me!
He wouldn't last 5 minutes in a fight.
I think I could last at least five...
He's got the muscle definition<br/>of linguini.
Linguini with meatballs maybe...<br/>check it.
- Look!<br/>- Don't.
Okay, you know what,<br/>maybe it was
just me. Actually, you know what,<br/>that makes a lot of sense.
I tend to black out a lot.
Anyway, look,<br/>I always got your back.
All I ask in return<br/>is that you got mine.
But you know what?
You don't.
You can't be counted on.
No wonder your fianc?e left you.
And here it is, kids,<br/>the only fight I've ever been in.
So what can I share<br/>about the experience?
Well, for starters,<br/>when you punch someone in the face,
it hurts your hand...
a lot.
But what hurts even more than that?
This.
And the next thing I remember<br/>was waking up.
I'm all warmed up.<br/>Let's do this thing.
Turns out getting in a fight<br/>was a terrible idea.
And that's my story.
And what did you learn?
Well, I learned that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it ever.
Any questions?
Where do you find these people?
I know! Was there a big sale<br/>at the wuss market?
Wuss!
Of course, I didn't tell those kids<br/>what really happened.
Okay, I'm all warmed up.<br/>Let's do this thing.
What happened?
This happened.
Holy crap!
Turns out Uncle Marshall<br/>and his brothers
did a little more than just roughhouse.
Cocoa break!
Marshall looks good.<br/>Has he lost weight?
Bitch, don't even.
Kids, I'd love to leave you<br/>with the message
that fighting is bad<br/>and you shouldn't do it,
but I know that's pointless.
So, I'll leave you with this:
Don't ever get in a fight<br/>with Uncle Marshall.
That guy's freaking crazy.
It is so good to be home.
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.
"Good food, good meat,<br/>good God, let's eat." Right?
Okay, here we go.<br/>Goggles on.
All right, so,<br/>you guys pass the plates.
Lily, you want white or dark meat?
Dark! Honey, please be careful.

Well, my sister's plane got<br/>in an hour ago,
or as a meteorologist might say,
Hurricane Heather has<br/>just made landfall.
Come on. She's not that bad.
Here's the back<br/>of Heather's baseball card.
It took her six years to graduate<br/>from three different colleges,
during which time she wrecked<br/>two cars, got married for five days,
and lived in a tree for nine weeks,<br/>only to realize
that no one had any intention<br/>of cutting it down.
And now, Heather says<br/>she's moving to New York.
That's big news.
She's never gonna<br/>go through with it.
Remember a few years back when<br/>she talked about transferring to NYU?
And then, on the day<br/>of the admissions interview...
Where's my couch and my TV?
I sold them for<br/>Nine Inch Nails tickets.
The TV alone is worth two grand.
Well, a last-minute plane ticket<br/>is expensive.
- Wait. Where are you?<br/>- Somewhere in Spain.
Gotta go. Slow song.
Oh, crap.
- It's Barney.<br/>- So?
For all the years<br/>Heather's been visiting New York,
Ted's never let Barney meet her.
And I never will.
Every year when the Mosby family<br/>Christmas card shows up...
Pulling down her pants<br/>Yanking off my own
Underneath the mistletoe<br/>I'll make your sister moan
Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot<br/>We'll go all the way...
I wish I could see her naked
I wish I could see her naked
I wish I could see her naked
And down on all fours.
Ted has a little sister<br/>Gets hotter every day
And if I ever meet her<br/>With her boobies I will play!
Everybody!<br/>Sister, sister, sister!
What? I can celebrate<br/>Hanukkah, too.
It's him again.
I should probably get it.
Hey. What's on tap for tonight?
We're heading over<br/>to Marshall and Lily's
for a Kathy Bates movie marathon,<br/>but not Misery.
You wanna join us?
He hung up.
- It's great to see you.<br/>- Hey, kiddo. You look great.
How are things back home?
Well, I moved into your old room.
Did you know that<br/>you can see strange
Mrs. Gottwald's bedroom<br/>across the street?
I am aware of that.<br/>How's she looking?
- Ted, she's 62.<br/>- Answer the question.
Surprisingly perky.
Man, it is cold out there.
Why, hello.
I've been waiting for you.
Wait a second.<br/>That's not our chair.
Did you bring that chair yourself?
I need one that swivels.
How did you even know<br/>Heather was coming into town?
Never tell me anything!
You know I can't keep secrets<br/>around Christmas!
Robin's giving you an iPod!
Can I chat with you<br/>for a sec in the kitchen?
No one touch the chair.<br/>It's a rental.
I can't believe you've been hiding<br/>your sister from me all these years.
Do you blame me?
You're like Weird Al Yankovic
if he only wrote Christmas songs<br/>about banging my sister.
Okay. First of all,<br/>I'm flattered.
Secondly, they're just jokes.
A bro can joke<br/>about another bro's sister.
It doesn't mean<br/>I'm ever gonna act on it.
I love my sister,<br/>and as her older brother,
it's my job to protect her<br/>from guys like you.
You don't trust me, do you?
- And I don't trust her either.<br/>- Fine. Great.
I guess I'll just...
take my chair and go.
Wait... Stop... Come back...
Lily and I are taking Heather out<br/>for dinner on Sunday.
Do you wanna come?
I already called Hurley's<br/>and added a fourth.
- You really can't tell Lily anything.<br/>- No, you can't tell her...
That year, the holidays were really<br/>making Aunt Robin miss Canada,
so Marshall brought her<br/>to the spot
he went whenever he got homesick<br/>for Minnesota:
The Walleye Saloon.
Evening, everybody.
Meet Robin.
Go back to drinking.
- What's up, Marshall?<br/>- Hey, what's u...? Whoa! Bud!
What's with the hitch<br/>in your giddyap?
I was playing some hockey today.
Tore up something in my knee.
Did you go to the hospital?
I just poured some beer on it.
Can't miss the Vikes game.<br/>Twin Cities!
I love the guys here.<br/>They're real men.
No hair products or manicures.
All New York guys are like 10% girl.
Come on.<br/>That seems a little unfair.
I'll have the vichyssoise with just<br/>a soup?on of cr?me fra?che.
Too much dairy<br/>and I tend to bloat.
I found an apartment today.
Really?
And I was hoping you'd have
a little more wine in you before<br/>I asked you this, but...
I need you to co-sign the lease.
Let me think about it.
That means he's not<br/>going to do it.
I could really use your help on this.
Let's talk about this later, okay?
Don't hold your breath.
What is it?
You don't trust me?
You're my sister.
Now he's just stating a fact.
Look, Ted,
I am serious about a career<br/>in finance, but..
You just keep looking at me like I'm
a four-year-old who says<br/>she wants to be an astronaut.
I just don't think<br/>you have any idea
how tough it is to make<br/>it in New York.
Exactly. You need connections.
If only Ted knew someone<br/>who worked at, say...
Goliath National Bank,<br/>then... wait.
What?
I work at Goliath National Bank.<br/>How 'bout that?
All right.
We got two Bemidji Pale Ales and...
who ordered the mini-burgers?
Oh, my God!<br/>Is that Fisherman's Quest?
I used to play FQ<br/>all the time back home!
I kinda have high score.
Not to brag, but I caught...
a 35-inch northern pike.
The biggest video fish<br/>anyone's ever reeled in.
I mean... freshwater.
A tip of the angler's cap, my friend.
Thank you for bringing me here.
Those are mine.
This is not a good idea.
Heather and Barney alone in his office?
And I certainly don't want to be<br/>on the hook for her lease.
She is growing up.<br/>You just can't see it yet.
We're talking about a girl<br/>who was busted for shoplifting
eight months ago.
Ted, a lot of women<br/>go through a shoplifting phase.
And sure, maybe to this day,
they swipe the occasional<br/>smaller item
because it turns them on in a weird way<br/>that they can't quite explain.
But...
if it'll make you feel better,<br/>I'll tag along to GNB tomorrow.
I'll say I'm having lunch<br/>with Marshall,
but actually,<br/>I'll be spying on her and Barney.
I'm good with that.
Good luck tomorrow at GNB.<br/>I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead.
And I'll be spying on you guys.
Damn it!
"I'm drinking till I forget the<br/>1999 NFC Championship"?
That game.
The Vikings were two minutes away<br/>from going to the Super Bowl,
when our kicker, who hadn't missed<br/>all year, shanked a field goal,
and we lost in overtime.<br/>Damn!
'99 NFC Championship game?
Damn!
My dad, who I'd never seen cry my<br/>whole life, wiped away a tear.
He said...
"A little part of me just died, son."
I love how intense you guys are<br/>about your Vikings.
It's like when we watch<br/>hockey night in Canada...
What?
Don't let anyone in here know<br/>that you're not from Minnesota.
Why? What are they gonna do<br/>if they find out I'm from...
Does this look like a Dallas bar<br/>to you, pal?
It's weird, but there's something<br/>comforting about being carried like this.
Man, can you believe that guy?
So, Robin, where are you from?
Bemidji.
Bemidji, Minnesota.<br/>Go, Vikes!
Kids, for what happened next,<br/>I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.
That is a pretty sweet briefcase.
That's a pretty sweet<br/>security camera, too.
And there's another one.<br/>And a guard.
I'm planning on paying for it, Ted.
Well, you don't have the job yet.
That door's a push, not a pull.
There you go.
Thanks again for keeping an eye<br/>on her yesterday.
Look, maybe I was wrong.
She sounds like<br/>she handled Barney just fine.
Maybe she'll be able<br/>to handle New York.
No thanks necessary!
Why not?
I have a secret.<br/>No, I don't!
Nothing happened.<br/>Something happened.
What happened?
Nothing.<br/>After Heather's interview,
I went to say hi to Marshall<br/>for a few minutes,
and when I came back...
Oh, my God!
Before you say or do anything,<br/>I beg you one favor.
What?
Get off that.<br/>It's Prada.
- I am so sorry.<br/>- I knew it.
I knew it all along.<br/>She is still the same,
irresponsible train wreck<br/>that she always was,
- and when I see Barney...<br/>- You won't say a word.
Heather begged me not to tell you.
She will hate my guts<br/>if she knows that I blabbed.
I love that briefcase,<br/>but I can't afford it.
You were right, Ted.
- I certainly was.<br/>- See?
She didn't get the briefcase!<br/>That's responsible!
And there's almost no way she<br/>had sex with anyone in there.
Turning over a new leaf.
Evening, everybody!
So my dad and I are at the<br/>'99 NFC Championship game.
I say evening, everybody!
And when we missed that<br/>field goal and lost...
- Damn!<br/>- Damn...
my dad, who I had never seen cry<br/>in my entire life,
wiped away a tear and said,
"A little part of me just died, son."
"Son"?
I told it the way<br/>I'm gonna tell my son.
If I'm ever lucky enough<br/>to have a son,
and name him
Rashad Tarkenton.
- Great story.<br/>- Great story!
But it does sound<br/>a little bit familiar.
I know!
They totally ate it up.
- I see what you're doing here.<br/>- What?
I brought you here as a favor<br/>because...
because I felt sorry for you, okay?
And now it's like you're trying<br/>to steal my bar.
You think I'm trying<br/>to steal your bar?
- Get oot.<br/>- "Get oot"?
- What, are you Canadian?<br/>- No, I...
If you want to impersonate a Canadian,
just turn of the lights<br/>and get all scared!
What was that?
Well, with Canada right across<br/>the border,
we Minnesotans sometimes like<br/>to make jokes
at your guys' expense and they're all<br/>sort of along the same theme.
That we're afraid of the dark?
For example:
Hey, everyone, how many Canadians<br/>does it take to change a lightbulb?
"What? Oh, no, the lightbulb's out?!<br/>I'm scared!"
That is insane.
Why do you think the Canadians<br/>are afraid of the dark?
Where does any prejudice<br/>come from, Robin?
A stereotype starts, and all of a sudden<br/>it spreads like wildfire. Like
Asians can't drive,<br/>Scotsmen are cheap,
Brazilians always put on way<br/>too much postage.
I just don't think this is gonna<br/>work out, Robin.
You can't be hanging out<br/>with people who
belittle your beloved homeland, so
I'll walk you out.
Wait, I have something to say.
Hey, everybody.
Let me tell you something<br/>about people from Canada.
Please don't make a scene.
Do you know why Canadians<br/>never get a birthday wish?
Because they're too afraid<br/>to blow out the candles.
Oh, God, I love it here. God.
I think your prospects<br/>at GNB are good.
You certainly made it clear<br/>you're will to take any position.
Are these new coasters?
Well, I hope you get the job.
Nothing gives me more pleasure than<br/>filling an opening.
I swear to God<br/>these coasters are thicker.
Well, I am willing to bend<br/>over backwards.
That's it! I cannot believe<br/>you had sex with my sister!
- You blabbed?!<br/>- Do you know what?
This is a new batch<br/>of the old coasters.
I'm just gonna confirm that<br/>with the bartender.
And you, you're mature<br/>and responsible now?
Is it mature and responsible
to go to your first big job<br/>interview in New York City
and nail a total stranger?
You've always been<br/>immature and irresponsible.
You will always be<br/>immature and irresponsible.
And I wouldn't cosign a library card<br/>for you, let alone a lease.
- Barney and I didn't have sex.<br/>- Save it. Lily saw you.
Or did she?
You see, Ted, you had so little faith<br/>in Heather and me...
We decided to give you<br/>exactly what you expected of us.
And I knew we could<br/>count on Lily to blab.
Oh, my God!
What? Why would you do that?
Because you deserved it.
You know I'm no saint.
And yes, it's true that time I drove<br/>your mother to the airport,
well, let's just say there was a
very confusing, sexually charged<br/>moment in short-term parking,
but I said I would never<br/>go near your sister,
and I meant it.
You should have trusted me.
You're so convinced I'm still<br/>some out-of-control teenager,
you missed the fact I grew up.
I'm gonna find a hotel.
I'll get my things later.
Merry Christmas.
Your mom and I kissed.
Better get a move on.
You got five seconds<br/>to catch two more sturgeon.
We got a possible gill screen.
Forget it. You can't catch two fish<br/>with one hook.
But I can catch one fish
and use that fish<br/>to catch the other one.
High score! You beat Marshall!
She's Canadian!
Robin's Canadian!
She's Canadian.
She's not from Bemidji and she doesn't<br/>know a darn thing about the Vikings.
You're just mad<br/>'cause she got high score.
In the '99 NFC Championship game<br/>when the Vikings lost...
- Damn!<br/>- Oh, damn!
Who was the kicker<br/>who missed the field goal?
He's now retired.<br/>Owns a fly-fishing business...
in Canada.
Good-bye, Robin.
You know what?
I'm glad you found oot
because I'm proud to be Canadian.
We may not have<br/>a fancy NFL team or Prince,
but we invented Trivial Pursuit.
You're welcome, Earth!
Plus in Canada,<br/>you can go to an all-nude strip club
and order alcohol.
That's right.
From Moosejaw to the Bay of Fundy,<br/>you can suck down a 20-ounce pilsner
while watching some coal miner's daughter<br/>strip down to her pelt.
Jealous?!
In Canada people don't care<br/>where you're from,
as long as you're friendly and<br/>maybe loan them a smoke or
hand over a donut.
I'm proud to be<br/>from the Great White North...
and I wish<br/>I was there right now.
And we're not afraid of the dark.
I mean, we don't love it,<br/>but who does?
Merry Christmas.
Look inside.
You just,
if you push it towards the...<br/>not down, towards the middle.
- Don't need your help.<br/>- Got it.
You signed the lease.
You know why?
Because you trust me<br/>and think it's a great idea?
Because I want<br/>to get to know you.
The new you.
By the way,<br/>in your new neighborhood,
you really should get a<br/>good solid deadbolt for the door.
If you want...
to live.
I'm so sorry for what happened<br/>back there.
I acted like a total jerk.
- I shouldn't have said anything.<br/>- No, look, I'msorry.
That was your place.<br/>I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.
Just every year at the holidays,<br/>I get homesick.
And so far, every year<br/>I've had a reason to stay,
a boyfriend, a job,
or something.
But this year for the first time,<br/>I don't.
Yes, you do.
What?
We all love you, okay?
If you ever moved back to Canada,<br/>we would hop on a plane,
we would track you down, and
after Barney dragged us to a few<br/>of those strip clubs you talked about,
we would bring you back right here<br/>where you're supposed to be. It's...
it's not New York<br/>without Robin Scherbatsky.
I just miss it there sometimes.
I wish I could blink my eyes and be back<br/>in Canada for an hour, you know?
I was hoping you would say that.
Once, there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change<br/>With the girls
- in the change room...<br/>- How did you find this place?
- Feels like home, right?<br/>- There's one way to find out.
Well, sorry there. Didn't see ya.<br/>Are you okay?
- I'm fine.<br/>- Okay, sorry aboot that.
Have a donut on the hoose.
You bumped into him,<br/>and he apologized
and gave you a donut on the hoose?
It's just like home.
It's gonna be fine!
No one likes the dark.
Next up from Ontario,
Marshall Erickson.
I didn't know you signed up.<br/>What are you gonna sing?
I think you'll recognize it.
But that's okay,<br/>I'm gonna rock your body anyway
I'm gonna rock your body<br/>till Canada Day!
Buddy, you can turn off the screen.<br/>We know the lyrics.
Everybody come and play
Throw every last care away
Let's go to the mall
today!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the winter of 2009,
aunt Robin and I<br/>had just become roommates.
And to be honest,<br/>it wasn't going very smoothly.
That looks good.<br/>I'm gonna get some.
- There's no more milk.<br/>- No, I just saw some in the fridge.
Empty.
So throw it out.
The trash can's full.
So take the trash out.
I'm eating cereal.
You know, when I asked you<br/>to be my roommate, I figured,
"She's a girl,<br/>she'll be neat."
But no, you're Ogre<br/>from Revenge of the Nerds.
You know what, Ted?
Instead of coming up with hot off<br/>the press topical references like that,
maybe you should spend a little time,<br/>I don't know,
washing a dish ever.
Darn, I can't.
I'm too busy leaving a plate of cookies
for the magical elf<br/>who changes the toilet paper roll.
Wait, there's no elf.
- It's always me!<br/>- I always change it.
- You never do it!<br/>- That is ridiculous!
- No, I went in there yesterday...<br/>- I changed it the last five times.
God, what is going on?
When we were dating each other,<br/>we were practically living together
and we didn't drive<br/>each other this crazy.
I know.
What happened?
You know what it is?
We were having sex.
Men and women need sex<br/>to live together.
It solves all disputes.
Like Barney's theory<br/>about world peace?
So I explained to her.<br/>I said, Madeline,
every single international conflict
essentially boils down<br/>to sexual tension.
- Every international conflict?<br/>- Every single one, dude.
So the crisis in the Middle East<br/>could be solved by...
Gaza Strippers. Next.
- Apartheid?<br/>- Apart thighs.
- What else you got?<br/>- Cold War?
"Mrs. Gorbachev,<br/>take down those pants."
Guess we should just start<br/>having sex, then.
Yeah, right.
I know.
It's like riding a bike, buddy?
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.
Okay, listen.<br/>If this is gonna happen on occasion,
we can't tell anyone about this.
- Deal?<br/>- Deal.
Deal.
Sync by vNaru
What the hell are you guys doing?
What, are you guys, like,<br/>back together?
We're just having sex<br/>so we don't fight anymore.
That's a great idea.<br/>No, really.
Two thumbs up, guys.
I just looked into the future
and that works out<br/>really great for everyone.
What are you even doing here?
I was on my way to work and<br/>I just had to drop by here to...
read this magazine.
In...<br/>that room over there.
I get it.<br/>No problem, buddy.
Yes, a problem, buddy.
You came all the way over here<br/>to read a magazine?
I'm willing to bet that<br/>there is a place to
read a magazine at work.
You know, a room<br/>with a little man on the door?
Come on. Nobody likes to read<br/>a magazine at work.
I mean, you walk out of your office<br/>holding a magazine
and that magazine is saying<br/>one thing and one thing only.
Hey everyone, look at what<br/>Marshall's about to do!
Marshall's about to read a big<br/>ol' magazine in the bathroom
that you all share with him.
Well, have you thought about maybe
not reading a magazine<br/>when you read a magazine?
You gotta read a magazine.<br/>I mean,
that's why there's magazines.
Otherwise, it's just time<br/>you're not getting back.
Exactly.
And the worst part is this:
That stretch of hallway from my door<br/>to that restroom
is a...
gauntlet of...
judging eyes.
You got my boss.
We all know exactly<br/>what you're about to do.
Her boss.
Why don't you just move<br/>your desk in there?
I can't believe he has a wife Donald.
Sweetie, so obvious.
Anyways, I just would<br/>rather do that here.
No, I'm sorry.<br/>This is our apartment now.
You have to read a magazine<br/>someplace else.
- Give me your key.<br/>- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
I seem to recall a deal<br/>being struck between three parties
where in none would discuss<br/>a certain
event that transpired.
An event of the...
...persuasion.<br/>That key, madam,
buys my silence.
Good day to you both.
You two hooked up?
Thanks a lot, Lily.
So,
you two...
slept together.
That is awf...
some.
Awfsome.
Nice work, Ted. Tap that.
It sounds like<br/>a bigger deal than it is.
We talked it over and<br/>we both realized
we've had a rough couple of months.
We deserve a little fun.
This could wind up<br/>ruing your friendship.
When two exes try to<br/>"just be casual,"
someone always winds up<br/>getting hurt.
Turned out, Lily was right.
But more on that later.
Look, guys,<br/>we've got this covered, okay?
No one's gonna get hurt.<br/>We set up ground rules.
Rule number one, this is strictly<br/>a physical relationship.
There are no feelings involved, okay?
Please, that's like telling<br/>the Fonz to be cool.
And since it's just physical, we don't<br/>have to worry about romance, right?
Hell, no.<br/>We can do it while we watch TV!
Totally!
And we can multi-task.<br/>You know,
use the sex to spice up<br/>otherwise dull activities.
Like folding laundry.
- Paying bills.<br/>- Cooking dinner.
- That doesn't seem hygienic.<br/>- Yeah, not that one.
And now that we're hooking up,<br/>we're not fighting anymore.
Problem solved.<br/>Actually, the credit belongs to Barney.
This whole idea came out of<br/>your thing about world peace.
You were right.<br/>Peace was achieved.
Repeatedly.
So I'm...<br/>responsible for...
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
Next round's on me!
- Are you okay?<br/>- Yeah. Why do you ask?
Well, for one thing,<br/>you're openly weeping.
With joy.
So happy for those two.
Barney, admit it.
You still have feelings for Robin<br/>and this is killing you.
I am totally fine.
Now, excuse me for just a minute.
I'm totally fine.
You have to learn<br/>how to express these feelings.
Maybe you should talk<br/>to a psychiatrist.
Please.
If I'm gonna pay some woman<br/>$200 an hour
to make me feel better,<br/>we aren't going to be talking.
And we're both going to be<br/>on that couch.
The woman in this<br/>scenario is a prostitute.
A dirty, skanky, surgically enhanced,<br/>Eastern European...
I got it.
And there's something kind of liberating<br/>about not taking it all too seriously.
Last night, we actually did it
while I was returning<br/>a bunch of phone calls.
I knew you didn't get<br/>a rowing machine!
Awesome,<br/>we're still talking about this!
Look, guys, this is a private thing<br/>between me and Ted.
Private Thing.
We wouldn't even be talking<br/>about this if Marshall
could read a magazine at work.
He's always been this way.<br/>Remember law school?
Sure do.
Baby, what is it?
The credit card bill came today.
You checked into a hotel
two blocks from school<br/>on a Tuesday.
It's not what you think.
Who is she, Marshall?<br/>What's her name?
Burrito.
Carnitas Burrito.
So, you checked into a hotel room
just so you could read<br/>a magazine there?
Hey, Robin, do you want me<br/>to see if the waitress has any
giant sugar cubes<br/>for that high horse of yours?
Nobody likes to read a magazine<br/>at work and if they say that they do,
then they're not human.
Dude, I read a magazine<br/>at work every day.
I can't tell you how many meetings<br/>I've been late to
because I was busy<br/>"reading a magazine."
But I don't feel bad about it.<br/>That's my time.
Sure, "reading a magazine"<br/>ain't pretty,
but, you know,<br/>it's something I gotta do.
So why be ashamed about it?
Wait, "reading a magazine"<br/>means masturbating, right?
I can't believe it.
You drank all my milk again!
- We can have sex.<br/>- Okay.
It's the perfect set up.
Anytime we start getting<br/>into an argument,
we just have sex instead.
One minute we're just laying into<br/>each other, and then the next minute...
Well, same thing.
Awesome.
So, this morning, she's yelling<br/>at me through the door,
"You're taking too long in the shower!"
Next thing I know, she hops in.
Now baby? Don't mind<br/>I took my time.
So awesome.
Sorry I'm late.
I was just jammin' on Scherbatsky.
She used up all my stamps,<br/>so long story short,
the postman rang twice.
You must bump this!
That's...
just...
so...
Excuse me for a second.
So, you're saying plasmas<br/>are better for low light,
but LCDs are better for games?
Right, but the CRTs<br/>have the truest blacks.
So, if I want a really<br/>crisp contrast ratio...
The CRT's deep-pixel cell structure
produces a resolution<br/>you just can't match with an LCD.
I'll take the CRT.
Barney, this is nuts.
I'm doing just fine, thank you.
No, you're not.
You need to learn to let this stuff out.
Like we do in my kindergarten class
"Feelings Hour" every Tuesday morning.
Look, Lily, maybe your<br/>kindergartners are upset that
their friends are sleeping with<br/>each other, but not me.
I have never been better.
Meanwhile, Marshall was still<br/>struggling at work.
Coming through.
Big breakfast this morning.
You know what that means.
But then came the best news<br/>he'd heard in a long time.
And did you hear?
They laid off<br/>everybody on the eighth floor.
I know. It's a ghost town down there.
- Morning.<br/>- Morning.
Hey, that was fun last night.
Word, that was a good one.
Mental note: don't throw out<br/>the pizza box more often.
All right, see you later.
So, last night, Robin left a pizza box<br/>out on the floor,
- so we had sex three times.<br/>- Sure.
And then, this morning<br/>before I left for work...
- we kissed.<br/>- That's weird.
That is weird.
Right?
That kiss violated the spirit<br/>of our whole arrangement. I mean,
she probably thinks<br/>I'm getting feelings for her.
Well, are you?
Yes, I'm in love with her.
Is what you...<br/>That's you, dude.
No. It didn't mean anything.
It was just some leftover reflex<br/>from when we were a couple.
But I think I probably blew it.
Definitely.
It is so over.
Hold the phone. Maybe Robin<br/>didn't think it was weird.
It was weird.<br/>Weird...
W-I-E-R-D. Weird.
That's not how you spell "weird."
Come on, Lily.<br/>Nobody likes a Ted.
I tried to warn you.
When exes relapse,<br/>someone always gets hurt.
But no one listened.
Story of my life.
My cuteness interferes with people<br/>hearing my message.
Well, what should I do?
There's only one thing to do.
You have to stop sleeping together,<br/>please.
I think we have to stop<br/>sleeping together.
With me and Ted,<br/>it's like cigarettes.
You have one when you're drunk<br/>and you think it's fine.
But before you know it,<br/>you're buying a carton a week.
I think I have to end it.
I have to end it.
So...
We're ending it...?
I think so, yeah.
It's probably for the best.
It was fun, but
- I don't want things to get weird.<br/>- Me neither.
- Roomies?<br/>- Roomies.
But we tell no one.
Deal?
- Deal.<br/>- Deal.
- Dude!<br/>- Come on!
What is the matter with you?
That one.
So, that didn't last long.
By the way, Marshall, what were<br/>you doing back in our apartment?
I thought you had<br/>the perfect situation.
I did.
Everything was going great.
I was feeling more comfortable,<br/>more confident.
I felt I could take on the world.
One morning, I took my magazine<br/>down to the eighth floor.
We gotta gut this whole place.
I need these walls taken out
here
and here.
You got it.
Celebrities pick up their dry cleaning?
I pick up my dry cleaning.
Don't come in!
So that didn't last long.
- Thanks.<br/>- What are you doing?
Well, since all these
roomie squabbles<br/>are still causing friction
between you and Robin,<br/>I thought I'd help out.
BTW, I went by the post office today.
I picked you up some stamps.
Here's ten thousand.<br/>That oughta do.
Thanks, I guess.
You want a beer?
Yeah, I picked those up on the way over.<br/>It was nothing.
Did you buy us a dishwasher?
That dishwasher's always been there.<br/>How long have you lived here?
So, you're doing all this to keep<br/>me and Robin from fighting, huh?
Exactly.
I worry about you two.
It bothers you that Robin and I<br/>are hooking up, doesn't it?
Not at all.<br/>That's crazy.
What?
Are you in love with Robin?
You're in love with Robin.
That's why you don't want us<br/>hooking up.
What? That is crazy talk.
Can't a bro clean another bro's<br/>apartment like bros do?
Name me one bro in the history of bros<br/>who has ever done that.
I'll name two,
Misters Clean and Belvedere.
Look, this thing with me and Robin,<br/>it's totally casual.
I'm not gonna freak out if you tell me<br/>you have feelings for her.
So, do you?
No. No, I don't. I don't, no.<br/>I don't. I don't. No.
Robin is all yours, dude.<br/>Have fun with her.
Now, if you'll excuse me,<br/>I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.
- Are you sure?<br/>- Yes!
Positive?
Absolutely.
And then I stormed out.
Why did I do that?
I mean, maybe it goes back<br/>to my father issues, but...
I basically gave my best friend license
to have sex with the girl of my dreams.
I totally sabotaged myself.
And now I'm smoking.
Now I'm smoking.
Get out.
But it's feelings hour<br/>and I'm holding Feely the Share Bear.
And whoever's holding<br/>Feely the Share Bear
gets to sit in the share chair.
Barney, this is not your private<br/>therapist's office.
These kids have issues<br/>to talk about, too, you know.
Ben's parents are getting divorced.
They are?
Who wants to do some coloring?
Great, did Lily send you?<br/>I don't have the bear, okay?
I'm not giving it back!
Why are you smiling?
I just...
read a magazine.
Here at work.
What?
Yeah. It's the funniest thing.
I was online,<br/>looking up rates for hotels
when I realized something.
This is stupid.
I decided it was time to let go<br/>of my hang-ups and
do the thing I gotta do<br/>and once I made that decision,
everything changed.
There's a young man<br/>who's comfortable with who he is.
I know what you're about to do<br/>and I respect you for it.
Hey, Eriksen.<br/>Go the distance.
You made a brave step today.
Remember what<br/>Shakespeare wrote,
"Virtue is bold,<br/>and goodness never fearful."
You're right,
Super hot lady who my wife<br/>keeps telling me why you're famous
but I keep forgetting.
Let's do this.
Lead the way.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I was gonna have to do it eventually.<br/>You know, sometimes you just gotta...
you gotta man up and...
and just go for it.
I have to go.
By the way, I have a bathroom here<br/>if you ever want to use it.
Son of a...
I have to tell you the truth.
I'm in love with...<br/>tacos.
What are you doing?
I'm taking out the triz-ash.
If you're... looking for Ted, he left.
And...
our little arrangement is... over,
- by the way.<br/>- Really? That's awes... ful.
- Awfsful?<br/>- Yeah, it's just awfsful.
What happened?
He just insisted.
He said he couldn't do it anymore<br/>because "someone's gonna get hurt."
I think we all know<br/>who he meant by that.
Do we?
Isn't it obvious?
Is it?
It's Ted.
You know what a romantic he is.
He can't separate the physical<br/>from the emotional.
- He's all like...<br/>- I love you.
Exactly.
He's not like you, you know?
Besides, we're friends.
I don't want to screw that up<br/>by getting involved.
Dating friends never works out.
So... you want to get a taco?
A taco?
You love them, rember?
Right.
Come on, I'm hungry.
So Robin and I went back<br/>to just being roommates
and things went back to normal.
Your Aunt Lily was right.
When two exes decide to just be casual,
someone always gets hurt.
It just wasn't one of us.

[<div class="full-script">In order to get the most out of this course, there are a few things you're going to need.
First of all, you need a basic understanding of programming.
This means that you need experience writing working code in a modern
programming language,
for example, Perl, PHP, Java, JavaScript, C++, or any modern programming
language, and you need some understanding of object-oriented programming.
You don't necessarily need to be an expert, but you need to at least have an
understanding of what it is, and why it is.
You will need to have a text editor.
A text editor is not a word processor.
When you edit text using a word processor, the word processor adds other
information to the file, information about formatting, layout, fonts, things like these.
These things will make the program not work.
You cannot edit program code in a word processor.
You need a plain text text editor and there are lots of them available on every platform.
For the purposes of this course, we're going to be using an integrated
development environment called Eclipse for our text editor.
You do not need to use Eclipse.
Use whatever text editor you're comfortable with.
Use whatever coding environment you're comfortable with.
The reason that I'm using Eclipse in this course is for the purposes of instruction.
It runs on every platform and it allows me to demonstrate running the code in
the same environment.
You don't need to use an integrated environment like that.
You can use a plain text editor.
Finally, you'll need a system with Python 3 installed, and I strongly recommend
Python 3.1 or later.
The examples in this course are using Python 3.1.
Python 3 is a significant upgrade from Python 2.
Code written in Python 2 will not necessarily work in Python 3, and vice versa.
It's essentially the same language, but there are some significant differences,
and this course is about Python 3.
Python 3 is easy to get and to install. Installers are available for most
operating systems, and you can find an installer for your operating system
at this URL.

[<div class="full-script">I can't believe Metro News One is just<br/>forwarding you all this fan mail now.
I know.<br/>I quit like four months ago.
You had more fans than I thought.
And only about 60% of them<br/>are prison inmates.
What are these guys thinking?
I am way past<br/>my "dating prisoners" phase.
It's like, hello, I'm not 19 anymore.
Lottery Girl's on.
I just feel sorry for these women.
This is where broadcast<br/>careers go to die.
Check it out. I make it fun.<br/>I invented a little game.
Tonight's Lotto numbers are...
nineteen...
Age you moved to New York<br/>after a photographer "discovered" you
at a food court and said<br/>he'd get you in Vogue magazine.
Fifty-three...
Number of semi-nude pictures<br/>he took of you
before you realized he had<br/>no connection to Vogue magazine.
Twenty-two...
Age you claim you are.
Thirty-one...
Age you actually are.
Forty-five...
Number of minutes it would take<br/>me to get you into a cab,
out of your dress,<br/>and into my Jacuzzi.
And the Super Big Ball is...
What happens after we get out<br/>of the Jacuzzi.
What up?
Sync by vNaru
Kids, by the winter of 2009,
Robin had been<br/>unemployed for months.
But there was a glimmer of hope.
How'd the audition go?
Well, I went in there<br/>feeling really good.
I heard it was just me<br/>up against two other girls.
Listening.
And you are?
You've obviously never spent<br/>any time in Denver.
Rochelle Harper,<br/>News Center 12.
We were only the number-one station<br/>in the Rockies for
five straight years.
I was an anchor here in town<br/>at Metro News One.
An anchor.
You must have a killer signoff phrase.
I'm sorry?
You gotta have a killer signoff phrase.
Like Walter Cronkite.
"And that's the way it is."
So what's yours?
Well, I would just always end<br/>with a simple
"From all of us here at Metro News One,<br/>have a good evening."
Mine is: "From all of us here<br/>at Barney's apartment, get out."
You didn't let those reporter bitches<br/>psych you out, did you?
...and the President's economic team<br/>is hoping to have a proposal
before Congress<br/>by the end of the month.
From all of us here at News Ten,<br/>have a good evening.
So, good night, New York.
And may the road ahead<br/>be lit with dreams
and tomorrows.
Which are lit with dreams...
also.
That's terrible.
And bad...
also.
I wasn't done.
Stand tall, New York.
Trustworthy.
Recycling.
Wear a condom.
Wear a condom?
I'm not gonna be the new<br/>Channel Ten anchor, am I?
This just in.
Maybe the problem is your r?sum?.
See how mine is lean and mean?
Yours is too cluttered.
Like everything on your r?sum?<br/>is so relevant?
"Program Director,<br/>88.1 Wesleyan University Radio"?
- Oh, God.<br/>- Dr. X?
You're still bragging about Dr. X?
- Who was Dr. X?<br/>- Nobody knows.
- He was this genius mystery D.J.<br/>- It was Ted.
His identity remains a secret<br/>to this day.
It was Ted.
But this phantom of the airwaves changed<br/>the very face of college radio.
- It was Ted.<br/>- And your show sucked.
Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets<br/>at you from an undisclosed location.
Because if they knew where I was,<br/>they'd shut me down.
You're on the third floor<br/>of the Student Center
next to the game room, you tool.
I've been getting a lot of letters<br/>about my segment
on how racist<br/>the school's meal plan is.
How are you getting letters<br/>if no one knows where you are, douche?
That's why I'm organizing a happening
outside the dining hall,<br/>Monday at midnight.
It's high time the Food Service<br/>puppet masters
took ignorance and injustice<br/>off the menu.
Hey, Ted, we need<br/>a fourth for foosball.
What are you doing in here, anyway?
Dude, get out of here!<br/>I'll be there in a second.
So remember, dining hall,<br/>monday, midnight.
Another Dr. X happening.
I'll be there, because X<br/>marks the spot-ot-ot-ot-ot...
If you think people liked your show,<br/>they did not-ot-ot-ot...
This is weird.
Look what got mixed in<br/>with your fan mail.
What?
It's from the<br/>U.S. Department of Immigration.
It's postmarked two months ago.
- Oh, boy.<br/>- What is it?
It's about my work visa.
Unless I can find a job in the next...
seven days,
they're gonna send me back to Canada.
I can't believe you might be<br/>kicked out of the country.
I know. My whole life is here.
We won't let this happen. I mean,<br/>one of us will help you find a job.
I bet I can get you something<br/>at my school.
It doesn't work that way.<br/>Robin only gets her work visa
if she gets a job in her field.
I mean, you know what,<br/>I guess you could stay
if you married a U.S. citizen.
Yeah, that could work.
They could never process that and make<br/>it official in time. That won't work.
I'm screwed.
I've been sending out my reel<br/>for three months, and nothing.
Well, maybe there's something in your<br/>reel that people aren't responding to.
Let's take a look at it, right?
That's a good question, Norm.
The first thing is from<br/>when I was a cub reporter
for Channel 22 in Red Deer.
In Alberta.
In Canada.
Well, the snow's coming down<br/>pretty hard,
but these intrepid fishermen<br/>are still happy to be out competing
in Lake Athabasca's<br/>Bass Fishing Jamboree,
an August 1st tradition.
Back to you, Norm.
What?
That was my first job.<br/>It shows where I came from.
Unless a bear attacks you<br/>in the next three seconds
and you snap its neck<br/>with your legs,
that has no business being<br/>on your reel.
I get it, I get it.
Where you're from is part<br/>of who you're selling.
For instance, under "special skills"<br/>on my r?sum?,
I mention that back in Minnesota,
I was the 1995 Nicollet County<br/>Slam Dunk Champion.
You put dunk champion<br/>on your r?sum??
Yeah, why wouldn't you?
A lot of companies have<br/>basketball teams.
It's good for them to know
that Vanilla Thunder can still take<br/>the rock to the hole.
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?<br/>- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.
The Ghost in the Post.<br/>The Human Turnstile.
I didn't...<br/>play that much D.
You can't still dunk.
Of course I can.
Well, I mean I could...<br/>until... recently.
Until the injury.
It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.
Yikes, that sounds bad.
It's more commonly known<br/>as dancer's hip.
Dr. Goodman...
Come on!
Iliopsoas tendonitis.<br/>That's what it's called.
That's all it's called.
Iliopsoas tendonitis.
It's a basketball injury.<br/>You know, it's no big whoop.
Dancer's hip, Marshall has something<br/>called dancer's hip.
They only call it that, look, because<br/>it's very common with ballet dancers.
So, tell me, do any of the other<br/>little girls in your class
- have dancer's hip?<br/>- Yeah, sure.
I have more of a technical question.
Is it easier to dance when<br/>you don't have external genitalia?
Good, don't build to that...<br/>just go right for it.
Guys, come on. Marshall didn't get<br/>this injury from dancing.
Thank you, Lily.
Clearly, the stirrups<br/>were set a little too wide
during his last trip to the gyno.
Guys, I hate to cut you off
before Marshall bursts<br/>into tears, but,
Robin, check this out.<br/>What you need is an awesome
video
r?sum?.
Like... mine.
I present,
You've achieved great success<br/>in business,
athletics and personal relationships
and have been an inspiration<br/>to many people.
Is that you?
Are you interviewing yourself?
How can it be me?<br/>That guy's British.
What would you recommend<br/>to your numerous admirers
who want to reach<br/>their highest potential?
And a wee bit Scottish.
The first thing you need<br/>to know about success
is that it doesn't<br/>just come to you.
Most people associate success<br/>with money and power,
but really<br/>it's a state of mind.
You had to be on a motorcycle<br/>to say that?
And when it comes to success<br/>the only limit
is that there are no limits.
I didn't know you knew how to stand<br/>near a horse, that's impressive.
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do<br/>a damn thing in any of these clips.
Exactly.
Because that's who<br/>corporate American wants...
people who seem<br/>like bold risk takers,
but never actually do anything.
Actually doing things<br/>gets you fired.
In fact, I'm writing a book<br/>on this very phenomenon.
Really, you're writing a book?
That would be doing some...<br/>Are you even listening?!
All my life,
I have dared to go
past what is possible.
To the impossible?
Actually, past that...
to the place where the possible
and the impossible meet<br/>to become...
the possimpible.
The possimpible?<br/>Really?
Inventing your own word shows<br/>creativity and vision...
"Visiativity."
If I can leave you with one thought,
it's this.
Nothing...
and everything...
is possimpible.
That guy's awesome
Is that you agai...?
Are you singing a song<br/>about yourself?
Absolutely not.<br/>That would be lame.
Stinson, Barney Stinson<br/>singing this song
That would be really lame
One of the many admirers who<br/>think that guy's awesome
perfect and available
That baby got me 11 job offers.
No way.
- That was ridiculous and insane.<br/>- Insanulous.
- Make me one.<br/>- What?
- Now you're talking.<br/>- What?
I'm about to be deported.<br/>I'll try anything.
We better get started.
There's a lot to shoot,<br/>and I don't think I can use
any of the footage<br/>I already have of you.
What footage do you<br/>already have of me?
Let's just get started.
Sweetie. Are you still upset<br/>about the dancer's hip jokes?
We were just kidding.<br/>We all know it's a basketball injury.
Totally.
Lily, I have something<br/>I need to tell you.
What is it?
I dance more than you know.
What?
I dance...
more than you know.
I don't know how to respond to that.
So,
what does being a reporter<br/>mean to you?
Well, ever since I was a little kid,
- I always...<br/>- Cut!
You're getting bogged down<br/>in specifics.
I need you to just say vague,
confident-sounding buzzwords,<br/>like "synergy" and "dynamism."
You can make up a word,<br/>like... "linkativity."
How will sounding like an idiot<br/>get me hired anywhere?
Okay, fine.<br/>Don't do it.
Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of<br/>exciting stories to cover back in Canada.
I just read that the mayor of<br/>Winnipeg's nephew went ice fishing
and caught himself a 16-pound walleye.
Reporting live from the worst place<br/>in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
Fine.
Roll camera.
- Connectitude.<br/>- Love it.
- Transformatation.<br/>- Earn it!
Linkativity.
Linkativity's mine.
So, how much dancing<br/>are we talking about?
I don't...
I guess I'd say...
medium.
Why are you dancing so much,<br/>and why don't I know about it?
It's... something I do when I'm alone.
You know, like if something<br/>good happens, I get excited
and I need to move, and I just...
I don't know. I don't want<br/>to even talk about this anymore.
So that's how you injured your hip?
Did you hear? They're giving us<br/>a half day today.
- We can leave at 2:00.<br/>- Oh! Great!
Thanks, Herm.
These costumes are ridiculous.
Plus, the Amazon Warrior Princess armor<br/>gave me a rash.
Cards on the table... you weren't<br/>the first lady to wear that in here.
But it conveyed power.<br/>And so will this.
What I need you to do now...
is break these 15 bricks<br/>with your forehead.
What?! But you didn't do<br/>a damn thing in your video.
You just stood near a horse<br/>and sat on a motorcycle.
That's because I'm a man.<br/>You're a woman.
The assumption is that<br/>you can't do anything.
But you have to prove society wrong.
I can't break 15 bricks<br/>with my forehead.
It's not 1950 anymore.<br/>Yes, you can.
- I'm out of here.<br/>- What? Why?
None of this is going to help me<br/>get a job.
I'm about to get kicked<br/>out of the country.
I know what I have to do.
Is this where the Lottery Girl<br/>auditions are?
Right here.
So kids, your Aunt Robin<br/>had reached her low point.
She was auditioning<br/>to be the Lottery Girl.
- And tonight's Lotto numbers are...<br/>- Hold it.
Say the line before<br/>you press the button.
- It builds the suspense.<br/>- It builds the suspense.
And tonight's Lotto numbers are...
- seventeen...<br/>- Stop her.
Hold it.
Why did she say it like that?
It's like she's not even happy<br/>about the 17 coming up.
- She seems mean.<br/>- Yeah, she seems super-mean.
Can you take another run<br/>at "17" for us?
Seventeen.
I don't even understand<br/>what she's doing.
Let me try something.
Try being a little more wry.
Wry?<br/>About the number 17?
Wry, with a little bit of a...
- Twinkle.<br/>- ...twinkle.
Seventeen.
That was great!
I got you a light beer.
I know how you dancers are<br/>always counting calories.
It's not funny, all right?
The doctor says if it gets any worse,<br/>I might need surgery.
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?
You know who didn't do a lot of<br/>operating on vaginas in college?
- Dr. X.<br/>- He did just fine!
You know what?
Both of you geniuses need to take<br/>that weak-ass crap off your r?sum?s.
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,<br/>and you cannot dunk anymore.
Let it go.
So Marshall and I are the only people<br/>at this table with
"weak-ass crap" on their r?sum?s?
What are you implying?
I don't know! Does the date July 4,<br/>1995 mean anything to you?
You son of a bitch.
Time!
And the new champion,<br/>with 29 hot dogs,
Lily "The Belly" Aldrin.
How is that relevant<br/>to teaching kindergarten?
It teaches kids that...
I can eat a lot of hot dogs<br/>very quickly.
But you can't do it anymore!
You can't dunk anymore, Ladyhips!
How dare you!
- These hips can...<br/>- Guys, guys!
I didn't even get the Lotto Girl gig.
I have to move back to Canada.
I can't believe this.
I remember the night<br/>before I moved down here.
They threw a going-away party for me.
They gave me a camera so I could<br/>take pictures and send them home.
And everyone was so sure<br/>I was gonna be such a big success.
I'm really gonna miss you guys.
What happened?
Robin has to move back to Canada.
Oh, my God.<br/>How awful.
I mean, for one thing it's gonna be<br/>a really long commute.
What do you mean?
I finished your video r?sum? on my own.
Messengered it to every station<br/>in the city.
A guy from Channel Eight called.<br/>He loved you.
He wanted you to come in and audition.
I told him no. Robin Scherbatsky<br/>doesn't audition.
He gives you the job or nothing.
So I got the job?!
He cursed me out and hung up.
But then Channel 12 called.<br/>They also loved you.
They offered you a job hosting<br/>their new morning talk show.
- Barney, that's amazing!<br/>- I told them to shove it.
Which only made them want you more.
So, they jacked up their offer<br/>by ten percent.
Congratulations, Miss Scherbatsky.
It looks like you're gonna have<br/>to stay.
- You're not about to dance, are you?<br/>- No, I'm good.
I'll do it later.
How did you pull this off?
I am the master of the possimpible.
You really are.
Thank you.
So, thanks to your Uncle Barney,<br/>we got to keep your Aunt Robin.
And the rest </div>]

[<div class="full-script">Barney check it:
Three blonde babies drinking<br/>bad decision juice at 8:00.
Nice rack radar.
- That's my wife.<br/>- No, I got to get going.
Seriously?<br/>But they're blonde and drunk.
Isn't that your type?
Maybe I don't have a type, Lily.
God, do you think<br/>the male mind is really
that simplistic,
that we all have one favorite type?
Geez.
Asian with some boob.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,<br/>then bail.
Okay, have you guys noticed<br/>Barney's been acting weird lately?
Actually, yes.
You know how he always says<br/>never buy a girl flowers,
'cause giving her a living thing<br/>reminds her babies?
- Sure.<br/>- Well, the other day,
I saw him at that flower shop<br/>on 82nd buying roses.
- What?<br/>- Now that you mention it,
Barney did do something kind of odd<br/>at the office yesterday.
Okay, see you Saturday.
I'm thinking brunch,<br/>farmer's market, maybe a hike.
I love you, too.
Bye.
I figured he was just talking<br/>to some girl he was trying to nail.
Or Ted, but now I don't know.
Wait, do you think it's possible<br/>that Barney Stinson
has a girlfriend?
Later.
Wait, Barney, hold on.<br/>Where are you going?
Nowhere.
The beach.<br/>It's winter. Lazer Tag.
Home. Shut up.<br/>You're going somewhere.
Oh, my God.
He's meeting her right now.
- Where is Barney going?<br/>- Yeah.
We're not even in Manhattan anymore.
Where's this girl live?
We're talking about a woman<br/>who's gotten Barney Stinson to commit.
I'm guessing Narnia.
He's stopping.
- What are you guys doing here?<br/>- Where is she?
- Who?<br/>- Your girlfriend.
You really don't have a type,<br/>do you?
These are my friends.
Guys,
this is Loretta.
- My mom.<br/>- It's so nice to meet you.
I feel like I already know you all.
Barney goes on and on about you<br/>every day when we talk.
You call your mom every day?
Mom!
So that's what you were being<br/>all secretive about?
You didn't want us to know<br/>you're a big old mama's boy.
Yep, you got me.<br/>Well, guess you guys can leave.
Who are all these people?
I'd like you to meet Betty...
my wife.
And my son Tyler.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow
Betty and I are gonna get dinner ready.<br/>There'll be plenty for everyone.
But remember you,
only one helping of meatloaf<br/>after what Dr. Grossbard
- said about your cholesterol.<br/>- This one wants me to live forever.
Guilty.
- I love you.<br/>- I love you, too.
- I love you three!<br/>- Get out of here, you little scamp!
- So, I'll see you guys back at the bar?<br/>- What the hell, Barney?
OK, it's a long story.
As you know, my father<br/>had to leave my mom
when I was a baby because he got hired<br/>as the host of The Price is Right.
- It was a very good show.<br/>- Bob Barker is your father.
She had to raise<br/>my brother and me by herself.
And her only wish was for her sons
not to wind up alone, like she was.
Then about seven years ago,<br/>she got really sick.
It looked like<br/>she wasn't going to make it.
So, I decided to make<br/>her wish come true.
Mom.
This is Betty.<br/>We're engaged.
I hired an actress<br/>to play my fianc?e "Betty".
Her real name's Margaret.
She mostly does off-Broadway theater.<br/>Wonderful actress.
This close to a Tony.<br/>It's all who you know.
It's very political.<br/>I shouldn't get into it.
But there's one problem.
Betty has a slight tendency<br/>to go off-book.
You see, Mom?<br/>I found someone who makes me happy.
Just like you wanted.
That's wonderful.
I just wish I could've stuck around<br/>long enough for grandchildren.
I'm pregnant!
And then my mom got better.
Which was miraculous. But it meant<br/>that I had to keep "Betty"
around and cast a kid<br/>to play my son Tyler.
This is crazy.<br/>You actually cast your own son?
For a while,
I got by borrowing/babysitting<br/>my neighbor's baby.
And this one Christmas,<br/>when my mom was plowed on eggnog,
I got away with a bag of flour<br/>and a Chuckie mask.
But eventually,<br/>I had to hold auditions.
Four,
eight...
13, you can stay.<br/>The rest of you may go.
You said that if I slept with you,<br/>my son would get the part.
Apparently,<br/>I'm a better actor than your kid.
Bring in the 11:00's!
And that's how the role of Tyler<br/>eventually went to...
Grant.
- Come on, Grant seems pretty good.<br/>- You think so?
Watch this.<br/>Hey, Tyler.
- Grant.<br/>- Yeah?
See?<br/>It's like amateur hour over here.
Call me crazy, but child actors<br/>were way better back in the'80s.
It looks like your mom kept
your childhood bedroom<br/>just the way you left it.
That sure is a big poster<br/>of The Karate Kid above your bed.
Karate Kid's a great movie.
It's the story of a hopeful young karate<br/>enthusiast whose dreams and moxie
take him all the way<br/>to the All Valley Karate Championship.
Of course, sadly, he loses<br/>in the final round to that nerd kid.
But he learns an important lesson<br/>about gracefully accepting defeat.
Wait.<br/>When you watch The Karate Kid,
you actually root<br/>for that mean blond boy?
No, I root for the scrawny loser<br/>from New Jersey
who barely even knows karate.
When I watch The Karate Kid,<br/>I root for the karate kid:
Johnny Lawrence<br/>from the Cobra Kai dojo.
Get your head out of your ass, Lily.
Okay, I just figured out<br/>where I know you from.
I saw you perform<br/>at the Disorientation Theater
in Bertolt Brecht's Die Heilige<br/>Johanna der Schlachth felast fall.
You were a revelation!
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure. I mean, the point<br/>of Brecht's work, of course, is to...
Alienate the audience.<br/>Sure.
Sorry.<br/>Brecht-o-phile right here!
You really know your theater.
Lady Theater grabbed my heart early on<br/>and she never let go.
Every year at Christmas,
I'd put on a little play for the parents<br/>with all the other kids.
Gee whiz, Santa, do you think<br/>we can take off in this kind of snow?
Cut! Cut!
Cut! Ricky!
Grandma and Grandpa<br/>are gonna be here in half an hour,
and you're still butchering<br/>my words.
Looks like I'm gonna have to write,<br/>direct and star in this thing.
Give me your elf hat.<br/>Go sit.
I always secretly wanted<br/>to be an actor.
It's one of those life dreams<br/>that just slipped away, I guess.
Listen, if you want,<br/>I could give you some tips on acting.
- Really?<br/>- I'd love to.
Acting rule number one...
At least someone's still excited<br/>about acting.
I miss that.
So, you don't like playing<br/>Barney's son?
I hate it.<br/>But what can I do?
- The phone just ain't ringing.<br/>- I know what you mean.
I'm a newscaster.
But I just had to take a job<br/>hosting a local morning show
that airs at 4:30 in the morning.
I just thought I'd be so much<br/>further along by this point, you know?
I'm almost 30.
Come on, you still look great.
I love your nose job.
I never had a nose job.
Right.
Me neither.
I can't believe<br/>we haven't met you before.
Who knew Barney<br/>had such a great mom?
Thanks, dear.
Truth is, I wasn't always<br/>the best mother when I was younger.
Don't say that.<br/>I'm sure you were great.
Yeah, I was a bit of a whore.
Excuse me?
A whore, dear.<br/>A dirty whore.
I'm not proud of it.
But...
still, I had some fun.
There is no thrill equal to...
looking into some guy's eyes<br/>and thinking,
"I don't know your name,<br/>you don't know mine, but...
"for the next eight minutes,
"we are gonna rock<br/>this gas station bathroom
"right off its foundation."
And then just drive off<br/>in opposite directions.
Just keep driving.
Barney's mom?
Loretta.
Anyway, that's,<br/>that's all in the past now.
I did the best I could, but...
sometimes I wonder how Barney<br/>turned out to be so perfect.
You have to tell your mom<br/>the truth, okay?
Listen, she is a sweet,
caring, slightly too graphic woman<br/>who deserves better.
No way. The truth would kill her.
I don't feel right
about lying to such<br/>a kindhearted woman, okay?
She reminds me of my own mother.
- What?<br/>- Kindhearted?
Remember in our wedding vows<br/>when I said we'd be together forever?
On our way back up the aisle,<br/>your mother leaned in and she said,
"Not forever, sweetie.<br/>Marshall's going to heaven."
- She was making a joke.<br/>- She hates me, Marshall.
But that's okay because...
Never mind.
What were you gonna say?
Nothing. Do you want to go do it<br/>in Barney's childhood bedroom again?
- On the race car bed?<br/>- Handles great, buddy.
Look, Lily, if today has taught us<br/>nothing else, it's that
honesty is important<br/>when it comes to family.
Now, whatever you're feeling<br/>towards my mother,
we've been together<br/>for 12 years, baby.
- I think that I can handle it.<br/>- Really?
I hate your mom.
Guess what?
I hate you!
Two minute warning for meatloaf!
Meatloaf?
Tyler no likey!
We have been over this<br/>a million times!
- You are not getting a catchphrase!<br/>- But it's funny.
I am not afraid to recast.
Now go memorize your lines<br/>for the big dinner scene.
Wait. So you wrote the dinner<br/>we're about to have?
Just a short script.
Just things that will make<br/>my mom happy to hear.
What kind of things?
And I really thought
Barney had forgotten<br/>our anniversary.
So I storm out to the backyard,<br/>and there's smoke coming out of my ears.
Nostrils flaring. Her nostrils flare<br/>when she gets mad. I love it.
Doing it right now.<br/>Doing it right now!
You better stop, mister!
Sorry, sorry, boo bear. Continue.
This is what you're actually<br/>like in a relationship.
So I storm out<br/>to the backyard and...
candles everywhere...
and a string quartet.
- Can you believe that?<br/>- No, not even slightly.
What about my little Ty-Ty.<br/>What have you been up to?
Funny story:
just the other night,<br/>this little rascal had a nightmare.
When he came in<br/>to tell us what it was about,
do you remember<br/>what you said, champ?
Page four.
The dinosaur bones in the museum<br/>came to life and started chasing me?
Thanks a lot, buddy.<br/>I didn't need to sleep tonight.
Tyler said, "My nightmare was
"that you and Mommy didn't<br/>know how much I loved you.
"So I wanted to come in<br/>and tell you it was this much."
That's so sweet.
We're a sweet happy family.
'm gonna grab some ice cream<br/>from the freezer downstairs
and then we'll all hit<br/>the sundae bar in the kitchen.
Not a weak link in that scene.
Bravo.
Back off, Barney.<br/>You have no idea how hard it is
to do a job that's beneath you.
I really enjoyed your thing<br/>about the dinosaur bones.
Can we please stop talking<br/>about the dinosaur bones?
Just go eat your sundae.
I can't.<br/>I'm lactose-intolerant.
Guess who's not<br/>lactose-intolerant? Tyler.
Tyler is gonna go in there
and enjoy every last bite.
Ice cream time, gang.
Yummers!
My God!
Tyler no likey.
You're not getting a catchphrase.
I don't understand.
I do.
Follow my lead.
I've...
been betrayed
by my best friend.
How could you do this, Ted?
Think about poor Tyler
bravely trying to hold back tears.
It's okay, son, you can cry.
Cry!
I don't want my mommy<br/>and daddy to get divorced!
What could you possibly have<br/>to say for yourself?
Acting rule number one:
"Don't be afraid to improvise."
Was it me who betrayed you,
or you who betrayed me?
I'm sorry. What?
Acting rule number five:
"Invent a rich back story<br/>for your character."
November 14th, 1998.
The overnight train to Monte Carlo.
I was in the billiards car
hustling some Algerians<br/>out of few thousand dinar,
when you seduced my fianc?e!
Who is blind and thought<br/>you were me.
What in God's name<br/>are you talking about?
Acting rule number eight:
Don't be afraid to get physical.
You know damn well<br/>what I'm talking about!
No, I don't!
Yes, you do! And by God,
I'll hear you say it, scoundrel!
Mom, can you give us a sec?
There's chocolate and butterscotch.
There's various kinds<br/>of sprinkles and marshmallows.
Have you lost your mind?!
You were amazing!
You completely just became<br/>that character.
Honestly,<br/>I wasn't so much playing Ted
as I was just trying<br/>to get out of Ted's way.
What is wrong with you people?
How am I ever gonna<br/>explain this to my mother?
Maybe it's time<br/>to tell her the truth.
I don't know, Lily.<br/>Sometimes, honesty leads people
to say mean things about a woman<br/>who always took special care of me
because I was the<br/>runt of the family.
For crying out loud,<br/>I'm only six-four!
How good was my crying?
You nailed it.<br/>See?
Even at a gig you hate,<br/>you still managed to love what you do.
Maybe that's how it will be<br/>for you at your new job.
- You think so?<br/>- I know so.
Thanks, Grant.
You're pretty smart, you know that?
Sorry! Sorry!
Thought I was picking up<br/>on something.
Honey, are you okay?
Look, Mom,<br/>there's something I have to tell you.
Something I should have<br/>told you a long time ago.
Tyler is dying.
And Betty said that when he goes,
she's gonna off herself.
So that's probably<br/>all gonna go down pretty soon.
Oh, my God!
None of that is true!
The truth is, I...
The truth is Betty and Tyler<br/>are actors
that I hired<br/>to pretend to be my family.
What?
I just wanted you to think<br/>I had the life
you wanted for me.<br/>I wanted you to be proud of me.
I know it sounds crazy,<br/>and I am so sorry, Mom.
So Betty is not your wife?
Thank God!
I do not like that woman.
- Really?<br/>- Yes.
And Tyler...
I know I'm his grandma<br/>and I'm supposed to love him,
but I hate that kid.
"Tyler no likey!"
- What the hell is that?<br/>- Right?
Those fake friends of yours out there,<br/>I just wanted to shoot myself.
I know!<br/>Aren't they horrible?
So really, really, you're not mad?
I'm just confused. I don't know<br/>why you thought you had to do this.
Barney, I love you, perfect<br/>family or no perfect family.
I love you no matter what.
- Really?<br/>- Really.
I am so relieved
because the truth is<br/>I am as far from married
as a human being can possibly be.
My history with women<br/>would shock and appall you.
Doesn't matter.<br/>I still love you.
Seriously, you can't imagine<br/>the things I have done.
Barney, when you were three,<br/>I left you with a babysitter
and spent three weeks<br/>with Grand Funk Railroad
being passed around like a bong.
Mommy!
Just do me a favor.
If you ever do meet someone special,
don't run away from it.<br/>Don't be me.
Take a shot at it, will you?
Cab's here.
I'll try.
And so ended one of the strangest<br/>afternoons of our lives.
And I just wanted to say to you,
if I ever seemed cold
or unwelcoming, I'm sorry.
Who's she talking to?
My mom.
It would mean a lot to me<br/>if you and I could be closer.
Now take a deep breath like this next<br/>thing is gonna be hard to say.
I love you.
I love you...
Mom.
... Mom.
Now pretend I said something nice.
Now pretend I said something nice.
I mean,
that's very nice<br/>of you to say, Judy.
You, too.<br/>Speak soon.
Let me get this straight.<br/>You're really telling me
that when you watch The Karate Kid,
you don't root for Daniel-san?
- Who do you root for in Die Hard?<br/>- Hans Gruber,
charming international bandit.
At the end, he died hard.
He's the title character.
Okay, The Breakfast Club?
The teacher running detention.
He's the only guy<br/>in the whole movie wearing a suit.
I got one.<br/>Terminator.
What's the name of the movie, Robin?
Who among us didn't shed a tear
when his little red eye<br/>went out at the end
and he didn't get<br/>to kill those people?
I'm sorry.<br/>That movie...
I am never watching a movie<br/>with you ever again.
They didn't even try to help him!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Back in 2009, your Aunt Robin got<br/>a job hosting a morning show
Which meant she had<br/>to get up kind of early.
How early?
'Morning everybody.
So you actually doing it?
You're actually going to work<br/>at 2:00 a.m.?
I'm not doing it for me,<br/>I'm doing it for the fans.
Who exactly are the fans of a show<br/>that airs at 4:00 in the morning?
People getting up to host a show<br/>at 5:00 in the morning.
Meth addicts who haven't sold<br/>their TVs yet?
Strippers in that<br/>messy gray area between
getting off work and<br/>getting their kids up for school?
Them's my peeps.
All right, catch me up.<br/>What's been going on?
You know...
The yoozh.
Really, the yoozh?
Think of the funniest thing<br/>that has ever happened.
- Got it.<br/>- Now double that.
So, a chimpanzee wearing<br/>two texudos.
Something even funnier than that<br/>happen's to Marshall today.
Okay, first of all,<br/>there's nothing funnier than that.
Second of all, look it's...
It's not that good a story.
Come on, you guys,
you're four young active people living<br/>in the most exciting city on earth.
You're telling me you have<br/>no stories for me?
What can I say?<br/>Some weeks are just like that.
It's the same thing over and over.
A kid in my class ate some paste.
I used deceitful means to hook up<br/>with a less-than-intelligent girl.
My ex-gilfriend Karen moved to town,<br/>it's just all the same Robin.
Karen's in town?
- Oh noooo!<br/>- You have got to be kidding me!
Kids, I think I've<br/>told you about Karen.
She was my girlfriend in high-school,<br/>and intermittently through college.
She was beautiful, smart.
I was madly in love with her.
The only problem was,
Marshall and Lily were not.
I think it had something to do<br/>were every time Karen opened her mouth.
I love taht you guys live in a dorm.
It's so American.
It's like let's all eat baloney<br/>sandiwches and be racist.
Oh my God. She was such a douche.
Dude, she was the heiress<br/>of the Massengill fortune.
She really wasn't that bad.
Of course, you think that<br/>she turned you into one of
her douche zombies.
I want to eat your brain
but only if it's organic<br/>and grass-fed.
What?
Will you pass the salt?
Salt?
So bourgeois.
Totally.
What's that thing?
That's... a TV, Karen.
I don't watch TV.
Totally.
You thought I actually bought<br/>tickets to Wrestle Mania?
I was being ironic.
Totally.
I know...
that you were being ironic.
I too...
I'm being ironic.
Let's do this.
What?
That make up didn't<br/>come off for a month.
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.<br/>I've never looked like a bigger jackass.
Until today, tell the story...
Just let it go.
Well, hold on.<br/>Is it really funny?
I am not kidding you.
I almost don't want you to hear it,<br/>because seriously...
for the rest of your life,
nothing else will ever be as funny<br/>and you
will curse yourself for agreeing<br/>to ever hear it in the first place.
But seriously, you got to hear it,<br/>it's so funny.
Fine.
I was at the compagny gym this<br/>morning, playing basketball, and
the guys I work with can be<br/>pretty brutal with their ridicule.
Look at Wisniewski.
He's gonna cry, look at him.
I don't know. I don't think knees aren't<br/>supposed to bend that way, I think...
he might have tore his ACL.
The only thing that guy tore was<br/>his cervix or maybe his hymen.
Yeah, or his fallopian tube.
I may have cleaned up<br/>the dialogue a little bit.
Anyways...
I go to my duffle bag<br/>to get out my work clothes.
Wait, wait!
I want to say it...
Fine, you say it.
Marshall goes to his duffle bag<br/>to get out his work clothes
and... No, no, no, you say it.<br/>It's funnier if you say it.
No, let me say it!
No, you say it.<br/>You say it. Say it.
Same time!
No, no, no.<br/>You go, you go!
- I forgot...<br/>- Marshall forgot his pants!
He forgot his pants.
Sync by vNaru
Marshhal forget his pants,<br/>That's pretty funny.
It's not a chimpanzee<br/>wearing two tuxedos.
What? Did he...<br/>forgot he put the first one on?
Stupid monkey!
So Karen in New York,<br/>weird, right?
Ted, you cannot get back together<br/>with Karen.
I nerver said I was going to get back<br/>together with her.
I was thinking
she's new in town, would it be the worst<br/>thing in the world if I gave her a call?
It wouldn't be the worst thing<br/>in the world,
it would be the fourth worst thing.
Number 1, Super volcano.<br/>Number 2, an astroid hits the Earth.
Number 3,<br/>all footage of Evel Knievel is lost.
Number 4, Ted calls Karen.
Number 5,<br/>Lily gets eaten by a shark.
I'm Lily and I approve<br/>the order of that list.
You don't know the whole story.
Ted and Karen were off and on<br/>all through college,
and it always went the same way.
They'd be having fun,<br/>douching it up, and then one day...
I know you think pepperoni is fascist<br/>and you're totally right, so I can...
Oh, my God! Karen!
Sorry, bro.
Before you say anything,
I think that you should read
Baudelaire's, "Les Fleurs Du Mal".
So then they break up,<br/>He would be all depressed, and
we would wait<br/>the appropriate amount of time
and then we'd would tell him<br/>how we really felt.
- Karen and I broke up.<br/>- We hated her!
Bitch had to go!
And then Ted would build up<br/>a head of steam
and finally take the bus to Providence<br/>to give Karen a piece of his mind.
How did it go?
Great.
Look who's back?
And then sure enough, the whole<br/>thing would start all over again.
Make that 10 000 and 2 Maniacs, because<br/>I got us Natalie Merchant tick...
Sorry, bro.
So she would come visit you at school<br/>and the second you turned your back
she would bring guys<br/>back to your dorm room?
Respect.
I was an idiot.
She was my first real girlfriend,<br/>She was madly in love with her.
We all did stuff we regret,<br/>in college.
Junior year,<br/>Marshall grew a soul patch,
wore a rasta hat, and asked<br/>everyone to call him M.J. Smooth.
I don't regret that for one second.
So you guys, absolutely<br/>don't think I should call her?
- Ted, no!<br/>- What's wrong with you?
Fine I won't.
Interristing piece of trivia,
- I called her.<br/>- What are you doing?
It's the pants story.
I can't believe you called her.
Why don't you just ask her<br/>to lunch while you're at it?
Because, Lily, I'm not gonna<br/>ask her out to lunch...
again.
You asked her to lunch?
Why would anyone,<br/>want to have a lunch,
- with their ex.<br/>- Glad you asked, Marshall.
There are four possible motives<br/>behind an ex lunch.
Number 1, they want to<br/>get back together.
Like my high school<br/>boyfriend Scooter.
Lilies, clever.
I'm sorry I don't have<br/>a scooter for you.
My God, that's funny.
I forgot how funny you are.
- Where is the waiter?<br/>- Why?
You like waiters?
I can be a waiter.
I'm going to be the greatest waiter<br/>on this earth, and then you'll love me.
Number 2, they want to kill you.
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.
I'm glad we could finally do this.
You know, after that ninth time<br/>you rescheduled on me?
I almost gave up on you.
But you didn't.
You just kept on trying.
By the way...
there's something<br/>I've been meaning to give you.
Gun! She's got a gun!
It's a tie.
Number 3, they actually do<br/>want to give you your stuff back.
Like when I had lunch with Curt.
By the way, there's something<br/>I've been meaning to give you?
My snub-nosed. 38 police special.
I knew I left that somewhere.
Every time I watch the news, I'm like,<br/>"Hope that wasn't my gun."
Breaking up was the right choice.
Or number 4, to rub your face<br/>in how great they're doing.
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?<br/>- My ex.
Hello Nicole.
You look well, Marshall.
You look okay, I guess.
- I'm seing someone.<br/>- Already?
Who?
Lee Roberts.<br/>He reads at a fifth grade level.
You have to cancel the lunch.
I would definitetly do that,<br/>definitetly.
Except I already had it.
I'm going to need to borrow<br/>the butt of your gun.
I actually lost it again.<br/>Can you believe that?
How could you break bread<br/>with that woman?
It was just lunch.<br/>And you know she doesn't eat wheat.
We had great time, catching up.
We even laughed about<br/>what jerks we were back then.
I can't believe I had a beret<br/>for each day of the week.
I can't believe I had an iron-on<br/>image of Moli?re on my backpack.
Man, we were pretentious.
So pretentious.
What can I get you?
I don't want to cause a scene
but your wine list has<br/>a Ch?teauneuf du Pape
listed under the C?te de Provence.
You might want to alert your sommelier
And, for you?
I hate to go off-menu but,<br/>can you bring us some
brochette with<br/>fresh mozzarella? Grazie.
It was great.<br/>It was great.
There was one, weird moment,<br/>towards the end.
How do you say good-bye<br/>in those situations?
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar,<br/>a handshake is too formal...
A hug is just like<br/>a public dry hump.
I think you're hugging wrong.
- So what happenned?<br/>- Well...
Schopenhauer made<br/>a saucy little argument,
in which, he pos...
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside and<br/>bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.
Karen, was the first girl<br/>I ever loved.
Okay? And, after the year I've had,
I don't know, I guess,<br/>having lunch with her just...
remind me of what it was like to be 18<br/>and have my whole life figured out.
And I would like to remind everyone,
that at least,<br/>I was wearing pants, Marshall!
You can't just go changing<br/>the subject like that!
The pants story.
Pants story bomaye!<br/>Pants story bomaye!
There is no story!<br/>I had a little situation
- so I called Lily.<br/>- Refresh us,
- what was that situation?<br/>- I forgot my pants.
What do you mean,<br/>you forgot your pants?
I forgot them.
I need you to bring me some.
What about your spare pants?
Last thursday, the mustard incident?
Jeez, woman, you have<br/>the memory of a goldfish!
You're not getting off that easy!
Marshall's pants story,<br/>while amusing...
Amusing?<br/>Try... Very amusing.
Is nothing compared to this<br/>Karen madness. Finish your story.
Taht's it! It was just<br/>one kiss in the restaurant.
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?
Did you kiss somewhere else?
Like where?
In a tree?
Lily, we did not make out in a tree!
What's with this one?
What did you do?
Ted, how could you?
Marshall forgot to bring<br/>his pants to work today
and you're still the stupidest person<br/>at this table.
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.
We both know<br/>your real motivation here,
you hate Karen,
because, she lingered.
You son of a bitch!
What do you mean, she lingered?
February 5, 1998.
I was painting.
Sorry, I...
Sorry... I...
You know...
Thaht color palette is a bit<br/>derivative of early Van Gogh,
don't you think?
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,<br/>whatever that's your business.
But I catch you,
peeping on my man's junk,<br/>and you linger!
You gots to get got!
The game is the game.
In Karen's defense,<br/>I had just worked out.
Why did you have to paint<br/>Marshall nude anyway?
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.
But the point is, Karen,
is a dirty linger
and you cannot bring<br/>her back into our lives!
Relax! It was just that one night!
And the next three after that.<br/>And one morning.
But at least,<br/>I had pants on, Marshall.
Although, actually, I didn't.
Wait. This happen in our appartment?
Where was I?
You know, those sleeping pills you're
taking to keep on<br/>your crazy new schedule?
I think they're stronger<br/>than you realize.
La Fontaine gets<br/>the puck to Turgeon.
Turgeon shoots.
Glove save!
Hey, Ted.<br/>Hey, Lily.
Don't worry, I won't tell Marshall.
I'm gonna grab a beer, you want one?
Beer!
I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.
Sure it's fun to look back at a time
when you were a fresh-faced<br/>farm girl with a virgin's glow.
But all that stuff,<br/>Ohio, Karen, college?
All that was B.S.
Before Stinson.
Now, your life is awesome!<br/>I mean, yeah,
you still live with your ex-girlfriend<br/>which is ridiculous.
Your Laser Tag chops<br/>are almost nonexistent.
And your wardrobe!
It's like...
what, are you allergic to quality<br/>fabrics? Seriously Ted, shape up!
What were we talking about?
So what's next with this broad?
Please, the story is already written.
Ted is Charlie Brown,<br/>trying to kick the football
and Karen's Lucy, who pulls it away at<br/>the last second and has sex with it.
You guys know what I mean.
Ted's gonna fall in love and then<br/>Karen's gonna cheat on him
with some meathead who's like
Sorry, bro.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
You must have left the right answer<br/>in your pants Marshall,
cause that's exactly<br/>what didn't happen.
You guys, here' what happenned.
One afternoon,<br/>we were at Karen's place...
Oh, my God!
How could you?
Sorry, bro.
So this time, the meathead<br/>Karen was cheating with...
Was me.
Me.
Remember that time<br/>Marshall forgot his pants?
You quit trying to change the subject.<br/>You crossed the line.
You are complicit in breaking<br/>some poor guy's heart. And you,
you of all people know<br/>exactly how that feels.
You really don't want to tell<br/>the pants story?
- What?<br/>- Pants, pants...
Fine!
Lily came down to the office<br/>to bring me my pants...
- Why did she have to do that?<br/>- Because I forgot my pants.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to give Marshall something.
Here to give him something.<br/>Gotcha. Nice.
But I'm in a hurry.<br/>Can I just give it to you?
Sure.
And then you'll give it to him?
Wait. I don't know about all that.
I mean,<br/>yours would have to be really good.
- What are you talking about?<br/>- What are you talking about?
Marshall forgot his pants,<br/>so I'm bringing him a new pair.
Marshall forgot his pants.
It's a good thing that you came by<br/>because he has a really
important meeting today,<br/>and it would be pretty embarrassing
and not at all funny if he were<br/>to show up not wearing pants.
- I'll make sure he gets these.<br/>- Great. Thanks.
And you didn't give him his pants.
Of course I gave him his pants.<br/>I gave Lily my word. My word is oak.
Though I did make some alterations.
Now, as you'll see on page 44<br/>of the contract...
When did you join AC/DC?
Now, can we please just turn<br/>to page 44 of the contract.
I think the Oliver Twist auditions<br/>are down the hall!
Please, sir, may I have some more...<br/>pants?
More pan...
That's it? That's the whole story?
- So what happened with Karen?<br/>- I'll finish it for you.
Ted left without saying anything and<br/>Karen got exactly what she wanted.
Not this time.
You have a boyfriend?
We've been drifting<br/>apart for a long time.
I've been meaning to<br/>break up with him.
You are unbelievable.
You don't have the guts
to break up with someone<br/>like a decent human being,
so instead you pull this crap.
You're right.
I'm great with books.
I'm great with art.
I'm great with<br/>identifying French wines
from within a mile of where<br/>the grapes are grown. But...
I'm really bad when it comes<br/>to looking someone in the eye
and telling them the truth<br/>about how I feel.
We're both bad at that. But...
I think we both need to change. So,<br/>why don't I go first?
You're a really hurtful<br/>and reckless person, and
I never want to see you<br/>or speak to you again.
Au revoir.
Wait.
Actually,
"au revoir"means "until<br/>we see each other again".
So, I'm assuming that you mean
we will in fact
see each other again?
Sorry, bro.
I am impressed with you.
You, too, Marshall.<br/>Have you been wearing those all day?
They show off my calves.
Pants story. Tell it again.
Maybe it was good you called Karen.
It definitely was.<br/>And not just for me, but for her, too.
Later that night,<br/>she sat down with Jerry,
and she had the break-up talk<br/>she always avoided with me.
So you see, kids,
sometimes when you have<br/>to have a tough conversation,
the best thing to do...
Wait...
a second.
You said you were never gonna talk<br/>to Karen again, right?
Then how do you know<br/>she took your advice?
Well, about that...
After she broke up with that dude, she<br/>called me, we went out, we hooked up,
we've been dating ever since.<br/>We're really seeing eye to eye,
it just feels different somehow.<br/>Here she comes now. Be cool!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In March of 2009, I'd been dating my high school<br/>girlfriend Karen for a few weeks.
My friends couldn't have<br/>been happier about it.
- Hey, everybody.<br/>- Hello.
Sorry, we, uh, we can't stay long.
- What a shame!<br/>- That is sad!
Hey, are those real diamond earrings?
Yes. Yes, they are. Thank you.
I didn't say I liked them.
Oh, well, I got a great deal on them, so...
Cool. I'm sure all the exploited diamond miners<br/>in Sierra Leone would give you a high-five
if they still had all their<br/>fingers. But really pretty.
Meet me upstairs.
They only need one finger to<br/>give her what I'm thinking.
Yeah. Ted, Karen's a douche.
Thanks for sugarcoating it.
"Douche"is sugarcoating it.
Uh, okay, believe it or not, my friends<br/>do not get a vote on who I date.
It's my life. I call the shots.
- Ted, now!<br/>- Yeah, coming!
I don't know what Ted sees<br/>in that horrible woman.
I mean, yeah, she's got boobs, but...
well, I guess I get it.
I think it's 'cause<br/>they met in high school.
She was his first real girlfriend.
We look at Karen and see a jerk.
Ted looks at Karen and sees the first<br/>person to touch his wiener besides himself,
his mom, and his pediatrician.
Okay, well, it's almost 2:00 A.M.<br/>I better get ready for work.
How can they call that thing<br/>you're on a "morning show"?
4:00 A.M.is still the<br/>middle of the night.
I don't see how you do it.
It's been almost a<br/>month. I'm used to it.
Plus the show's not half bad, right?
- Totally.<br/>- I've never seen it.
Have you guys ever watched it?
- Of course!<br/>- I've never seen it.
Really? What is your favorite segment?
- Weather.<br/>- I've never seen it.
- You guys have never seen my show.<br/>- Sorry.
- It's true.<br/>- That's what I've been saying.
Okay, yes, it's dull and generic and we get<br/>spanked in the ratings by that Korean channel
I'll tell you what.
This Friday morning, everyone<br/>can come to our place 3:30 A.M.
We'll all put on PJs.<br/>We'll watch Robin's show.
Aw, you guys are the best.
We just want to support you.
I just want to go to sleep!
I hate Robin for not<br/>being more successful.
Hey, guys.
Sad announcement:<br/>Karen broke up with me.
Go ahead.
I knew you were listening! Yes!
Sync by vNaru
Hey, hey, we shouldn't be celebrating.
Ted's just been through a bad breakup.
Look, buddy, tell us everything.<br/>Tell us what happened.
Seriously, spare no details.
What did she say? What did<br/>you say? How did it feel?
If you were to do it again,<br/>all over, would you maybe...
How did it happen?
It was the stupidest thing.
I mean, we were just hanging<br/>out, you know, being funny...
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.
Ew, no, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.
Wait. What is this?
Looks like one of Robin's<br/>earrings. That's weird.
- You're the fan...<br/>- How did it get in your bed?
I don't know.
Have you been sleeping with Robin?
What? No, of course not!
It, it probably got mixed in<br/>with the laundry or something.
Why should I believe you?
Um, maybe because I've<br/>alwaysbeen faithful to you
while you've cheated on<br/>me, like, six times, bitch.
- Oh, snap! -<br/>Cold-blooded!
Right? Right?
I totally should have said that.
Why should I believe you?
Um, maybe because I'vealwaysbeen<br/>faithful to you while you...
I love you...
I knew this was a mistake.<br/>That's it. It's over.
And that was it. She left.
What a story.
So brave of you to share that.
Wait. Thoseare your pajamas?
You sleep in a pajama suit?
Of course. What do you think I sleep in?
A coffin.
Dude, that doesn't look<br/>comfortable at all.
You're wearing a tie.
First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.
Second, it's not about comfort.
It's about looking good all the time.
Why do you have to<br/>look good all the time?
Marshall, let me tell you a little story about<br/>something that happened a couple months back.
We were just having a "Who's hornier" contest<br/>and we spilled massage oil all over ourselves.
Nice pajamas.
Can we use your shower?
That's not a memory.<br/>That's from a porn movie.
Not just any movie. That's<br/>the exact scene from...
Never mind.
The point is itcouldhappen.
And if it did, and I didn't look my absolute best<br/>for those greasy sluts, I'd regret it forever.
I'm sorry, dude, but that is just the most<br/>ridiculous sleeping attire I've ever seen in my life.
Anyway...
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!<br/>Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Hey, guys, you know how in the future we're always<br/>saying "Remember when Marshall wore a nightgown"?
This is that time!
It's a nightshirt.
You can call it a Ninja<br/>Star Danger Jock if you want.
Doesn't make you any<br/>less of a cross-dresser.
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.
So, flying to Neverland with<br/>Peter and Tink, was that amazing?
Ooh, let me go next!
Was it nice to finally get out of that crowded<br/>bed and take Charlie to the chocolate factory?
Ooh, me, me, me, me!
Um, something about Scrooge!
Come on, guys. I'm carrying the team.
I don't know. I lived<br/>with Marshall for 12 years.
Any time he's wearing<br/>clothes at all, it's a victory.
Ted, show's about to start!
Be right there!
Good morning, New York. I'm Robin...
Marshall, I just found Robin's<br/>earring on your dresser.
Did you have something to do with<br/>the other one being in my bed?
What are you talking about?
You've always hated Karen. You've<br/>been telling me to break up with her.
You did it. You-you put the earring<br/>in my bed so that Karen would find it.
No, Ted, No! I would never...
- Admit it!<br/>- There's nothing to admit!
Then why was Robin's<br/>earring on your dresser?
He was accessorizing!
Marshall, I swear to God, if you<br/>don't tell me the truth right now...
Wait! Marshall didn't do it.
I did.
I broke you and Karen up.
You broke me and Karen<br/>up? Are you insane?
What gives you the right to do that?
Ted, I did it for your own good.
You just weren't seeing<br/>how awful she was.
She failed the Front Porch Test.
What's the Front Porch Test?
Ted, you, me, and Marshall have<br/>been best friends since college.
Think about how much we<br/>all mean to each other.
So when I picture the future,<br/>I picture us all together.
How we'll all be retired, sipping tea<br/>on the front porch of our beach house,
playing bridge all day.
Okay, bridges are wild.
Four of a bridge beats a royal bridge.
I see your bridge and I<br/>raise you three bridges.
Bridge! I win!
You have no idea how<br/>to play bridge, do you?
We're gonna take a class.
It's important to stay active.
So whenever you've been dating somebody<br/>for a while, I do the Front Porch Test.
You know, how is this person gonna<br/>fit in with our group over the years?
And when I think about Karen there...
Bridge! I win!
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.
Don't read a book or anything.
Look, dear... dolphins.
They seem happy.
I guess the chemical runoff from this elitist beachfront<br/>property hasn't rotted out their blowholes yet.
It will. That water will kill you.
It is a toxic deathtrap.
I'm gonna take a dip.
I'll join you.
Karen failed the Front<br/>Porch Test. She had to go.
I can't believe you did that.
Ted, think about how awesome<br/>you, me, and Marshall are.
Seriously think about it.
- We're pretty awesome.<br/>- We're totally awesome!
So whoever you marry,<br/>whoever joins Team Awesome,
the bar is set pretty damn high.
Look, I'm not saying what<br/>I did was right, but...
You're better off without her.
And if Clarence the angel<br/>says it's true, it must be true.
Okay, you know what?<br/>Fine, make your little jokes.
Seriously, why would you<br/>wear something like that?
- Lots of reasons.<br/>- I bet you can't name five.
One: No need to wear<br/>anything underneath.
I can vouch for that. Will<br/>you cross your legs, buddy?
Two: Sexy.
I can vouch for that.
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?
Three: My Grandpa Olaf wore<br/>one and he lived to be 107.
Four: No elastic waistband leaving its judgmental<br/>pink teeth marks around my Thanksgiving belly.
And five: Every night when I<br/>go to sleep, it's the freest,
most wonderful feeling in the world.
I feel... like I'm flying.
So that's how I go to bed<br/>every night: happy, weightless.
With a heart full of<br/>joy. What about you?
I have to lie perfectly still<br/>so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.
But at least I'm not wearing a dress.
So... how mad are you?
I don't know. I mean,
I guess if you guys feel that strongly<br/>about Karen, then maybe it was for the best.
I really am sorry.
I hated doing that again,<br/>but Karen had to go.
"Again"? Wait. How many times have<br/>you broken me up with a girlfriend?
Never! Six.
- Like who?<br/>- No one! Angie.
Sophomore year.
She was just using you to get back at<br/>her ex, and you clearly didn't see it,
so one day when she was taking a nap...
Creed?
Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.
So that's where my Creed CD went.
Who else?
Remember that weird sci-fi girl who wanted<br/>you to propose after, like, two months?
You barely even liked her, but you<br/>were still thinking about it, so...
Listen, Ted, you're great,<br/>and this is so difficult,
but I think we're looking<br/>for different things.
So, live long and prosper. Or whatever.
That was you? This is insane!
Ted, I did those things to help you.
You're a commitment junkie.
You fall in love with these women,<br/>even if they don't deserve you.
What if one of those women was supposed<br/>to be the mother of my children?
If there was ever the tiniest chance<br/>of that, I swear I didn't do anything.
Like with Victoria or Stella.
Or Robin.
Or Robin.
Robin, Robin.
Did you break us up, too?
Did you break us up, too?
Stop talking to me like I'm your enemy!
You weep for these women, but you have<br/>the luxury of not knowing what I know:
That those breakups, while tragic,<br/>probably saved you from a crappy
and very expensive first marriage.
Did you break me and Robin up?
You don't want the truth because deep down,<br/>you want me out there watching out for you.
And deep down, you know that none of those women<br/>were ever gonna be the mother of your children.
- Did you break me and Robin up?<br/>- I did what I had to do.
- Did you break me and Robin up?<br/>- You're damn right I did!
Marshall, your grandpa<br/>Olaf was a wise man.
You broke me and Robin up?
- No, it's not...<br/>- I cannot believe this.
I need another drink.
You know, I feel a little<br/>breeze down there. It's nice.
Oh, you think that's something?
Stand over this heating vent. It's<br/>like your junk is on a tropical island.
Little Barney says "Mahalo."
Seriously, what is wrong with you, Lily?
How could you do that?
I did this because I care about you!
I am so glad that is<br/>the one you watched!
Dear God, what happened to you?
You didn't watch my show?
The show. Sorry.
Something special happen?
Same old, same old.
Lily just told us that<br/>she broke you and me up.
What? Broke-broke us up?<br/>What does that even mean?
And why are these guys<br/>wearing nightgowns?
- Nightshirts.<br/>- Nightshirts.
- It's a nightshirt.<br/>- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.
Turns out Lily has taken it upon herself to<br/>sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.
No. Robin was different. I<br/>didn't want you two to break up,
but you wanted completely different things<br/>out of life and refused to deal with it.
I could just picture that front porch.
Mm, two of hearts.
Just like the hearts of the two children I<br/>never had because my lovely wife hates kids.
Mm, a deuce.
Exactly what my career dropped once I<br/>decided to settle down and marry Ted.
Bridge! I win.
Well, I do not like<br/>that scenario one bit.
All I tried to do was get you<br/>guys to talk about your issues.
I didn't know I was feeding you the<br/>words that would lead to your breakup.
Hey, here's a fun question, just for fun.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
You know what's fun? Fun questions.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
Where do you see yourself?
Not to put words in your mouth,<br/>but you probably want to be married.
I probably want to be married.
You probably want to<br/>be in Tokyo or Paris.
I probably want to be in Argentina.
Argentina?
Or Tokyo or Paris.
We have an expiration date, don't we?
Oh, my God.
Lily, you can't manipulate<br/>people like that!
I - I've known you 12 years, and I can honestly<br/>say, I have never been more furious at you!
- Look, I didn't mean to...I was just...<br/>- No! I don't even want to hear it!
Settle down! Let's just settle down!
Now, I have one question.
What do these bad boys feel like in bed?
Come on. Let's go see.
So, if it weren't for you, Ted<br/>and I might still be dating?
Or you would have stayed<br/>together far too long,
had an incredibly bitter breakup<br/>and not even remained friends,
and then you and I would<br/>never have become best friends.
Don't even say that. Okay?
Stop hugging!
Lily, you had no right to<br/>interfere in my relationships.
You got lucky. Okay?
You met the love of your life in<br/>a dorm hallway when you were 18.
But that doesn't give<br/>you the right to play God
to the rest of us mortals down here<br/>who are still looking for someone.
You're so concerned about who you and Marshall<br/>are gonna end up on that front porch with.
Well, you know what?
You can have it to yourselves.
What happened to your jacket?
Oh, soot, bread crumbs, placenta.
Did you at least TiVo it?
So you're this comfy every night,<br/>and Lily still has sex with you?
Yeah. That's what marriage is<br/>all about, man, unconditional love.
You can wear whatever you<br/>want and still get laid.
Tell me more about being married.
Well, sometimes, when you're married,
you wake up to the smell of<br/>breakfast already on the table.
- And coffee, too?<br/>- And coffee, too.
Sometimes, she'll even put out<br/>a vase of freshly cut flowers.
I love flowers.
And sometimes, when you're worried you've<br/>made all the wrong decisions in life
and you're not nearly the man you<br/>want to be, what does she do then?
Well, she tells you that you're<br/>great and it's all gonna be okay.
That's wonderful.
And she'll help you find<br/>other girls to have sex with?
I mean, I guess.
Maybe if you agreed upon<br/>that beforehand, yeah.
Little guy had a big day.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Sweet dreams, slugger.
The next night, I was still<br/>angry at your aunt Lily.
Until...
What are you...
Lily came by and explained everything.
And she gave me this note for you.
"Ted, I'm sorry.
"It doesn't matter to me who you marry.
"I know they'll be awesome<br/>because they'll think you are.
"To show I mean it, I put together a little<br/>surprise "for you and Karen upstairs.
Love, Lily."
"P.S.Sorry the envelope<br/>was already open.
"I had to read what<br/>she wrote. Marshall."
Sabotaging our relationship?
I got to say, even using the specially-ordered<br/>extra-low bar by which I judge your friends,
Lily really outdid herself this time.
Obviously, we can't ever see her again.
I know. It's a big loss, right?
Hey, rember your old college roommate?
He was married to that<br/>shrill little idiot girl.
Marshall. Oh, it's been so long.
God, I hated him.
Anyway, here's his obituary.
And I realized, maybe it shouldn't matter<br/>what my friends think of my girlfriend,
but it sure as hell matters what<br/>my girlfriend thinks of my friends.
- So you ended it?<br/>- Yeah.
So if you want to be my plus<br/>one, Lily's a damn good cook.
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,<br/>homemade buttermilk biscuits.
Well, no wonder Marshall dies at 68.
Thank you.
So, Robin and I enjoyed a gourmet dinner.
Well, for her it was breakfast.
And we ended up doing exactly what<br/>Lily wanted us to do all along:
We talked about our relationship.
- So, Lily broke us up, sort of.<br/>- Yeah.
- Kind of makes you wonder.<br/>- Yeah.
I mean, if it weren't for her,<br/>would we still be dating right now?
Maybe.
But Lily was right. We weren't ready.
We both need to move<br/>on, do our own thing.
Still do, I guess.
We should make a pact.
If the years go by, and we both<br/>turn 40, and we're still single...
Robin Scherbatsky...
will you be my backup wife?
A girl always dreams<br/>of hearing those words.
Yes! Yes! A million times, yes!
- All right, it's a deal.<br/>- Yeah.
So, should we set up some<br/>ground rules for this?
Okay, like what?
I don't know. Like neither one of us<br/>can get super fat. Stuff like that.
Okay, I only have one: you<br/>can't wear a nightshirt.
- I will never wear a nightshirt.<br/>- Thank God.
Never mind.
No!

I've been hired to design
a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank.
And I was eager to add as much of my voices
as an architect into the plan as possible.
Woodbeams bathed in natural light in the atrium.
They're gonna love it!
There was only one problem
and his name was Bilson
wood natural light
Ah, no!
Natural light reminds the workers<br/>that there's an outside world
where they had family and friends
We want to crash that!
You show up in the dark, you go home in the dark
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!
I need to hear Lily's voice
Who said you could leave
Bilson was killing every original idea I had
Then, one day
GNB took him off the project
and created a new task force to oversee my designs
suddenly, everything changed
We'll have a roof top in the end of the garden
for quiet contemplation
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby
where local children can come to make wishes.
The New GNB,
A place of work
that you can call "home".
Thank you, and welcome home.
Everything was going great,
until one day, in the elevator
yeah, it's ted
no, no, no, no, no, no
I did not approve that change
for the blueprints for the new GNB headquarters
which I'm the head architect,
at only 30 years old
yes, I'm single, I'm not gifted charity.
What is that has to do with anything
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.
You know that was a fake phone call, don't you
Yes, and I also know
that the new GNB headquarters project was scrapped last month
Nice try.

Check out Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.
If I could nail any celebrity
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson
Hot, talented,
and nobody does that many in Woody Allen's movies
without serious daddy's issues
If I could nail any celebrities, it would be Lily.
She's the star of my heart.
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.
You know, I don't know, celebrities,
they're into some really weird sex stuff. Trust me.
How would you know that
This is embarassing, but I...
I went home with a celebrity one night.
Oh my god! Seriously
Yeah, he wanted to do this really freaky things with me,
So I left. That's it.
End of the story.
No, no, not end of the story
I need to know who, when, and in where. Spoil it!
Lily, be calm, please settle down.
You're swallowing to much air.
But before you go any further,
I'm flattered, but technically, I'm not a celebrity.
Plus, for the last time, I put the mask on as a joke.
OK, not you Barney.
OK, who is it
OK, now you give Lily the hiccups.
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.
But all I'll say
is that he is Canadian born,
but you definitely know this guy.
And he got me back to his place
by offering to show me a very unique collection.
What do you mean collection
Well, you know some people collects
like stamps or coins, it's like that.
But I'm not telling.
Well, at least tell us the weird thing he wanted to do.
I don't know what you call it in the States,
but we have a name for it in Canada.
Look, I've already said too much.
So, mystery celebrity who collects a mystery item
asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.
Yes.
Tell us.
OK, I'll tell you.
But only if you guess all three parts correctly.
- Well, that's just impossible.<br/>- Exactly.
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.
Well, you got your Sloppy Dog Sled,
your Newfoundland Lobster Trap, your Full Mountie.
How do you know all these
- Dot org<br/>- Yeah.
It's not for profit.
They really wanna just get the information out there.
Hey, so I just had the weirdest conversation.
This woman at GNB told me
that the new bank building was scrapped last month.
It's crazy, right
Wait, what's that look
- Should we tell him<br/>- I don't wanna tell him.
- I think we should tell him.<br/>- We're not telling him.
There was no look.
Guys, what the hell
Ok, it's time that you know the truth.
A few weeks ago, Bilson called us into his office.
We're scrapping the plan for the new GNB headquarters.
This recession is killing us.
We're cutting anything non-essential.
And I have a lot of tough choices to make
to buy courtly retreat in Saint Croix.
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.
Not when he hears it coming from his best friend.
- I have to tell him!<br/>- I have to tell him!
You should tell him, you're his best friend.
I'm not, you're his best friend.
I'm not, you're his best friend.
Quiet, here he comes.
The white dude or the Asian fellow
See I bearly know the guy.
- Hey, Ted, what's up<br/>- Hey, how're you doing
I'm frustrated.
Anything innovative I put on my designs
Bilson just hacks out with a shitty
I hate to answer to a guy like that.
You should drop the project.
You should totally drop the project.
It's beneath you.
Then it's settled. To Ted Mosby's new chapter...
Are you kidding They just lay off<br/>another architect at my firm.
I mean Bilson is a pain sure.
But without this project, I'm probably out of the job.
Right, it's funny that you metioned the project.
- Because...<br/>- You're nailing it.
Keep up the good work buddy.
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.
You're shining like a diamond!
Thank you.
I needed that.
All right, I'm going to head upstairs and keep working.
I got to find a way to introduce some wood
into Bilson's dark atrium.
I think you know what I meant.
- What was that<br/>- What
I have a thought.
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm
for two more months of design work no matter what,
so couldn't we just let him
keep working and not tell him
He's had a rough year.
Let's let the guy be happy a little while longer.
Marshall, what you're suggesting
is an elaborate, long-term lie
that requires tremendous commitment.
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.
Sure I can.
Lie to me right now.
Okay.
I have a spaceship.
What kind of fuel powers your spaceship
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.
No!
Stand your ground!
If someone questions you,
distract them from the original lie with more lies.
Here, let me demonstrate.
I own a pony.
Ask me a question.
Okay.
Um, what color is your pony
Well, when I first got Dandelion,
she was a deep, chestnut brown,
but, sadly, her stable is located near a chemical plant,
which contaminated the drinking water.
So over time, she's turned a sickly, grayish-white color
and there's nothing that the vet can do to fix her.
My God!
I'm-- That's horrible.
Is Dandelion going to be okay
Okay.
All right. Huh
You are good!
Dandelion's not even sick, is she
So the building's really dead
and you guys lied to me
We, we just did it to protect you, Ted.
I can't believe this.<br/>I just got screwed by my two best friends
and I didn't even know it.
In Canada, that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow."
That building was my dream job, and now, it's just gone.
We're so sorry, Ted.
Yeah, I need a drink.
Poor Ted.
Would I seem heartless
if I switched us back to Canadian Sex Acts
- Not at all.<br/>- I'm surprised you waited this long.
What the hell is a "Two-Hand Zamboni"
Let's just say, the only thing
the woman is wearing is skates on her hands.
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache,"
but the person on the bottom
is wearing a snowsuit.
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"
Don't know. Don't want to know.
Those Newfies are out of control.
Okay! Okay, I'm going to make my first guess.
Okay, but I'll only tell you if you
correctly guess the person, the act and the collection.
Okay, I'm going to go.
Bryan Adams.
He collects baseball cards,
and he wanted to do a "Greasy Kayak."
No.
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,
a "Squatting Eskimo."
Nah-uh.
Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir shot glasses,
and a "Sticky Flapjack."
No.
That I would have done.
Wait.
Wait, if they pulled the plug on the project a month ago,
why have I been going in once a week
to meet with the New Headquarters Task Force
Well, obviously you couldn't come in
and pitch to Bilson.
So, we...invented the task force.
Then it was just a question of putting together the team.
You know Roy Waterman, Vice President of Capital and Risk
He's actually...
Roy the janitor.
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks
How naked do I have to get
Louisa Mendoza, Executive Vice President of Assets
She's actually...
Louisa the lunch lady.
Louisa, I need your help with something,
but you can't tell anybody.
No hablo Ingles.
Exactly.
This is a big secret.
How do you say "secret" in Spanish
Albondigas?
Ah, yes. Albondigas.
This will be our little albondigas.
Hey, can I, uh, have a couple meatballs, please
And Arthur Nasmith, the eccentric genius guru
of corporate investments
He's actually...
Crazy Arty, 15th Street's own one-man band.
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute to talk
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,
makes all my appointments.
We rounded out the group with a few interns
and paied everyone 50 bucks to act
super interested in what you were saying.
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.
That was some of the most inspired design work
I've done in my entire career.
I was so excited.
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",
- Beanie Babies!<br/>- Nope.
Damn it!
Wait.
So that explains the thing that happened with Louisa.
- Good job, buddy.<br/>- Nice, nice!
Listen, Louisa.
What are we gonna to do about this?
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
I know you feel it, too.
What the hell.
No, no puedo.
Me voy a casar con el senor Barney.
No! No!
No, this is wrong!
For God's sake, you're on the task force!
Is there anything else you want to tell me
Well, um, you know how you played
third base for the GNB softball team
There is no GNB softball team.
We just rented out a field,
rounded up a bunch of guys and told them
to make you the hero.
So my game-winning walk was a lie
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew that
you'd be out of work soon, and we just--
we just wanted to make you feel good.
You know, that's what friends do.
Lie to each other
Sometimes, yeah, to protect each other's feelings.
No way! You never lie to your friends.
I would never not be honest with you.
Really What about that
open mic night at the comedy club
Are you like me, folks
Have you ever thought about how many
different kinds of fish there are
And the names of those fish.
Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.
"Trout." Am I right
"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.
"Salmon."
I'm going to say that again, salmon.
Who thought that was a good idea, right
"Bass." This guy over here knows what I'm talking about.
"Halibut."
Thank you, good night.
How was I
Oh, you were great. Really funny.
You killed...
everyone's Thursday night.
Time out.
You didn't like the fish list
It was horrible! You just read a list of fish.
Anyway...
you guys just proved my point, okay
You lied to me to protect my feelings.
This is completely different!
I just wasted a month of my life working on a dead project.
That's time I could've spent
trying to bring my firm new business.
Instead, I'm going to go in there tomorrow morning.
I'm probably going to get fired.
Best case scenario,
my boss is going to ream me out in front of everybody.
Back home, we call that a Sas...
"Saskatoon Totem Pole."
- Yes.<br/>- It's on here.
Good morning, lying bastards.
Anything you want to lie about
before I head off to work to get fired
- That's a nice shirt.<br/>- You're the devil.
Ted, what if we told you that we found you
a new project at GNB where you would be
redesigning part of the 20th floor
Well, if that's a lie, it's an incredibly dull one.
What exactly would I be doing
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.
Basically, Bilson wants a room just like this,
only two stories up, on our floor.
Wait, what's an E.T.R.
It's the Employee Transition Room.
- What does that mean<br/>- Well, it's a space
where a supervisor and an employee
engage in a knowledge transfer
about an impending vocational paradigm shift.
People get fired in here.
That's horrible.
Why do you need a room specifically for firing people
Well, um, GNB feels that people need a safe,
secure space to deal with the news.
Yeah.
It gets pretty real in here.
So I reluctantly agreed to design a room
where people would be fired
But I was determined to make it my own.
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,
you'll exit into what
I'm calling the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway.
Uh-oh.
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber
with a trained grief counselor.
It's right here, past the New Beginnings Fountain.
Uh-oh.
And there you have it.
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,
a nurturing womb...
birthing you into a new life.
I love it.
- Really<br/>- Yeah.
Nice work, Ted.
Thank you.
Can you add some of these touches
to the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well
- Absolutely.<br/>- Great.
Let's take a look.
Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...
You're fired!
What!
I wanted this room!
This exact room two floors up!
But...
You're fired!
Now, get the hell out of here.
Hey, honey.
Anyone from the band Rush,
a "Montreal Meatpie," and superhero lunch boxes.
No.
Okay. Rick Moranis,
"The Reverse Rick Moranis,"
antique Judaica.
- Nah-uh.<br/>- I give up.
I've been guessing for three days.
I-I-I'm done.
If that means I never get to know,
- so be it.<br/>- Fine.
Tell us! Tell us!
Tell us!
Okay, you really want to know
Yes! Yes! Yes!
But this information
does not leave this table.
Oh, my, God.
I am so excited.
- Oh... I'm going to read it.<br/>- Read it.
- I'm going to read it.<br/>- Read it.
I'm going to read it. Here we go.
"The Frozen Snowshoe,
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."
Right
I don't know what any of those words mean.
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity
Yeah, who the hell is Old King Clancy
No, that's not the person,
that's the sex act.
It's the same as a Sacramento Turtleneck,
except with maple syrup.
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze
No, that's what he collected.
Harvey's trays.
Those classic orange trays you get
whenever you eat at Harvey's
The restaurant
Oh, come on, you're road tripping
down the Trans-Canada Highway,
you get a hunger on between Milverton and Wawa,
where you gonna strap on a feed bag, huh
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!
So the celebrity was...
The Frozen Snowshoe.
Oh, my God! You guys
have never heard of The Frozen Snowshoe
He's only the most famous
professional wrestler in Canada.
I met him after he defeated Reckless Rick Rogers
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena back in '02.
Classic match.
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe
invited you back to his place
to look at Harvey's trays,
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy
Exactly.
And I'm serious, you cannot tell anyone.
Well, my hiccups are gone.
Possibly forever.
Canada!
You did it again.
You even found a way to ruin this.
Why Why do we let you be a country
Hey, mister mister.
Hey. Shouldn't you be upstairs
designing your big, fancy E.T.R.
- I'm off the project.<br/>- What?
Bilson fired me.
You're kidding me.
So what does this mean for you at your firm?
Are you going to get laid off
Actually, I just quit.
Why
Because I can't work for big,
heartless corporate clients anymore.
When I was pitching to your "task force,"
I was doing the most inspired work of my career.
In a way, you idiots reminded me how much fun
my job can be when I'm not answering
to the Bilsons of the world, so...
I quit.
They fired you, didn't they
Yes, sir.
But I got a sweet severance package
and I've made a big decision.
I'm going to start my own firm.
Whoa, buddy. That's exciting.
Way to go. In this economy
So you're not mad
As it turns out, I'm grateful.
So how'd it all go down between you and Bilson
Well, after he proposed a vocational paradigm shift,
I made an impromptu presentation using a four-pronged approach
that really brought him to his knees.
Hit him with a chair
- Yep.<br/>- That's my boy.
And this one, I got on the drive
from Milverton to Wawa.
That's pretty impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe."
Have a seat.
So, Shoe...
How would you like to give me...
an Old King Clancy
I think you should go.

[<div class="full-script">You will not believe what happened<br/>at laser tag last night.
People freaked out because
a creepy man in a suit<br/>wouldn't leave their kids alone?
Well, yeah, pretty much.
Come on!<br/>You want it?!
My shoulder!
Come on.
Stinson, my office! Now!
Crap.
Disorderly game play,
three counts of shoving,<br/>and now this!
Stinson, you're a liability!
I know, I don't play<br/>by your precious rules, McCracken,
but, damn it, I get results!
Look, you're a good<br/>laser tag player.
Maybe the best I've ever seen.
But one of these days,<br/>you're gonna get someone hurt.
Maybe even yourself.
You just forgot<br/>what it's like out there.
You've had your fat ass stuck<br/>behind that desk for too long.
That's it!<br/>You're out of here, Stinson!
Hand in your gun and your ID badge!
With pleasure.
Please don't do this.<br/>This game is all I got.
And I've almost got enough tickets<br/>for the remote control helicopter.
Please.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
But I'm gonna give<br/>you one last shot.
But so help me,
if you so much as step one toe<br/>out of line,
you'll play Duck Hunt<br/>in your mama's basement so fast,
it's gonna make your head spin.
Now, get out of here!
You won't regret this.
That's it, Stinson.<br/>You're banned for life!
Sync by vNaru
I can't believe you got kicked out<br/>of laser tag. What are you gonna do?
What am I gonna do?<br/>What am I gonna do?
I'll tell you<br/>what Ted and I are gonna do.
We're gonna break in after hours<br/>and TP the place.
Barney, we are too old<br/>to cover a place in toilet paper
because they won't<br/>let you play laser tag.
And for that matter,<br/>too old for laser tag.
Ted, laser tag knows<br/>no age restrictions.
Kind of like stripping<br/>in the Midwest.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm adding laser tag<br/>to the Murtaugh List.
- Jeez, not the Murtaugh List.<br/>- What's the Murtaugh List?
The Murtaugh List is something<br/>that came into being
around the time I turned 30.
It all started with<br/>yourUncle Marshall's beer bong.
... two, one, chug!
When we were in our early 20s,
every time we had a party,<br/>that beer bong came out.
And around the time<br/>we turned 30, same thing.
Of course, in our early 20s,<br/>the next day would go like this.
But by the time we were 30,<br/>the next day would go like this.
Then one day, in the throes of the worst<br/>hangover of my life,
I realized there was only one person<br/>in the world that I could relate to:
Detective Roger Murtaugh,<br/>played by Danny Glover
in the'80s noir masterpiece<br/>Lethal Weapon,
known for his<br/>oft-quoted catchphrase:
- I'm too old for this...<br/>- Stuff.
He said,<br/>I'm too old for this stuff.
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,<br/>there's things you can't do anymore.
That's why I have this list, so<br/>I never make the mistake of thinking
that I can still<br/>pull an all-nighter.
I'm too old for that stuff.
Or eat an entire pizza<br/>in one sitting.
I'm too old for that stuff.
Or hang posters<br/>on your wall without frames.
"Riggs."
I'm too old for that stuff.
- By the way, how good is Lethal Weapon?<br/>- I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.
Old guy paired up<br/>with a young renegade cop.
Sound familiar?
Mackleroy and LaFleur.
Don't tell me you guys have never seen<br/>Mackleroy and LaFleur.
It's the greatest Canadian<br/>action movie of all time.
Mackleroy is a young,<br/>renegade Mountie
whose horse was just killed<br/>by evil Americans,
while LaFleur, his grouchy,<br/>old, African-Canadian partner,
just bought a cozy ice fishing<br/>shack in northern Alberta...
- I got to go.<br/>- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.
Practice?
Is he doing that one-man<br/>band thing again?
'Cause that was a bummer.
Actually,
He had just taken over
as coach for Lily's<br/>kindergarten basketball team.
He thought it'd be fun, but Lily saw it<br/>as something more: dad practice.
Hi.
Hey! Oh, my gosh!
Orange slices.<br/>That is so sweet.
- What are you doing here?<br/>- I couldn't resist.
I wanted to see<br/>Coach Marshmallow do his thing.
Hey, kids,<br/>who wants to knock off early
and have some of these here<br/>orange slices?
- Yeah!<br/>- Yeah? Well, you can't!
Because oranges are for winners,<br/>and you little turds
haven't even made a single shot yet!
You're embarrassing yourselves,<br/>you're embarrassing Ms. Aldrin,
and worst of all,<br/>you're embarrassing me!
That's it!
Suicides! Baseline! Now!
Run.
Ted, there is not<br/>a single thing on here
that you are too old to do.
In fact, if you did<br/>everything on the Murtaugh List,
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.
If you did everything<br/>on that list, you would die.
- That wasn't a challenge.<br/>- Challenge accepted.
In the next 24 hours,<br/>I'm going to do
every single thing on this list.
And after I do,
you will TP<br/>the laser tag place with me.
- And if you can't do it?<br/>- I will spend three hours
listening to you<br/>talk about architecture.
You have got yourself a deal.<br/>Robin, will you do the honors?
A gentleman's agreement!
All right, chumps, let's do this.
You really want to make this bet<br/>with him? You know how he is.
There is some pretty<br/>tough stuff on that list.
I mean, do you really think<br/>Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?
"Get ear pierced."<br/>Check.
All right, I'm off to go<br/>do laundry at Mom's house.
You mind if I crash<br/>on your futon tonight?
- We don't have a futon.<br/>- Put it over there, boys.
- What's going on?<br/>- It's on the Murtaugh List.
"Crash on a friend's futon<br/>instead of getting a hotel room."
I am too old for that stuff.
What's going on with your ear?
Looks like the inside<br/>of a jack-o'-lantern on November 3rd.
What, this?<br/>Ah, just a little infecsh.
Nothing a young guy like me<br/>can't shake off.
Plus, "Put off going<br/>to the doctor," on the list.
Hold on.
Go for Bar...
Keep running!
You know what's funny is, I was supposed<br/>to come here to teach them...
Do not stop running!
This whole time, they've been<br/>the ones who are teaching me.
That's not running!<br/>That's falling!
The next morning, Barney woke up<br/>on the futon in our living room.
Check.
"Drinking shots with strangers."
Check.
You OK, Barney?<br/>It looks like you hurt your back.
Oh, no.<br/>Just rocking a party hunch.
I like it.
Closer to my booze.<br/>To youth.
Can I get a straw?
I must say,<br/>there's something admirable
about the way he wants<br/>to stay young at heart.
- I mean, who wants to get old?<br/>- This guy.
Life is a meal<br/>and old age is the dessert.
I spend so much of my time<br/>worrying about the future.
Where's my career going?<br/>Who am I gonna marry?
But when you're old,<br/>you don't worry,
'cause all that stuff's<br/>already happened.
You get to wear comfy shoes<br/>and a chair takes you up
and down the stairs, it's perfect.
That's not perfect.<br/>That's pathetic.
You can't just jump to the end.<br/>The journey is the best part.
I used to feel that way, too,
but you'll understand<br/>when you're a little bit older.
Marshall, can you try<br/>not to pick on the kids today.
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.
I'm picking on the culture<br/>of losing around here.
I got to get them in shape
if they're gonna win<br/>that game tomorrow.
Win?
We don't keep score.
- What?<br/>- We don't keep score.
You don't keep s...
What's the point of playing<br/>if you don't keep score?
How do you know...
Lily, what were you doing<br/>with this team before I got here?
I was coaching them.
That's it, my little angels.
You're all luminous<br/>wonderful beings of light.
- What's the score?<br/>- It's all tied up at fun to fun!
Because that's the point of playing,<br/>to have fun.
The point of playing<br/>is to win the trophy.
And if you don't know who's<br/>winning, who gets the trophy?
Everyone.
It's a participation trophy,<br/>everyone gets one.
It's like you're speaking<br/>Chinese to me right now.
- Hi, this is Barney.<br/>- And Robin.
- We can't answer the phone because...<br/>- He's watching sports and I'm...
Probably out shopping.
Leave a message,<br/>we'll call you back just as soon...
- As...<br/>- We...
Can!
"Leave an annoying two-person message<br/>on your answering machine."
Check.
Probably gonna cost me<br/>some dates, but it's okay.
Your ear's starting to smell.
It's good.
I hate to send it back,
but you did describe the turkey<br/>as extremely lean,
and, well, you tell me.
All right. That's it.
- We have our own list.<br/>- What?
This is a list of things<br/>you're too young to do.
Go out and do each one of these things,<br/>tell me you still want to be an old man.
Remove "colonoscopy"<br/>and "Have sex with an old lady",
and this is a cakewalk.
New stakes, then.
If I can finish your list<br/>before you finish mine,
you have to come with me<br/>to TP laser tag
and you have to buy<br/>the toilet paper.
And none of that biodegradable crap.<br/>I want it up there forever.
Fine,<br/>but if I finish your list first,
it's a six hour survey
of early 20th century<br/>American architecture
and you can never do anything<br/>on the Murtaugh List ever again.
- It's for your own good.<br/>- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.
A gentleman's agreement!
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.<br/>This isn't how you teach basketball.
Sure it is. It's the way I learned.
Are you kidding me?
What kind of sociopath<br/>taught you this way?
Come on, Dad. I'm tired.
Sleep is for winners.
You can go to bed<br/>when you score a basket.
I'm trying.
Let's give you<br/>two points for trying.
But negative two points<br/>for having a great big head.
My father gave me no quarter
and I asked for no quarter.
I totally got to call that guy.
Keep stretching!
"Put on reading glasses." Check.
"Yell at neighborhood kids."
My pleasure.
- What the hell happened to you?<br/>- I just had a very minor
"blew out my knee<br/>and it hurts like hell" incident.
- How did you blow out your knee?<br/>- We...
"Helped someone move out of a 6th floor<br/>walk-up in exchange for pizza and beer."
Or we helped someone<br/>rob a sixth floor walk-up.
They were in a big hurry<br/>and left all the pictures behind.
Whatevs, it counts.
Now, I am off to<br/>"Dye my hair a funny color",
and then we are going to,<br/>"Go to a rave".
4:00!
Supper time.
So, your dad was tough on you.
That stinks,<br/>but you don't have to be like him.
You can learn from his mistakes.
Mistakes?<br/>Lily, scoreboard.
The guy nailed it, okay?<br/>He taught me how to be a winner.
That's what I'm teaching these kids.<br/>And, for that matter,
that's what I'm gonna teach<br/>our kids someday.
Okay, that's it.
This is not<br/>how we're gonna raise our kids!
And this is not<br/>how you're gonna coach this team!
At tomorrow's game,<br/>if you are anything less
than a teddy bear stuffed<br/>with cotton candy and rainbows,
I will silent treatment<br/>your ass into the ground!
You'll think the time I found<br/>your Internet search history
was a freakin' picnic!
Are we clear?
- There are many different philo...<br/>- Are we clear?
Yes, ma'am.
What's ironic is that now...
Just call Ted.
I want to go home.
All right.<br/>I'm calling him.
But it's 4:30 in the morning.<br/>He's not going to be awake.
Up at 4:00...
Check.
- Is he answering?<br/>- I haven't dialed yet.
Please hurry, Robin.
Perfect.
"Take forever to answer the phone."
Come on, Ted.
Someone gave me some aspirin<br/>and I don't think it was aspirin.
Check.
So, I know that I have been<br/>a little tough on you
for the past couple days.
And I apologize for that.
So today, we're not gonna<br/>worry about winning.
We're gonna go out there and...
have fun.
Kids, over the years,<br/>your uncle Marshall has told and retold
the story of this game<br/>hundreds of times. And in reality,
the kids on that other team<br/>were probably only a grade older.
But, in telling<br/>and retelling the story,
they came to look like this.
Way to let them score that easily.
Now, you're sitting down.<br/>Awesome.
Addison, it's not soccer.
You don't kick the ball!
Unless that's something<br/>that you think is fun,
in which case, great job having fun.
- That was a foul, wasn't it, Ref?<br/>- My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.
- And watch your tone.<br/>- No tone, Kenny.
Great job, Kenny.
Thanks a lot, Kenny.
See you later, Kenny.
All right, Barney. As your manager,<br/>I am throwing in the towel.
This bet is over.<br/>Your ear looks like
a free Danish<br/>at a continental breakfast.
No. One thing left.<br/>"Beer bong."
Coming right up.
Oh, I...
found these weird Russian beers<br/>in the basement.
Russian beers?<br/>I'll take a brewski.
Brewski. Get it?
Yeah, it's...
It's a little warm.<br/>Hope that's not a problem.
No, don't, don't.
All right, Ted.<br/>You win. I hate this.
I hate all of it.
My back is killing me.
Everyone at the rave<br/>thought I was a narc.
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it...
I can hear my own ear.<br/>Think about that.
My clothes... What is it...<br/>What is it... What am I...
Get this stuff off of me!
Ted, I'll pay you double<br/>for your finest suit.
Here's...
30 bucks.
And throw in the shoes.
You win, Ted.
I'll never do anything<br/>on the Murtaugh List again.
I'm too old for this stuff.
You know, Barney, last night,<br/>I went to bed at 8:00
because it was on the list,<br/>and I couldn't sleep because...
well, it was 8:00.
So I decided to watch Lethal Weapon.
And then,<br/>when I still couldn't sleep,
I watched Lethal Weapon 2.
And then I watched 3.
And then, halfway through<br/>Lethal Weapon 4,
is when it occurred to me...
Murtaugh kept saying,<br/>"I'm too old for this stuff",
but every time he'd say it,
he'd turn around,<br/>make another movie,
and do more stuff.
I guess what I'm saying is...
screw being old.
Let's go TP laser tag.
And then the hospital.
Great job, guys.
At least we're not keeping score, right?<br/>No idea what the score is.
Could be 53 to zero.
Could be some other score.<br/>It's 53 to zero.
What are we doing wrong, Coach?
You know what?<br/>You're not doing anything wrong.
It's great that you guys are losing,
because in life, it doesn't matter<br/>how much effort you put in,
or how hard you try,
people will just give you things.
Like diplomas and jobs<br/>and promotions.
So, it doesn't matter<br/>what you do out there,
as long as...<br/>as long as you have fun.
At that point, because they didn't want<br/>to fight in front of the kids,
your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily had<br/>one of their telepathic conversations.
- Don't you give me that look.<br/>- Lily, I can't take it anymore!
Your way of coaching is crazy!
Stop yelling at me!
Sorry.
But can I please do it my way?
Fine, but I'm going<br/>to do it my way, too.
I'm getting my guitar.
I don't know if it was<br/>Marshall's tough attitude,
Lily's gentle encouragement,
or some magical combination<br/>of the two,
but in the second half of that game,
that ragtag group<br/>of little firecrackers...
got beat down even worse.
In fact, according<br/>to your uncle Marshall,
in the second half,<br/>the other team got even taller.
And one of them<br/>turned into a Teen Wolf.
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf<br/>on the court!
That can't be legal.
I know the Teen Wolf<br/>looks different, kids,
but try to make sure<br/>he feels included.
How is that not traveling, Kenny?
You are killing me!<br/>You are absolutely killing me!
Watch it, Coach,<br/>or you'll get a technical.
I am begging you<br/>to give me a technical.
When the final horn mercifully blew,
the score was,<br/>by Marshall's estimate, 118 to nothing.
And even though<br/>they didn't win anything,
everyone, even the coach,<br/>got a participation trophy.
I understand if you don't want it.
I love it.
I worked so hard. It feels good<br/>to be appreciated for my effort.
I know, baby.
Maybe your way<br/>is not totally stupid.
Thanks.
Your way is totally stupid.
Son...
you have been a pain in my ass<br/>ever since you joined this club.
But damn it...
if this ain't some<br/>of the finest TP work I've ever seen.
You're reinstated...
effective immediately.
Really?
Hell, no!
I'm calling the police!
Grown-ass man with pink hair throwing<br/>toilet paper. You're kidding me.
- I'm too old for this...<br/>- Stuff.
He said stuff.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">- I heard this great joke at work.<br/>- Dude, come on.
She's not gonna like it.<br/>It's boy-funny. It's not girl-funny.
That is sexist!
Funny is funny, Ted.
Lily's cool.<br/>She'll appreciate this.
- You're on your own, man.<br/>- Just tell me the joke.
Okay. Ready?
Lily, what's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?
- See? It's funny.<br/>- It's boy-funny.
- She's not gonna like it.<br/>- Why don't you let me decide?
What's the difference<br/>between peanut butter and jam?
And then Barney said the punch line.
To this day,<br/>it's still the dirtiest joke
I've ever heard in my life.<br/>And no, I'm not gonna say it.
Yeah, I can't hang out<br/>with you anymore.
Oh, come on.
That's a funny joke. That...
Told you.
She'll be back.
And we didn't see Lily<br/>for four weeks.
Sync by vNaru
Kids, after getting laid off,
I was finally pursuing<br/>my lifelong dream:
Starting my own architecture firm.
All I needed was some clients.
I think it's so great that<br/>you're striking out on your own, Ted.
- I admire that.<br/>- Thanks.
And thanks for being so cool<br/>with me using the apartment.
Yeah, of course.<br/>Anything you need.
Small thing, do you mind not watching<br/>television during business hours?
- This isn't working!<br/>- I'm sorry. It's just, I....
I can't concentrate<br/>while Wheel of Fortune is...
A penny saved<br/>is a Penny Marshall! Yes!
Ted, I know you're nervous,<br/>but you've got to stop procrastinating.
You've spent the last two days choosing<br/>the official pen of Mosbius Designs.
I've made some progress!
I've eliminated felt-tip.
Who am I kidding?<br/>Felt's back in the ballgame.
Hey. You hear there's gonna be<br/>more layoffs?
I know. I'm freaking out.
- Are you worried?<br/>- Are you kidding?
The things I know about this company.<br/>I won't ever be fired.
There's a pretty good chance one day
I'll wash up on shore<br/>with no fingerprints or teeth,
but I won't be fired.
I wish I had your confidence.
Look, you just need a way to make<br/>yourself absolutely essential.
Well, I work harder<br/>than anyone in my division.
Yeah. Keeping your job has<br/>nothing to do with hard work.
- You need a thing.<br/>- What do you mean, a thing?
You know, something
that makes you fun<br/>and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.
Marcus Denisco worked<br/>in account services
and was perhaps the most expendable<br/>employee at the company.
I brought some donuts.<br/>They're probably stupid.
But eventually,<br/>he came to be known as...
Food Guy!
Who wants some pulled pork?<br/>Of course you do! Come on!
I love Food Guy.
They could never lay him off.<br/>You know what I love about Food Guy?
- He always has food.<br/>- He always has food.
See? That's what you need.
You need that thing<br/>that makes you a guy.
I have that thing<br/>that makes me a guy.
Maybe even a guy and a half.
Not that thing.<br/>You know, a thing. Like Toy Guy.
Guys, bad news.
As your HR rep,
I got to review the new overtime<br/>scheduling policy with you.
The good news is we're gonna do it<br/>while wearing Wolverine claws!
Section 5A:
Overtime will no longer be paid
at time and a half.<br/>This is awesome!
Claw five!
I love Toy Guy.
See? You need a thing.
Like YouTube Clip Guy.
You're right.
I do need a thing.
But choose wisely.
You don't want<br/>to be Creepy Back Rub Guy.
Don't fill up. Food Guy's<br/>got panna cotta in his office.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Douglas.
You're so tight.
I was relaxed about two seconds ago.
You're next.
Hi. Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
- Who the hell are you?<br/>- I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.
- What the hell is going on?<br/>- I'm sorry. We do not interrupt
Mr. Mosby during<br/>his brainstorming hour.
It's okay, PJ. That's Robin.
She lives here.
I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.
Do you need anything else?
- I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee.<br/>- You're right there!
So now, Ted has an assistant<br/>to help him not do anything.
PJ's been a huge help to me,
setting up the office,<br/>designing the Web site.
And in return, I'm mentoring<br/>a bright young mind.
Yes, the mentoring.
I want you to go outside<br/>today and simply...
put your hands on buildings.
All right? Feel
the concrete pulse.
Listen... Listen to the stories<br/>the stones are telling you.
And pick up my dry cleaning.
I will.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mosby.<br/>- All right.
This table just told me<br/>you're a douche.
This whole mentoring thing<br/>is just another way to procrastinate
- from actually calling clients.<br/>- I'm not procrastinating.
I just... I want everything<br/>to be perfect, okay?
I only get one shot at this.
Fine, but PJ is not helping.
If Ted says that PJ<br/>is important to the company,
then PJ is not going anywhere.
See? He's very valuable.
PJ's a guy?
PJ's not some hot chick<br/>you're banging?
No, I'm mentoring him.
Mentoring.
I mentored a young fellow once.<br/>Even made him my wingman.
Then, one day, he hired an assistant
to work ten feet<br/>from his bedroom who...
get this... isn't a hot chick,
proving he never listened<br/>to a word I said.
And do you know<br/>that young man's name?
Maybe. I don't remember.
Because he is dead to me!
PJ's gonna be getting<br/>a very confusing card in the mail,
along with a garment<br/>that he should by no means wear
for three days<br/>and then mail back to me.
I thought of a "thing"<br/>to make me more essential here.
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody loves<br/>a guy who recycles, right?
Fired. What else you got?
I thought of a few others:<br/>Wacky Tie Guy.
- Fired.<br/>- Daily Fun Fact Guy?
Did you know that you're fired?
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?
Downward-facing fired.
Monty Python Guy?
We are the knights who say...
You're fired.
Wait! Wait!<br/>I did used to run
a fantasy baseball league<br/>back in law school.
That's not bad.<br/>You might be on to something.
Awesome. Awesome!<br/>I'll be Fantasy Guy!
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.<br/>We already have a Fantasy Guy.
- What's up, bros?<br/>- Hey, Frank.
Hello?
Where are you?<br/>You're never late.
You're on top<br/>of the Empire State Building?
Listen to the old gal.<br/>She's got some stories to tell.
Take all the time you need.
Wait a second.<br/>"Ted Mosby Home".
Oh my God, the call is coming<br/>from inside the house.
That's not<br/>the Empire State Building.
Robin, you cannot sleep<br/>with my assistant.
I'm trying to run a business here.<br/>How did this even happen?
Well, at lunch, when you go<br/>on your wisdom walks,
it gives me and PJ<br/>some time alone together.
Inspiration... do your thing.
It always does, sir.
It always does.
Hey, PJ, I actually have<br/>an architectural question for you.
How does Ted's ass taste?
I wouldn't know, but I assume<br/>it tastes like genius.
Why is the bathroom locked?
Visitors need to sign in<br/>for the bathroom key.
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think<br/>this over real good
before you answer.<br/>Are you telling me that I can't
go to the bathroom in my apartment?
I am telling you that you need<br/>to ask permission
to use the bathroom in my office.
Why is that so hot?
There are billions<br/>of guys in the world.
Why do you have to sleep with him?
Ted, when I get off work,<br/>it's 5:30 in the morning.
Do you have any idea<br/>what kind of guys I'm meeting?
I deliver newspapers. It's a dirty job,<br/>but somebody's got to do it.
Don't worry. I'll wash them<br/>before I handle your business.
I live with my mom.<br/>At night, we watch TV in her bed.
We call it "Cuddle Club".
So, you, get up really early to trade<br/>on the European stock exchanges?
What's that like?
Look, is this going<br/>to happen or not?
Okay, first of all,<br/>I've hung out with Fantasy Guy.
You could do a lot worse.<br/>Secondly,
this has to stop.
Distracting PJ is going<br/>to kill our productivity.
What productivity? You haven't<br/>even called a single client.
Once I get the Web site up,
the brochures printed,<br/>and figure out what trusts games
we're going to play at the corporate<br/>retreat, I am making those calls.
Corporate retreat?
Mr. Mosby and I are going camping<br/>on the roof.
Hey, Sports Guy. I hear people<br/>are raving about your league.
It's a lot harder<br/>than I thought it would be.
Between entry fees<br/>and transaction fees
and penalty fees, I'm actually...
I'm holding on to a lot of money.
Great work, Sports Guy.
That's for last week.
60,
80, a hundred.
This is $18,000 cash.
It's not a big deal.
I'll just take it home<br/>and put it somewhere safe.
Okay, just walking down the street
with some money in my pocket.
Don't touch the money.
That's so obvious.<br/>Just be cool.
The baby's on to me.<br/>Babies can smell money.
Everyone knows that!
I'm carrying a lot of money!
Seriously, dude,
I'm not sure how much longer<br/>I can keep doing this.
Marshall, last week you were trash
that no one wanted to look at.<br/>Now, you're Sports Guy.
- I was trash?<br/>- Last week!
There's Ted Mosby<br/>of Mosbius Designs.
How's the home office coming, buddy?
It was going great till Robin started<br/>banging my assistant.
It's our apartment, okay? You leave<br/>a big chocolate cake on the counter,
Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.
I told you.
Hire a cute assistant<br/>that you can sleep with,
but instead you hire a cute assistant<br/>that Robin can sleep with.
And of course he's gonna sleep with her.<br/>She's the greatest woman on the planet!
I'm getting off topic!<br/>You're an idiot!
That's my message!<br/>You're an idiot!
One person storming off isn't enough!<br/>Marshall, storm off with me!
Dude, why are this upset
about Ted not having sex<br/>with the people he hires?
Because it hurts!
- It hurts you how?<br/>- It hurts because I love...
Ted.
Having sex with women.
I'm a very dedicated wingman!
Look, Lily's the only person<br/>that I can talk to about this stuff.
Just get her to talk to me.
I'll try, but there's no guarantees.
She's still really outraged<br/>about that joke.
That joke.
Torn our little group apart,
pitted people I love<br/>against each other.
Seriously, I wish...
I wish that joke had never come<br/>into our lives.
- It's kinda of funny though, right?<br/>- It's so funny, man.
Hey, good news, PJ.
The brochures you designed just came in.<br/>Really interesting choice for the cover.
I like how instead of one<br/>of my designs,
you chose this.
You know what?
I must've sent in the wrong photo.
You think?
Look, PJ,<br/>the Web site's still not done.
You didn't even show up<br/>to the corporate retreat...
by the way, I saw a shooting star...
... and you're late every day.<br/>I'm sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.
- You're fired.<br/>- You can't fire...
PJ, you're fired.
Fine!
Hey, baby.
I just got fired.
Yeah, I'll wait for you<br/>at your place.
Wheel of Fortune.
I love having all this free time<br/>to spend with you.
I'm going to kiss you here...
And here.
And here and here.
And...
- One more.<br/>- Please stop.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<br/>I'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
- You're already sick of him.<br/>- He's driving me crazy.
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.
He was guardian of the bathroom key.
A hot guy telling you<br/>when you can and can't pee?
That's the dream.
"That's the dream"?
The dream?
Like what Martin Luther King<br/>was talking about?
I have to end it, don't I?
I'm terrible at breakups.
I still have to go a little bit, but<br/>I couldn't be away from you 1 s longer.
Listen...
Dude, I don't know.
- What?<br/>- Yeah, it's just...
It's not really...
ix-nay, you know?
Ix-nay on what?
Not feeling it.
Not feeling what?
But friends and stuff.
My God, this is<br/>the worst breakup ever.
You're breaking up with me?
If that's what you want,<br/>I totally understand.
You still haven't activated that<br/>shortstop the Mariners just brought up.
Got to have it.
See, Sports Guy!<br/>People love you.
I can't be Sports Guy anymore, okay?<br/>It's killing me!
I keep getting<br/>these constant texts and e-mails
and phone calls<br/>in the middle of the night.
Sometimes I even think<br/>that I'm being followed.
Hey, buddy.
I need you to push that trade through,<br/>so I can set my new lineup.
You really carry it<br/>in your shoulders, don't you?
Seriously, it's over.
Do you want me to stop?
With Robin and PJ broken up,
I was free to make<br/>some staffing changes in the office.
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
You got to be kidding me?
And now that PJ was back at work...
You got to be kidding me?
So, apparently Robin and PJ<br/>are an item again.
You got to be kidding me!
Are you all right?
Since Lily's not talking to me,
there's something I have to tell you.<br/>And this isn't easy to say, all right?
I'm... wait for it...
in... wait for it...
love... wait for it...
with... wait for it...
a... wait for it...
- certain... wait for it...<br/>- I know that you're in love with Robin.
- What?<br/>- Lily told me.
She told you?
Great.
I bet you guys have been laughing at me<br/>behind my back the whole time.
Actually, in a weird way,
we both think you're kind<br/>of perfect for each other.
You do?
Matter of fact,<br/>we even try to sit on the same side
of the booth so you two<br/>will have to sit together.
Really? That's so sweet.
But let's be clear.
I don't love her. Okay?<br/>I just...
miss her when she's not around.<br/>I think about her all the time,
and I imagine us one day running towards<br/>each other in slow motion,
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.
Are you ever gonna tell her<br/>how you feel?
Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...
I just need to get<br/>that PJ idiot away from her.
If Lily were here, she'd know exactly<br/>how to get rid of him.
- Maybe I can help.<br/>- Marshall, you're no Lily.
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,<br/>subtly manipulating
every situation to get<br/>exactly what she wants.
She's pure evil, Marshall.
You got a good one there.<br/>Hang on to her.
Meanwhile, my bizarre tug of war<br/>with Robin over PJ continued.
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.
Want to join me?
I took the bathroom key<br/>without asking.
What are you gonna do about it?
Look...
you guys are both great.<br/>But the truth is I'm taking another job.
These are for you.<br/>Robin, I hope this letter
offers some closure.
I'm really going to miss you.
You can't trade Manny Ramirez<br/>for two middle relievers!
If you veto that trade,<br/>I am out of the league!
I'll figure it out.
Hire the kid to be a "paralegal".
He gets to do all the work,<br/>and you still get to be Sports Guy.
Pure evil, Eriksen.<br/>Pure evil.
You okay?
What if I don't think of the books?
Excuse me?
There's this famous architecture story<br/>about an architect
who designed this library.
It was perfect.
But every year,<br/>the whole thing would sink
a couple inches into the ground.
Eventually, the building<br/>was condemned.
He forgot to account<br/>for the weight of the books.
This company... it's just me.
What if I don't think of the books?
First of all, nobody goes to libraries<br/>anymore, so who cares about that guy?
Secondly, you need to get<br/>on the phone and start calling clients.
The longer I put off<br/>starting my own firm,
the longer it can remain a dream
and not something I screwed up at.
It's like I'm giving up<br/>before I even started.
You want to talk about giving up?
I used to describe my ideal guy as<br/>"funny, smart,
"passionate, challenging".
And now, apparently,<br/>I will settle for...
"in my apartment".
Didn't you think you'd have it<br/>all more figured out by now?
Are you kidding? By 30,<br/>I was gonna be annoyingly successful,
married to the perfect woman,<br/>maybe a kid on the way.
Instead, I'm just some guy<br/>sitting in his apartment,
having a staring contest<br/>with his phone.
And losing.
You can take that thing.
Hi, this is Ted Mosby<br/>of Mosbius Designs.
I'm calling to inquire about any design<br/>needs you may have now or in the future.
- That sounds great.<br/>- Really? I sound confident?
- Now call an actual client.<br/>- Great.
Hey, Food Guy!
Hey, Toy Guy!
Who's that guy?
He doesn't work here.<br/>I think we should leave the building.
- Really?<br/>- This has happened before.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Great. So, I'll give you a call.
I hope you do.
- Look at this.<br/>- I just got that girl's number.
Check it out. Holly.
Nice.
Girls whose names end<br/>in L-Y are always dirty.
Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.
Yeah, I know it's true.
And don't even<br/>get me started on girls
whose names should end in Y,<br/>but instead end in I.
Those girls are like<br/>roller coasters.
You got to wait in a long line,<br/>but once you get up there,
you just hold on for dear life<br/>and hope you don't drop your keys.
You know what I'm gonna do?<br/>I'm gonna call her right now.
I'm gonna do that whole,<br/>"Remember me? It's been so long".
See, it's funny<br/>because I just saw her.
You can't call her.
You have to wait 3 days<br/>to call a woman. That's the rule.
Barney, that rule<br/>is completely played out.
Girls know exactly<br/>what you're doing.
I got a new rule.
It's kind of crazy, but I call it,
you like her, you call her.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?<br/>I don't speak "I never get laid".
Barney, the 3 days rule is insane.
I mean, who even came up with that?
Jesus.
Barney, don't do this.<br/>Not with Jesus.
Seriously.
Jesus started<br/>the whole wait 3 days thing.
He waited 3 days to come back to life.<br/>It was perfect.
If he have only waited one day,
people wouldn't have<br/>even heard that he died.
They'd be all, "Jesus, what up?"
And Jesus would probably be,<br/>like, "What up? I died yesterday".
And then they'd be all,<br/>"You look pretty alive to me, dude".
And then he would have to explain<br/>how he was resurrected
and how it was a miracle.
And then, the dude would be, like,<br/>"Okay, whatever you say, bro".
Ancient dialogue<br/>sounds so stilted now.
And he's not going<br/>to come back on a Saturday.
Everybody's busy doing chores.
Working the loom,<br/>trimming their beards.
No. He waits the exact<br/>right number of days...
Three.
OK, I promise, I'll wait three days.<br/>Just please stop talking.
Plus, it's Sunday,<br/>so everyone's in church already.
They're all in there,<br/>"No, Jesus is dead".
Then, bam! He bursts through<br/>the back door, runs up the aisle.
Everyone's totally psyched.<br/>And, FYI,
that's when<br/>he invented the high-five.
Three days, Ted.<br/>We wait three days to call a woman
because that's how long Jesus<br/>wants us to wait.
True story.
Sync by vNaru
Okay, fine.<br/>I promise.
I won't call Holly for three days.
But I never said anything<br/>about texting.
I started things off with something<br/>cute and charming.
"I was thinking about you, so I thought<br/>I'd send you a little texty text."
And the moment I hit "Send",<br/>I realized it wasn't cute at all.
It was the lamest thing<br/>anyone has ever said to anyone.
And the worst thing about texting<br/>is that once you send it...
... you can never get it back.
And then... you wait.
And just when you've decided<br/>never to text anyone again...
"I've been thinking about you, too,
"and how weird is it that you texted me<br/>while I was in the bath?"
- What was that?<br/>- What?
- You made a noise.<br/>- That was my phone. I got a text.
Not that. You made<br/>your naked lady noise.
- What?!<br/>- Whenever you see a naked lady,
you make the noise.
- I don't do that.<br/>- Really?
God, sorry, Lily.
While the men are out hunting,
the women of New Guinea's<br/>indigenous Korowai tribe
wash their clothes in the river.
That's totally a boob.
Is that Holly who keeps texting you?<br/>Didn't you promise to wait three days?
To call, yes.<br/>Texting is totally different.
Okay, well, just try to keep<br/>the naked lady noises to a minimum.
I don't make a naked lady noise.
Really?
Holly and I stayed up texting<br/>until 2:00 in the morning.
And we spent the whole next day<br/>texting each other, too.
She seemed perfect.
Holly just told me what she's wearing<br/>right now. It is pretty hot.
Yeah, whatever it is, I can<br/>guarantee you she's not wearing it.
She's lying to make you like her.
How do you know that?
Because no woman<br/>in the history of the world is ever
"just sitting around reading<br/>architecture magazines in my old
"cheerleader uniform."
Okay, maybe she's lying<br/>about the architecture magazines.
- No. This is bad.<br/>- What?
She just sent me a text that was<br/>clearly meant for someone else.
"Baby, I picked up some take-out<br/>from Generro's. Be home soon."
Okay, yes, this sounds bad,<br/>but let's think about this, okay?
It could be for a brother<br/>or maybe her sick dad.
Scroll down.
"And then I want you to<br/>do me on the couch."
Okay, maybe not a sick dad.
Or a very sick dad.<br/>Am I right?
Sorry.
Hey, guys.
God. What is this?
It's some take-out from Generro's.<br/>I'm bringing it home for Lily.
That's weird.
Holly just texted Ted something<br/>about take-out from Generro's.
Wait a second.
You sons of bitches.
What?
You're Holly.
So Ted hasn't been texting<br/>Holly at all?
He's been texting you two?
Look, we knew he'd try to call her<br/>before the three days,
so I swiped his phone, and I changed<br/>her number to my work cell.
We were just gonna bust on him<br/>for calling her too soon, but then he...
started texting her.
"Texty text"?!
Poor, sweet Ted.<br/>We should...
- we should tell him it's us.<br/>- Yeah.
Or...
we pretend we're Holly,<br/>and we're in the bath.
Yeah, that's better.
That was fun.
- We should tell him that it's us.<br/>- Yeah, we should.
Or...
we tell him<br/>our favorite color is red,
and we think the cowboy look<br/>is very sexy.
Yeah, that's better.
I'm wearing them right now,<br/>and they do look sexy.
- He put on the boots!<br/>- He totally put on the boots!
That was awesome!
But it's time to tell him<br/>who he really put those boots on for.
Yeah.<br/>Or...
we just took off our shirt.
Yeah, that's better.
You think maybe we're wearing<br/>a black lace bra underneath?
I don't think we're wearing anything<br/>underneath.
God, we're hot.
Now he's only wearing<br/>the cowboy boots!
- It is on!<br/>- It is so on!
Tell him that we're...<br/>we're slowing slipping out of our...
What are we doing?
I think that we're...
about to have sex with Ted.
So, you did this to him all day?
That's just mean.
No, it was...<br/>it was actually for his own good.
We're protecting him from himself.<br/>He... really likes this girl.
He had that look in his eye.
Yeah, that crazy "I'm about to move<br/>too fast and screw this up" look.
The same look he had<br/>on his first date with you.
We all remember how that went.
- I think I'm in love with you.<br/>- What?
Yeah, well,<br/>I think I was a special case.
This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.
What is the deal with her hair?
I mean, news flash:
They make conditioners<br/>that don't leave a buildup.
I'm so bad.
Look, it's been a while<br/>since Ted really liked someone.
He's clearly got a lot of crazy<br/>stored up. We just...
we thought we'd get him<br/>to say "I love you"
before he makes contact<br/>with this girl.
And you can tell it's on the way.<br/>He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.
Yeah. One:<br/>He joked about getting married.
"You like architecture?<br/>We should get married.
"Ha-ha. LOL. Just kidding.<br/>Question mark?"
Two: He made a crazy way<br/>too soon trip suggestion.
"I like beer, too.
"We should totally go<br/>to Germany together.
"LOL. JK. LOL."
And three:<br/>He got way too personal way too soon.
"Yeah, my parents got divorced<br/>a couple years back.
"It was really tough.
"LOL."
And he clearly doesn't know<br/>what LOL means.
Yeah, but here's the real problem.<br/>Ted wasn't saying "I love you"
as easily as we thought he would.
Then we met... Stan.
Why are you making<br/>so much noise, man?
So we explained everything to him,<br/>and when we were done,
something amazing happened.
Why don't you tell Ted<br/>that just knowing he's out there,
thinking about you,<br/>caring about you,
makes you feel safe?
So, all your fears,<br/>all your yesterdays wash away,
and only hope remains<br/>in the promise of his embrace.
Go, Stan.
- Who is this guy?<br/>- A security guard who works nights.
- He eats lunch at MacLaren's every day.<br/>- And he wasn't done.
Not by a long shot.
You make me thank God<br/>for every mistake I ever made
because each one led me down<br/>the path that brought me to you.
That's... really nice, man.
Whatever. It's okay.
"And when we finally come together,
"I want you to hold me.
Hold me all night.
Stroke my hair.
Tell me I'm a woman<br/>and show me you're a man.
Until there there was only now.
You and I...
and now.
You want me to text that to Ted.
I know that.
"I do not ask<br/>of the night explanations.
"I wait for it, and it envelops me,
"and so you and bread
"and light and shadow are."
That's Pablo Neruda.
I don't know...
what bread was doing in there,<br/>but that touched me here
and here.
Well, if Ted won't say it, I will.
I love you.
That's cool.
Still nothing, huh?
Maybe he's not in love with us.
How can he not be in love with us?<br/>We're everything he's looking for.
I don't get men.
Got to head to work.
Will you be...<br/>Will you be back?
I'll be back when the wind<br/>and fates and chance bring me back.
Which will be tomorrow.
It's cheese steak day.
It sounds like<br/>you were all over this guy.
Hope his girlfriend<br/>didn't get jealous.
Did he mention a girlfriend or...?
It was all going great
until Marshall sent Ted<br/>a text meant for Lily
- and ruined everything.<br/>- It doesn't matter.
Okay? It's over now.
I got to get going,<br/>but here's what's gonna happen:
You're going to call him right now,
tell him what you did,<br/>and apologize.
You got it?
Or...
Holly explained everything.<br/>It was all just a misunderstanding.
Everything's great now.
Really?
How did Holly explain<br/>her way out of that one?
Apparently,
her dumb friend Marsha<br/>accidentally used her phone
- to text her husband Billy.<br/>- Marsha and Billy.
No one sprained any muscles there.
And now we are better than ever.
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I might actually<br/>be falling for this girl.
You're falling<br/>for Barney and Marshall.
- What?<br/>- They didn't believe
that you could wait the 3 days,
so Barney changed her number<br/>in your phone to his work cell.
Holly is Barney and Marshall.
Wait. That whole time it was them?
So Holly wasn't in the bath?
Or sitting by her window, looking up<br/>at the stars, thinking about me?
Or lounging<br/>in her old cheerleader uniform
reading architecture magazines?
Yeah. I don't think<br/>they actually did those things.
They were just at the bar.
Right.
But, it was them.
- Unbelievable.<br/>- I know.
So you might as well tell them<br/>you're on to them.
Or...
I text them something<br/>that will really mess with their heads.
Oh, I gotcha.
How about...
"I haven't told any<br/>of my friends yet,
but I only have three months<br/>to live"?
Not bad.
How about "I once killed a man<br/>with a shovel,
and those feelings<br/>are creeping up again"?
I liked that thing<br/>someone said before
about having three months to live.
How about "I never told anyone this,
but I slept<br/>with my best friend's mom"?
That is good, but I feel<br/>like we keep coming back
to that three months to live thing.
Wait.<br/>I think I got it.
He texted back!
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.
"I mean we barely know each other.
"But what the hell,<br/>I'll just say it."
This is it, dude.<br/>Here comes the "I love you."
- I wish Stan were here.<br/>- Stan.
What?
"I sometimes have gay dreams<br/>about my best friend."
"I sometimes have gay dreams<br/>about my best friend."
Why in the world would Ted text<br/>a girl he barely knows
that he sometimes has gay dreams<br/>about me?
Slow your roll.
You?
He's clearly talking about me.
Dude, it's me.<br/>I'm his best friend.
Okay, one:<br/>That has never been proven.
Two:<br/>If anyone were to have gay dreams
about one of us, it would be me.
I mean, look at me.<br/>Now look at you.
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old<br/>wouldn't be into that mess.
Here's the thing, Barney.<br/>I'm snuggly. You're not.
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next
to this business<br/>on a Sunday morning?
Wrapped in a comforter,<br/>and it's raining outside,
and there's muffins warming in the oven.<br/>I'm cuddly, bitch.
Deal with it.
I work out every day.
If there is one thing<br/>we know about Ted,
it's that he likes a nice body.<br/>This body would rock his world.
Ted and I have a history.<br/>I know what he likes.
There are things I could do to him<br/>that would blow his mind...
- Why do we want to have sex with Ted?<br/>- I don't know. It's weird.
Crazy, right?
Ted's having gay dreams about me.
And by me, he means M-E,<br/>Marshall Eriksen,
star of Ted's gay dreams.
Who cares?
So Ted has gay dreams<br/>about one of you guys.
It's not like you found out<br/>he has three months to live.
That's like... shocking, right?
Look at this guy.
How's it going best friend<br/>of 12 years?
Well, it's kind of weird, but...
I had this crazy dream the other night.<br/>It's a little embarrassing.
You can tell us, Ted.<br/>This is a safe space.
Yeah, your feelings are<br/>perfectly natural, buddy.
Here's what happened.
And then I proceed<br/>to waste a half hour
of those bastards' lives,<br/>telling them about this dream
I had where I ate dinner with my top 5<br/>favorite architects throughout history.
And then, at the end of the meal,
Frank Gehry slides the check<br/>over to I.M. Pei, and he says,
"Buddy, tonight,<br/>your name is I.M. Paying."
Buckminster Fuller<br/>almost did a spit take.
And then I woke up.
So, that's it?
No other dreams?
Nothing confusing or erotic?
Okay, how about this? You know<br/>how at some point in the future,
- machines will rise up against us?<br/>- Sure.
So, the machines...<br/>they've killed everybody,
and all that's left
is you,
me,
and Barney.
Which one of us would you, like...
get with?
And...
why do I have<br/>to get with one of you?
The machines are forcing you.
They want to watch.<br/>That's just how they get down.
That's a tough one.<br/>I guess it would have to be...
Holly.
Robin told me what you guys did.
That's why I made up the gay<br/>dreams thing. Guys, this is Holly.
And I didn't wait your precious<br/>three days to call her.
I knew where she worked,<br/>so I tracked her down.
Let me ask you.<br/>Did I call you too soon?
I loved that he called me<br/>right away.
I found it very romantic.
And I don't sit around my apartment
reading architecture magazines<br/>in my old cheerleader uniform.
I do that completely naked.
So Holly and I<br/>are going out to dinner.
I'll meet you out front.
I'm sorry, buddy.<br/>We were just trying to help you.
And, also, it was really fun.
I don't need your help, okay?<br/>I can take care of myself.
And, yeah, maybe...<br/>maybe there are some girls
who wouldn't like it<br/>that I called them right away
or said things too soon,<br/>but guess what?
Those aren't the right girls for me.
Maybe the right girl is the one
who loves that I do those things<br/>because...
that's just who I am,<br/>and I'm not gonna change
because of some stupid<br/>Three Days Rule.
Holly spells her name with an "I".
So I had proven<br/>that the Three Days Rule was wrong,
and I was out to dinner<br/>with a pretty girl.
And until right now,<br/>I've never told anyone
the truth about what happened<br/>on that date.
That's so funny!<br/>I love indie music, too.
We should get married.
Just kidding.
Or am I?
Just kidding again.
That's it. We're totally going<br/>to Brazil together!
And I went to my doctor this morning,<br/>and he said it is all cleared up,
so I'm good to go.
I think I'm in love with you.
In the end, I didn't need<br/>to wait three days,
but Holly really, really did.
Like a lot of rules,<br/>there are times to follow them
and times to not.
But I will tell you this.
When I got your mother's number,
I called her right away.
Hey, fellas.
- Aren't you working?<br/>- Took the night off.
- That's great! We can all hang out!<br/>- Yeah. I can't. Got a date.
You ready, baby?
What the...?
Wait, wait. Couldn't you guys<br/>just stay here and do your date with us?
Yeah, it'll be fun!
Look, I'm laughing!<br/>It's fun here! You like magic?
Fellas, it's time we said good-bye.
I mean, we shared a very special<br/>afternoon together,
and that's something<br/>I will always cherish.
I'll never forget you guys.
- Do you know their names?<br/>- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?
No. That's Marshall.<br/>He's married to Lily.
Okay. You like chicken wings?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In May of 2009,<br/>I was on the verge of scoring
my first big client<br/>as an independent architect.
I was willing to do anything<br/>to make it happen.
Here's what we want, son.<br/>It's real simple.
We're opening a restaurant<br/>called Rib Town
and we want it to be shaped
like a cowboy hat.
Anything.
A cowboy hat?
That's brilliant.
I love it!
I mean, nothing says delicious<br/>like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.
I think I was born<br/>to design this building.
I just...
I see it.
I don't see it. I don't see it.<br/>I don't see it.
What's so good about it?
Up all night?
I told these guys<br/>I have a vision for this thing.
They want to see a pitch<br/>in a week and I got nothing.
- It's cute.<br/>- Cute?
I could be designing concert halls<br/>and bridges.
Bridges so beautiful<br/>they could be in museums.
And I could design those museums.
But what am I designing instead?<br/>What has my career come to?
A two-story Stetson<br/>with outdoor dining on the brim.
It's a sick cosmic joke.
The universe<br/>is conspiring against me.
You just need to get out of the house.<br/>Take a walk. Get a bagel.
Yeah, that'll solve everything.
I haven't slept for 34 hours,<br/>but a bagel is the answer.
A cinnamon raisin bagel<br/>with a little cream cheese.
That sounds pretty good,<br/>I'm going to get a bagel.
Bring an umbrella.<br/>It's supposed to rain,
according to Galoshes,<br/>our weather clown.
Your show has a clown<br/>who does the weather?
That's a little cheesy, no?
And what's that restaurant<br/>you're designing shaped like, Hoss?
Fine.<br/>You want me out of the house,
I'll get out of the house.
Can't wait to see what the universe<br/>has lined up for me out there.
Kids, I've been telling you<br/>the story of how I met your mother.
And while there's many things<br/>to learn from this story,
this may be the biggest.
The great moments of your life<br/>won't necessarily be the things you do.
They'll also be the things<br/>that happen to you.
I'm not saying you can't take action<br/>to affect the outcome of your life.
You have to take action,<br/>and you will.
But never forget that, on any day,
you could step out the front door<br/>and your whole life can change forever.
You see,<br/>the universe has a plan, kids,
and that plan is always in motion.
A butterfly flaps its wings...
and it starts to rain.
It's a scary thought.<br/>But it's also kind of wonderful.
All these little parts of the machine<br/>constantly working,
making sure that you end up<br/>exactly where you're supposed to be,
exactly when you're supposed<br/>to be there.
The right place...<br/>at the right time.
Sync by vNaru
Kids, it's a miracle<br/>that I ended up on that street corner.
Especially when you consider how easy<br/>it would have been not to end up there.
I mean, when I first<br/>stepped out of the apartment,
I almost went right instead of left.
Why didn't I go right?
To answer that,<br/>we have to go back a few days.
As you know, back then,<br/>your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.
Now Eunice here<br/>makes all of these purses herself.
They're hand embroidered<br/>with the world's finest silk.
And each one takes months to make.
I cannot emphasize<br/>how much work goes into...
Go to weather, you idiot.
Hey, everybody.
We got a high pressure system<br/>coming in from the west and...
On the plus side,<br/>I bought the cutest purse today.
So, wait, why did you throw up?
- You don't want to know.<br/>- Come on. Tell me.
I'm pregnant.
I will raise this child with you.<br/>You are not alone in this.
We can even get married if you want,<br/>but I still want to see other girls,
- it would've to be one of those kind...<br/>- God, stop it.
I'm not pregnant.<br/>It's food poisoning.
I ate something from this place,
and three hours later,<br/>I was spewing like an open hydrant.
- God. From where?<br/>- Well, that's a gross question.
No, where was the food from?
- I don't want to tell you.<br/>- What?
Go to YouTube. Put in<br/>"Robin Scherbatsky morning show vomit"
Robin, home so soon.
Someone already put it on YouTube?
Yeah... Someone.
So...<br/>Why you been throwing up? You pregnant?
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.
So, wait, why won't you tell me<br/>where you got food poisoning?
You love this place.<br/>If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.
- That makes sense.<br/>- Yeah.
Don't tell me.
Is it that Indian place where the cat<br/>jumps on all the tables?
I'm not saying.
- That Spanish place with baby's crib?<br/>- I'm not saying.
God, no.
Is it this place?<br/>Tell me, damn you!
- You really want to know?<br/>- Yes!
It's Schlegel's Bagels.
Why did you tell me that?
Schlegel's?<br/>Thanks a lot, Robin.
Now I'm gonna have to try to find<br/>another place in NY
that serves bagels.
So, you see, kids, if I had gone<br/>to Schlegel's Bagels as usual,
I would have taken a right.
I would have gotten a bagel...
gone home,<br/>worked on the old hat building,
and you kids<br/>might never have been born.
But I turned left instead, to go<br/>to my second-favorite bagel place
and the rest is history.
Of course, I stopped<br/>at that magazine stand on the way.
Why did I stop there?<br/>Here's why.
Bro's Life magazine.
Page 83.<br/>Check it.
"What your paintball gun says<br/>about your personality"?
Below that.
"That last five pounds:<br/>How to get her to lose them."
Above that.
Petra Petrova.
Bro's Life magazine's<br/>girl of the year for may.
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps<br/>and leopard panties,
straddling an ATV.
These magazines are so lame. I mean,<br/>she's probably airbrushed and enhanced.
- I have a date with her.<br/>- You are my hero! Are you serious?
- How do you have a date with her?<br/>- Not part of the story.
Ted, I have been waiting<br/>a long time to say this.
This girl is the one.
Of course she's the one.<br/>You have to marry those.
Her.
Marry?
I have something much,<br/>much more special in mind.
Petra here, if all goes well,
will be my...<br/>wait for it, two hundredth.
Sorry, I couldn't wait.<br/>It's all exciting.
Your two hundredth,<br/>as in "sex with"?
As in "sex with."
I request the highest of fives.
Not if I was wearing a HazMat suit.
200 is too many.
Right, 'cause there can be<br/>too many of something wonderful.
"Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.<br/>Let's not hit too many homers."
"Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make<br/>three Police Academy movies.
"America's laughed enough."
Who are these girls?
That was rhetorical.<br/>Don't show me the list.
199 satisfied customers.
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.
I'm having a celebratory soirée<br/>beforehand at MacLaren's.
Prepare a toast.<br/>Black tie optional, but preferred.
Gifts are, look, I would say<br/>unnecessary, but follow your heart.
200's too many.
- It's not too many.<br/>- It's too many!
- It's not too many.<br/>- Thank you.
No, don't get me wrong.
You're disgusting, and the cops should<br/>probably clamp a boot on your genitals,
but that number should be higher.
After Barney told me about all this,<br/>I crunched the numbers and,
well...
I had some charts made up.
Barney here<br/>hits on roughly 20 girls a week.
It's way more than 20.<br/>And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.
Let's say 20.<br/>So, 20 girls a week means
1,040 girls a year.
In Barney's 16 years<br/>of sexual activity,
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,
that is a success rate of...
a little over one percent.
That's a batting average of 12,
eight times worse than<br/>the career batting average of...
one-handed pitcher, that's right,
pitcher... Jim Abbott.
Jealous.
Jealous.
Hero.
Suspiciously quiet<br/>during this conversation
about number of sex partners. Hero.
It's the grand total.<br/>That's the only number that matters.
- Says who?<br/>- Matthew Panning,
the stud of Port Richmond<br/>Middle School.
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.
I bet you never<br/>even done it with a girl.
Neither have you.
How many times do I have<br/>to explain this?
I've done it with 100 girls.
They're seventh graders<br/>at my cousin's school on Long Island.
Well, you know what, Matthew?<br/>Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.
Yeah.<br/>Call me when that happens.
And call him I will.
I think he's gonna say it again<br/>really slow.
Call him...
I will.
You listed Gaby Allan twice,<br/>as 78 and 162.
What? Let me see.
Seventy...
Once. Oh, my God.
Wait a...<br/>I counted the same girl twice?
That means I'm only at one 198?
That only means that you're half<br/>a percent less gross than we thought.
I'm seducing<br/>a Czech supermodel in two hours.
I can't squander that on 199.
Petra has to be 200.
What are you gonna do? It's not<br/>like you're gonna find someone new
to have sex with<br/>in the next two hours.
Hi, millionaire astronaut.<br/>Want to come back to my place
- and see some moon shells?<br/>- Go away.
I just got back from my wife's grave.<br/>Put her in the ground a year ago today.
Man, I miss her.<br/>I sure could use some comfort.
You're creepy.
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?<br/>I just want to settle down
and have a gaggle<br/>of rug rats, like, right now.
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.
Knowing how important this is to me,<br/>do you think Lily would even consider...
- By the way, I would do all the work...<br/>- I will end your life.
Right.
Where'd Barney go?<br/>It's been over an hour.
You know,<br/>looking over the names on this list,
I'm not sensing a lot<br/>of ethnic diversity.
He should really look<br/>at that in himself.
All done.
199 down, one more to go.
You done with your drink?
There's the stuff.
What the hell happened to you?
So, there's this girl at my gym...
Pauline... she's been<br/>after me for some time.
- Why'd you wait until now?<br/>- She's not exactly my type.
Looking good, Pauline.
You are gonna rip it up
at the Women's Pumping Iron<br/>Classic in Sarasota this fall.
I was thinking about you and me
and if you're still interested...
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio!<br/>- Geez! Mommy!
Every inch of her
tasted like roast beef and creatine.
But I did it.
I did it and I still have 30 minutes<br/>before I'm supposed to meet Petra.
Robin, do you have<br/>any concealer handy?
I'd really like to cover up<br/>some bruises and razor burn.
- I hate to break this to you, but...<br/>- What?
Well, you did count<br/>Gaby Allan twice,
but... you also went<br/>from 138 to 138.
You used the same number twice.
Wait, so, that means...
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?
Congratulations!
No... That was supposed to be Petra!
Petra was supposed to be 200!
Gorgeous, feminine, "Doesn't wear<br/>a weight belt in bed," Petra!
Hey, come on.<br/>You made it to 200.
You should be proud.
You should be tested,<br/>but you should be proud.
Who cares if Pauline doesn't<br/>pose for bikini pictures in magazines?
Actually, she does.
She's gonna be in next week's<br/>issue of Muscle Sexxy.
And like many of the ladies<br/>in that magazine,
Sexxy has two X's and one Y.
And so, on my way to get a bagel,
I stopped at a newsstand<br/>for a full minute
to check out a picture<br/>of Barney's 200th.
If I hadn't done that,
I would've walked right<br/>by the newsstand,
cut down 77th and gotten to<br/>that corner a minute early.
I would've gotten the bagel,<br/>done some work,
and you kids might<br/>never have been born.
Now, why did I cut down 77th,
and give a dollar to the homeless guy?<br/>Here's why.
Back when Marshall first started working<br/>at Goliath National Bank...
Fran, I don't mean to bother you<br/>but I have a big presentation tomorrow
and it would really help if I could get<br/>like some charts and graphs made up.
- Could you help me with that?<br/>- This is the graphics department.
We can make as many graphs,<br/>as many charts in as many colors
on as many kinds<br/>of paper as you want.
We are gonna have some fun.
I've ranked the Presidents<br/>in order of how dirty their names sound.
One: Johnson.
Two: Bush.
Three: Harding.
Four: Polk.
This circle represents<br/>"People Who Are Breaking My Heart..."
and this circle represents
"People Who Are Shaking<br/>My Confidence Daily."
And where they overlap:
Cecilia.
This is a pie chart<br/>describing my favorite bars.
And this is a bar graph<br/>describing my favorite pies.
What's going on?
Enough with the charts.
And the graphs.
Really any visual<br/>representation of data.
I'm not an idiot.
I know how you guys feel<br/>about my charts and my graphs.
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart<br/>of your reaction to my charts.
Let's take a look.<br/>Yes, it is true,
since Cecelia,<br/>your interest in my charts
has been steadily dropping.
But based on recent trends,
I have also made...
A projection chart!
And look...<br/>huge spike in interest coming!
And this isn't just<br/>some dead cat bounce.
This is big sustainable growth<br/>over the long term.
You're a big sustainable growth.
So, I have prepared a few charts
to demonstrate how setting up<br/>a shell corporation in Bermuda
could help minimize<br/>our second quarter losses.
And save you all some jail time.
To begin with...
Could you just please excuse me?
- Mosbius Designs.<br/>- What the hell happened to my charts?
- We threw them away.<br/>- What?
That's how an intervention works.
You wouldn't stop using,<br/>so, we flushed your stash.
Come on, Ted!
I need my charts, man!
Just for today and then I promise<br/>I will never ever use charts again.
I'm under at lot of pressure here.<br/>I need my charts, Jack!
My God, you're doing charts at work?
They're for work, you idiot!<br/>I'm giving a big presentation right now
and if I don't have<br/>those charts I'm gonna get fired!
Crap.
Stay right there.<br/>I'll bring them to you.
Hurry up! I'll try to think<br/>of a way to stall them.
I'm sorry but there's been<br/>a little delay with the charts.
But we will get started<br/>in just a minute.
Fish are weird, right?
I mean what's up with fish?
Charts! Get your charts here!
Excuse me, Milt?<br/>I think those are my charts.
These charts?<br/>On my blanket?
That's also my blanket.<br/>We'll get to that later.
- But I really need these charts.<br/>- Good, 'cause they're for sale.
Fine, how much?
One million dollars.
- I'll give you five bucks.<br/>- A million dollars.
No one's gonna pay<br/>a million dollars for these charts!
One million dollars.
Okay, Milt, you win.
I'm gonna give you<br/>one million dollars.
Urinating...
The problem is, the ATM...
The alien time machine.
The alien time machine<br/>has a withdrawal limit.
So, here's what I'm gonna do.<br/>I'm gonna give you one dollar
a day
for a million days.
That's...
That's 2700 years.
Deal!
Sucker.
I'm sorry, is there a land bass<br/>I don't know about?
Let's get started.
And so, if I hadn't bought<br/>those charts back for Marshall,
I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th
to give Milt his daily dollar
and well, you know the rest.
So, there you have it, kids.<br/>There's a lot of little reasons
why the big things<br/>in our lives happen.
If I had known then where<br/>all those little things were leading me,
and how grateful<br/>I'd be to get there,
well, I probably<br/>would've done something
like this.
Because somehow, I ended up<br/>in the right place at the right time.
And, as a result,
my life would never be the same.
The next day, Uncle Barney<br/>finally confronted Matthew Panning,
the stud of Port Richmond<br/>Middle School.
So, Barney, great to hear<br/>from you after all this time.
- What's been going on?<br/>- I've had sex with 200 women.
God!
That's way too many.
I mean, that's just gross.
Have you sought counseling<br/>for sex addiction?
Because you're a prime candidate.
Have you sought counseling<br/>for I win you lose?
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls
you nailed in the seventh grade<br/>aren't so impressive.
100 girls?
Is that what this is about?<br/>Barney, I lied.
Sure you did.
I was 12... of course I was lying.
I didn't have a pet Ewok either.
Sure you didn't.
Your whole adult life<br/>has been built around...
something I lied about<br/>when I was 12?
Jealous?
Look, I gotta go pick<br/>my kids up at school.
It sounds like you got<br/>a lot of problems.
Good luck, I guess.
I'm awesome.
200.
Now what?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, Stella Zinman was the girl
I thought I'd spend<br/>the rest of my life with.
Until she left me at the altar,<br/>smashing my heart to smithereens.
So when I ran into her<br/>seven months later,
there was only one way<br/>to deal with her.
- Great to see you!<br/>- You, too.
And Tony!
What a nice surprise.
"What a nice surprise"?
No, a nice surprise would be
if a safe fell from 40 stories<br/>and smushed them both.
You didn't let them have it?
No, we had a nice friendly chat, then,<br/>they went their way and I went mine.
You blew it.<br/>He blew it, right?
- Well played, sir.<br/>- Bravo.
- What?<br/>- You see,
Ted played it cool, which is exactly<br/>what he should have done.
As a matter of fact,<br/>I'd say on a scale ranging from...
And I kept this sweater of yours...
and sometimes<br/>I just sit in the bathtub
for hours just,<br/>you know, just sniffing it.
... all the way to...
This is my new fiancée.
She's basically Stella,
except she's French<br/>and, as you can see,
she's got enormous cans.
Enchantée.
Enchanté.
I'd say you nailed it.
I'll do you one better.
You, sir, got Stella thinking.
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.<br/>Did I choose the wrong guy?"
Give it a week, you'll get her back.
And her front.
Did you just feel that?<br/>I think we just had a "what up" quake.
I don't want her back.
Or her front.<br/>I just want to move on.
And this was an important step<br/>towards that.
To moving on.
And you know, I really meant it.
But still, that night,<br/>my mind began to wander.
I made a terrible mistake.
I know.<br/>I'm a better person than you are.
You totally are.
Let's get back together,<br/>and have way more sex.
Deal!
Hello, Ted.
Sync by vNaru
No, come in. It's not weird at all.
I knew it was wrong<br/>to steal somebody's fiancée.
I mean, I grappled with it.<br/>I was up nights.
And not for the good reason.
Well, sometimes for the good reason.
I mean, Stella and I hadn't<br/>seen each other in five years,
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,<br/>it was just fast and furious.
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.<br/>You see this bald patch?
Anyway, we moved on.
Me, Lucy, Stella,<br/>we were gonna move to L.A.
I was gonna become a screenwriter.
Then we bumped into you,<br/>and you just looked so...
sad.
Sad? No.
I think what you're calling sad<br/>was actually
a jovial nonchalance.
You looked awful, okay?
Like a little dachshund puppy
with a bad back that's got<br/>to pull itself around on a cart.
Why are you here?
I know I can<br/>come across pretty tough,
but I can't bear to have hurt someone<br/>the way I hurt you.
I think fate put me on that corner<br/>to make this right.
Obviously, I can't fill that giant<br/>crater that Stella left in your heart.
- I've been dating. Like, a lot.<br/>- And then I heard you got fired.
I transitioned into small business<br/>ownership.
T's the backbone of the economy.
No, it's not.
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.
And I want to use that money<br/>to make this right with you.
Tony is rich?
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.
Tell me he wrote you
a big, fat check.
A check so big it doesn't take<br/>its shirt off when it goes swimming.
That is a big, fat check.
A check so big, if you had sex with it,<br/>you wouldn't tell your buddies.
That is a big, fat check.
A check so big that<br/>when you sit next to it on an airplane,
you find yourself wondering whether<br/>the check should have bought 2 seats.
- That...<br/>- Is a big, fat check!
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.<br/>- A job?
Every year, my family gives<br/>a lot of money to Columbia University,
so I got some pull.
How would you like to design...
My heart leapt into my throat.
A new library?<br/>A new student center?
... your very own curriculum<br/>as a professor of architecture.
No, thanks.
What do you mean,
"No, thanks"?
You would be a great professor, OK?
You are knowledgeable,
you're a good talker,
and when you need to,
you can grow<br/>a very handsome neck beard.
I'm not gonna be a professor.
Teaching is what you do<br/>when your career
has totally bottomed out<br/>and you need to pay the bills.
Small business owner.<br/>Backbone of the economy.
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?<br/>I'm gonna be just fine.
- New topic.<br/>- Okay, new topic.
I just got a $200<br/>speeding ticket today.
That sucks, dude.<br/>You couldn't talk your way out of it?
You can't.
I've done it.<br/>It was... what was it?
It was 1998.
So where's the fire?
There's no fire.
Actually, you know, there is a fire<br/>at this barbecue I'm headed to.
Nothing special.<br/>Burgers, ribs... brats.
Son, do you have any idea<br/>how dangerous it is to be...
- Did you say brats?<br/>- Yeah, brats.
My mom marinates them<br/>in Belgian beer for two days. No big.
Funny thing was, I could've sworn<br/>that one of those thick,
succulent, hickory-smoked brats<br/>had some writing on it.
Weird. What were you saying?
What did it say? The brat?
It said<br/>"Property of Minnesota State Trooper
"Jorgensen."
You a brat man,
Officer Jorgensen?
You going to this address?
Follow me and lean on the horn.<br/>We're gonna be running some reds.
Well, duh.
I would've done that, too,<br/>if I'd have been going to a barbecue.
Damn, I was.
See, it's all about<br/>sizing up your opponent.
I could tell that the officer<br/>was a brat man because,
well, he was out of breath<br/>just from walking to my car and...
he had mustard on his holster.
Manipulating an officer of the law<br/>with your sausage.
That is very hot.
You think I can't talk my way<br/>out of a ticket?
You think I can't talk my way<br/>out of a ticket?
I am Barney Stinson,<br/>master of manipulation.
If I can talk a stripper<br/>into paying me for a lap dance,
I think I can talk my way<br/>out of a ticket.
Challenge accept...<br/>wait for it.
I don't get it.
"Accep-Ted."
I get it now.
- What now?<br/>- You want to be an architect?
Great. Guy I went to private school<br/>with wants a new house built.
- Job's yours if you want it.<br/>- Tony, look, I don't need your help.
Here's what he's offering you.
That is a big, fat check.
Showtime.
- License and registration.<br/>- Of course, Officer. Right away.
Sir, this is a gift certificate<br/>for a custom-tailored Italian suit.
So, we done here?
375 dollars!
And he kept the gift certificates.
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him<br/>to short-sheet him on the crotch.
You are bad at this, dude.
Whatever, Robin.
Like you've ever talked<br/>your way out of a ticket.
Are you kidding me?<br/>Robin's a pretty girl.
Pretty girls don't get tickets.
I bet she's been pulled over tons<br/>of times, never once gotten one.
That is outrageous!
And factual.
License and re...
Honey.
Don't cry.
It's okay. No ticket for you.
Go a little slower next time, okay?
Thank you.
Excuse me.<br/>I think I left something in New Jersey.
How did your lunch go<br/>with the rich guy?
Well, it started off great.
I want to design a house
that celebrates the landscape<br/>without overpowering it.
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright<br/>designed Fallingwater in 1935...
Yes, that's all fine.<br/>I'm sure you'll do a great job.
What I'm really worried about<br/>is the basement.
- Specifically the laundry room.<br/>- The laundry room?
I require a laundry room<br/>of 15 feet by 15 feet,
stain-proof ceramic tile<br/>from floor to ceiling.
I'm a man who likes to do<br/>his own laundry, and sometimes,
it gets messy.
- Messy?<br/>- Messy.
Steel chains will dangle from<br/>the ceiling at a height of nine feet.
And that is<br/>where my laundry bags will hang
for three days<br/>and three nights before I...
clean them.
Ted, it kind of sounds like<br/>what this guy is asking you to design...
- It's a murder house.<br/>- It is. It's totally a murder house.
You know, as a martial artist,<br/>I'm trained to trust my instincts,
and my instincts are saying this...
feels very good.
The steak is so rare.
Right?
One final concern:
Soundproofing.
I tend to make a lot of racket<br/>when I launder.
I'll show you what I mean.
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,
and you tell me if you can hear me.
Does something feel off<br/>about this guy?
Off the hook!
Bro, you are nailing this.
- You can't design a murder house!<br/>- I'm not gonna design a murder house.
- You can't design a murder house!<br/>- I'm not!
Bring it.
Officer, please,<br/>my wife is about to have a baby!
- Her water just broke!<br/>- Where's your wife?
She took the other car.
This is Italian leather, so...
I... Oh, come...
I'm sorry<br/>about that murder house thing.
That was my bad.<br/>That's on me.
New plan.
You, my friend, are gonna build
the Statue of Liberty
a husband.
Now, I got some suction down<br/>at City Hall.
Stop it!
I don't want your help, okay?<br/>You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.<br/>- Why?
Because...
when you were with Stella,<br/>I know how much I missed her.
I can only imagine you feel<br/>the same way.
Let me put your mind at ease.
I don't want Stella back, okay?
She lied to me<br/>and left me at the altar.
What kind of person does that?
I'm better off without her.
She's all yours, buddy.
There you go.
Load off my mind.
And that was it. Tony left,
and I began to put this whole<br/>business far behind me.
Or so I thought.
Tony broke up with me.
Tony broke up with you?
He said it was<br/>because of something you said.
You got Tony to dump Stella?
I am very sorry,<br/>but I'm going to have to insist
that you bump this.
Let's talk out in the hall.
It'll be waiting.
So, why are you here?
Look, Ted, this is about<br/>seven months too late,
but here goes.
I've been in love with Tony<br/>since high school.
We dated for a long time,<br/>but then...
I got pregnant,<br/>and I guess for two 19-year-olds
it was just too much to handle,<br/>so we broke up.
And for a long time I just<br/>focused on being a mother.
I forgot about Tony.<br/>I forgot about...
the very idea of being in love.
And then you came along<br/>and reminded me.
And I loved you for that.
I loved you so much, in fact,<br/>that it was just...
shy of enough.
But I never stopped loving Tony.
Take him back, honey.<br/>He's sorry.
No, that's not...<br/>that's not what's happening.
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.
- It was good seeing you, Stella.<br/>- Can you talk to Tony?
What?
He'd listen to you.
You changed his mind.<br/>You could change it back.
I know it's an awful thing to ask...
Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.
I don't know what else to do, okay?
I love him.
You love him.
So what, you're-you're appealing<br/>to the romantic in me?
Is that your strategy?
Because that guy's gone.
You can't pull<br/>those strings anymore.
They're not attached<br/>to anything thanks to you.
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!<br/>- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!
Okay, you can do this.<br/>You can do this!
Oh, you can do this.
- License and regis...<br/>- License and registration.
Excuse me?
I can only assume you need a license<br/>to have a face that beautiful.
And that body?
I'm guessing something that<br/>explosive has to be registered
with the proper authorities.
Get out of the car.
Why, am I under arrest?
But you're about to be under me.
No. False.<br/>Did not happen.
That's a line from a porno.<br/>I've seen that porno.
Hell, I've made that porno.
When will you realize<br/>that the only difference
between my real life and a porno<br/>is my real life has better lighting?
You're lying.
I am not lying!
I swear on my mother.
I swear on Goliath National Bank.
I swear on my suits.
I...
am...
not...
lying.
He was lying.<br/>Here's what really happened.
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!<br/>- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!
Is there anything I can do<br/>to make this better?
It's me! It's Barney. It's me!<br/>I need your help! I'm in big trouble!
Slow down. What happened?
I'm guessing something<br/>that explosive hasto be registered
with the proper authorities.
- Get out of the car.<br/>- Why, am I under arrest?
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.<br/>You've had 15 moving violations
in the last three days.<br/>Get out of the car.
But no, my wife's having a baby!
- I have a sausage with your name on it!<br/>- Out of the car now!
I need you to come<br/>to Brazzaville, New Jersey
and bail me out.
I'm in the middle of something.
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea
of the kind of the hardened criminals<br/>they've got me in here with.
Are we gonna get<br/>our spray paint back?
Save me, Ted!
You want to do something for me?<br/>I need a ride to New Jersey.
You'll pay for tolls, right?
I'm kidding.
So Stella and I drove<br/>all the way out to New Jersey,
bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail
and drove all the way home.
By the way, how's<br/>that girl you've been seeing?
That super hot French chick<br/>with the big enormous boobs?
Oh, you mean Claudette?
She's... fine.
Man, she's the hottest girl<br/>you have ever been with, Ted.
Ever!
I'm so sorry again about everything.
- For what it's worth...<br/>- I'll talk to Tony.
Really?
I want you to be happy, Stella.
I'll talk to him.
And I did.
I don't remember what I said to him,<br/>but I guess I changed his mind
because the next day,
they flew to California.
Stella set up<br/>a new dermatology practice.
And against all odds, Tony found<br/>some success as a screenwriter.
His movie, The Wedding Bride,<br/>was a big hit.
But we'll get to that later.
But just tell me this.
Why Tony?
I mean, is it the money,<br/>the kung fu pajamas?
Like, what...<br/>what is it?
He's the one.
The one.
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,<br/>but, yeah.
I'm gonna say something<br/>out loud that I've been doing
a pretty good job of not<br/>saying out loud lately.
What you and Tony have...
What I thought for a second<br/>you and I had...
What I know that Marshall<br/>and Lily have...
I want that.
I do.
I keep waiting for it to happen<br/>and waiting for it to happen,
and...
I guess I'm just...
I'm tired of waiting.
And that is all I'm going<br/>to say on that subject.
I once talked my way<br/>out of a speeding ticket?
Really?
I was heading upstate<br/>to my parents' house
doing, like, 90 on this country road,<br/>and I got pulled over.
So this cop gets out of his car.
He kind of swaggers on over<br/>and he's, like,
"Young lady,<br/>I have been waiting for you all day."
So I looked up at him and I said,
"I'm so sorry, Officer.<br/>I got here as fast as I could."
For real?
It's an old joke.
I know that you're tired of waiting,
and you may have to wait<br/>a little while more,
but she's on her way, Ted.
And she's getting here<br/>as fast as she can.
She tracked me down two days<br/>later using a phone book.
And that's the last time I wrote<br/>my name in my undergarments.
You're back!
When you told me<br/>that peanut butter and jam joke,
I was completely disgusted.
But I was in the shower this morning<br/>and it popped into my head
and it actually made me laugh.
Peanut butter.
So I can see now<br/>how I may have overreacted.
Marshall's words, not mine.
It's good to see you again, Lily.
Thanks.
- So what have you been up to?<br/>- I'm going to an amnesia ward
with a bunch of photos<br/>of my children and a wedding ring.
I'm gonna find the hottest<br/>patient/my wife, and we are going...
Okay, so that's good<br/>enough for tonight.
I gotta ease back into this.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Every architect can point to that one<br/>design that changed their career.
For me, it was around the time<br/>of my 31st birthday.
It wasn't a museum or a concert hall<br/>or a skyscraper.
It was something else.
We're opening a restaurant called<br/>Rib Town, and we want it to be shaped...
Like a cowboy hat.
Look, I need the work.<br/>I don't have any other options.
- There's always that teaching job.<br/>- Yeah,
I didn't work this hard to be stuck<br/>in some crappy, dead-end teaching job.
- No offense, Lily.<br/>- I got peed on three times today.
No arguments here.
I just gotta nail this hat building so,<br/>I'll see you all in three days.
For the next three days, I worked harder<br/>than I'd ever worked in my life.
And I got... nowhere.
Hey, Ted, whatcha doing?
Designing a building shaped<br/>like a hat.
- Now a good time to chat?<br/>- No.
- So, what do you think of Robin?<br/>- I really need to get to work, so...
Great.<br/>Say you and I went suit-shopping,
and you happened upon<br/>a beautiful suit,
a beautiful Canadian suit.
Double-breasted.
You try it on, but it's not exactly<br/>the right fit for you.
So, you put it back.<br/>Then I try it on.
I don't really want
to take the same suit that you had<br/>your eye on, but at the same time,
I really like that suit.
Buy the suit, Barney.<br/>You clearly care about it.
Tell the suit how you feel.
But Ted, rember that<br/>that was your answer because...
The suit is Robin.
I know!
Right?
I'm with you, buddy.
You are now.
- Because I explained it to you.<br/>- What do you talk...
Sync by vNaru
Come on, dude, you've been at this<br/>for three days without a break.
It's your birthday. Come up to the roof<br/>and have a beer with me.
No can do.<br/>Presentation is tomorrow.
Hat buildings<br/>don't design themselves.
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.
Just make sure the doors are wide<br/>and the chairs are reinforced.
Now, birthday beer on the roof.<br/>Let's go!
Why do you want me to come up<br/>to the roof so bad?
- Are you throwing me a surprise party?<br/>- What?
Ted, we threw you<br/>a surprise party last year.
Okay, you don't get<br/>two surprise parties in a row.
The fact that anyone showed up<br/>at the first one was surprise enough.
Right?<br/>Two surprise parties in a row!
That is rich!
That is rich!
Classic!
Classic...<br/>He still won't come up.
Come on. What the crap?!
I knew having a second surprise party<br/>was a bad idea.
Yes, Robin, I know.<br/>This party is...
it's... it's a disaster.
It was my idea.<br/>I take responsibility.
And there's really only one thing<br/>to do about it.
- Marshall, no.<br/>- Lily, I have to do this!
No point in putting it off<br/>any longer.
I should explain.<br/>You see, a few years earlier...
Forget it.<br/>This is so not pimped out.
If anything, this is pimped in.
You know who knows how to live?<br/>Those people.
The rooftop patio<br/>one building over from ours.
Across a chasm of just six or seven feet<br/>awaited a landscaped paradise.
And best of all...
That looks to be one...
... hot...
tub.
Great. How do we get over there?
What are we gonna do? Jump?
I can jump that far.
Marshall, lately it takes you<br/>two tries to get off the sofa.
You can't jump that far.
- Really?<br/>- Really.
Watch me.
But he didn't jump.
This actually is kind of nice.
Right? Right?
And in the years that followed,<br/>he kept almost jumping.
But each time, without fail...
Here we go.
He didn't jump.
But don't worry.<br/>'Cause if I can make this jump tonight,
it's totally gonna save the party.
Honey, please get down from there.
When Evel Knievel sat astride<br/>his star-spangled rocket
on the rim of Snake River Canyon,
do you think his wife said,<br/>"Honey, get down from there"?
For the last time,<br/>I am not Linda Knievel!
I will never be Linda Knievel!
You don't need to remind me.
Marshall, please don't do this.<br/>Please don't jump.
I'm sorry, Lily,<br/>but I gotta do this.
- You can't do this.<br/>- Why?
You want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, really?!
Lily, I mean, I noticed<br/>that you gained some weight lately...
I was lying, you jerk!
Go ahead and jump.<br/>I hope you die!
That's all the permission I need.
Listen, Robin...
- There's something I have to tell you.<br/>- But wait.
Before you do,<br/>I have to tell you something first.
What is it?
I think I'm in love with you.
It's Ted.<br/>Everybody!
- Hey, Ted, what's up?<br/>- It's here, Lily.
It's looking at me.
- What is?<br/>- The goat.
Now, I've told you some of the story<br/>of the goat already.
How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer<br/>to come talk to her class,
and how he brought a goat,
and how he told the whole class<br/>what he was gonna do
to the goat later that day.
And how Aunt Lily,<br/>in a fit of mercy,
bought the goat off the guy<br/>in order to commute its sentence.
Something amazing has happened.
I was talking to Robin,<br/>I was all set to tell her how I feel,
but before I could,<br/>you'll never believe what she said.
I think I'm in love with you.
- What did you say?!<br/>- What do you think I said?
What would anyone say<br/>to something like that?
Robin, listen.
You're great.
I mean, you're really awesome,<br/>but I mean, we're friends.
It's probably a bad idea.
I guess you're right.
Have a good party.
You too, kiddo.
- What?!<br/>- It's like, as soon as she said that,
no more feelings.<br/>I'm not in love with her anymore.
So, you've been in love with this girl<br/>for the past year,
and the second<br/>she reciprocates those feelings,
just like that, you're over her.
How great is that?!
This is a washcloth.
Not food.
What the...?
This is it.
Here...
we... go!
This is it.
Tracey, Tracey,<br/>tell Lily what you just told me.
- That I just moved to New York?<br/>- No, no, but tell her how you got here.
I just got off the bus from Iowa.
I just got off the bus from Iowa!
How lucky is it that an aspiring
dancer
just off the bus from Iowa runs into
the producer of the Rockettes?
I feel like I'm in one of those<br/>classic show biz stories.
Honey, you are.<br/>You really are.
Tracey, why don't you make me<br/>one of those rum and beers
- that your dad loves so much?<br/>- Sure thing!
- Damn it.<br/>- What?
Everybody always says,<br/>"Don't tell Lily."
"Lily can't keep a secret."<br/>And, usually, they're right.
But this time, I kept the secret.
And then you come along<br/>with this crap
and you force me to pull<br/>an old classic Lily and spill the beans!
What beans?<br/>There's beans?
There's beans.
The suit is Robin.
I know!
Right?
I'm with you, buddy.
You are now.
- Because I explained it to you.<br/>- What do you talk...
There you go.
Crap.
- He said that?<br/>- Oh, my God!
What a tremendous<br/>ground-breaking surprise!
- How long have you known?<br/>- 8 months.
And you've kept it a secret since then?<br/>Good for you.
Good for you, Lily.
I mean, what a bombshell.<br/>Who saw that coming?
- How long have you known?<br/>- Seven months, 29 days.
God, what am I going to do?
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to marry Barney<br/>in a big church wedding.
We're going to move<br/>to some sleepy New Hampshire town
and open a bed-and-breakfast.
- Really?<br/>- No!
It's Barney.
I mean...
it's Barney.
But it's Barney.
I got to tell him no.
Oh, man, you're going<br/>to break his...
Whatever it is that pumps<br/>that black sludge through his veins.
Crap. You're right.
The first time Barney<br/>expresses feelings for a girl
and she rejects him?
And not just any girl. I mean...
It will destroy him.
Okay, well, first of all...
Second of all,<br/>there is a maneuver you can try.
It's high-risk,<br/>but it's also high-reward.
For lack of a better term,<br/>I'm going to call it...
- The Mosby.<br/>- The Mosby?
No, she couldn't Mosby him.
- She could Mosby the crap out of him.<br/>- What's the Mosby?
Robin, you remember<br/>your first date with Ted?
You wanted to hop on the T-train<br/>and take a ride downtown.
I was ready to jump that turnstile.
What changed all that?
I think I'm in love with you.
What?
The Mosby!
- That is genius.<br/>- Thank you.
And...
excuse me.
I mean, you're very pretty,<br/>but you're freakishly tall,
and you don't believe in ghosts.
So, when she said she thinks<br/>she's in love with me,
she meant the opposite.
Exactly.
And look how well it worked.<br/>You're back to normal.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And it is great.<br/>It's awesome.
- So, Robin's not in love with me.<br/>- Nope.
Why not?
Mr. Goat?
Mr. Goat?
That's it.
Stupid goat.
I do not understand your<br/>fascination with this washcloth.
I guess that's what happens<br/>when you have a brain the size of a...
Marshall, can you just go get Ted?
Lily, I was just about to jump.
Didn't you hear me saying "Okay"<br/>over and over again?
Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>Go ahead and jump.
No, it's fine.
Sorry, everybody.
Lily won't let me jump.
Thank God.
Hospital!
What happened exactly?
What happened is<br/>you let a freaking wild animal
into our apartment.
I was savaged.
That is the sweetest, cutest<br/>little goat in the whole world.
Sweetest, cutest little goat<br/>in the whole world?
I was pretty sleep-deprived<br/>at this point,
so this probably isn't<br/>how it really happened,
but here's how I rember it.
So, you're the guy who tried<br/>to make it with a goat?
If anything, that goat<br/>tried to make it with me.
- Can I go, please?<br/>- Sure, you can go.
But remember, buddy,<br/>"baa" means "baa."
Great. Great. Now I'm going to be late<br/>for my presentation.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Goat.
Mr. Goat? Ted, that goat's a girl.
- Her name's Missy.<br/>- You got beat up by a girl.
So.
- You're in love with me.<br/>- What? Yeah. Very much.
Okay, you can knock it off.<br/>Lily told me.
Damn it.
I can't believe you would do that.
It's just...
Like, I care about you, Barney.
And...
This kind of stuff,<br/>the emotional stuff?
It's not your thing.<br/>I thought I'd save you the trouble.
Maybe I don't want<br/>to be saved the trouble.
Maybe I want the trouble.
I haven't wanted the trouble<br/>in a long time.
But with you, the trouble<br/>doesn't seem so...
troubling.
I don't know.<br/>I thought...
I guess I thought<br/>you felt the same way.
Maybe I do.
I don't know.
I'm not exactly the biggest<br/>confronter of feelings.
I mean, clearly, there's<br/>something between us.
Maybe my head was saying,<br/>"Nip it in the bud"
because my heart was...
saying something else.
Look...
I have feelings for you, Barney.
Maybe I even love you.
This is going pretty fast,<br/>don't you think?
- What?<br/>- We have a good friendship going.
Why screw up a good thing?
Friends?
Friends.
My God. You just did it again.<br/>You just Mosby'd me.
- I did not.<br/>- You did. You little minx.
Okay, you're right.<br/>I did just Mosby you.
Why are you so afraid<br/>of giving this a chance?
Because I am scared<br/>of how much I like you.
This is a bad idea.
You're right.<br/>This is a mistake.
- Yes. No.<br/>- I love you.
- Let's be friends.<br/>- Friends, then.
- I love you.<br/>- Let's get married.
- No, you're smothering me.<br/>- Okay, forget it.
You know what?<br/>We can sort this out later.
- That sounds good.<br/>- That sounds good. Let's go.
It had been a long and crazy night,
but that morning, against all odds,
I made it to my presentation.
Here you have it, gentlemen.
Rib Town.
Right?
Right?
Ted, listen. You're great,
and you've done a real...
special job here,
and you're going to make<br/>some other restaurant
very happy someday,
but...
we have...
decided to go...
another direction here.
What?
Feast your eyes on...
Rib Town!
Sven.
I'll tell you one thing.<br/>I'm never eating ribs again.
Yeah, right.
I am never...
eating ribs...
again!
In front of Ted!
This is a disaster.
How am I going<br/>to come back from this?
Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want<br/>to come back from this?
- What's that supposed to mean?<br/>- Architecture is killing you, Ted,
and it's killing us to watch it<br/>killing you.
You're like that goat<br/>with the washcloth.
You want it so bad,
and every time the world tries<br/>to take it away from you,
you keep grabbing it.
But you know what?
It's just a washcloth.<br/>Why do you even want it?
Because I have to be an architect.
That's...
That's the plan.
Screw the plan.<br/>I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being<br/>an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on<br/>being a TV reporter.
I am a TV reporter.
I'm on every morning at 4:00 a.m.
Is that still on?
Good for you.
Somebody watch it, please.
Barney planned on being a violinist.
Don't tell me things.
You can't design your life<br/>like a building.
It doesn't work that way.
You just have to live it,<br/>and it will design itself.
So, what, I should just do nothing?
Listen to what the world<br/>is telling you to do
and take the leap.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I love you, Lily.
Metaphorical leap.
Metaphorical leap!
- Not cool.<br/>- Don't do it.
Not cool.
- I did it!<br/>- Baby, you did it.
- I can do anything!<br/>- Yes, you can.
I'm getting a motorcycle!
You absolutely are not!
Okay, sorry.<br/>Guys, come on over.
That was the year<br/>I got left at the altar.
It was the year I got knocked out<br/>by a crazy bartender.
The year I got fired.
The year I got beat up by a goat.
A girl goat, at that.
And damn it if it wasn't<br/>the best year of my life.
Because, if any one of those things<br/>hadn't happened,
I never would have ended up and turned<br/>out to be the best job I ever had.
But more importantly,
I wouldn't have met your mother,
because, as you know...
she was in that class.
Of course, that story<br/>is only just beginning.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, on my first day<br/>as a college professor,
there were two things<br/>I didn't know
that I wish I did.
The first thing was that your<br/>mother was in that classroom.
The second thing?
Well, to explain that<br/>we have to go back
to the beginning of the summer.
When, after a year of wrestling
with their feelings<br/>for each other,
Barney and Robin<br/>finally, well...
Whoo!<br/>Lily, volume.
Use your indoor "whoo."
Sorry, whoo!
It's just, they kissed!
They're finally a couple.
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is our first double date!
First of millions!
What if our kids get married?!
Oh, I love this!
Yeah... Lily, listen.
Barney's awesome.
Robin is more than<br/>just awe- "some."
She's a... "quite a bit."
She's a... "a whole darn lot."
Wait, what are you saying?
We're just not<br/>feeling it right now.
But we'll totally still<br/>be friends. Oh, yeah.
Is it something I did?
Oh, no, no, no, no, God, no. No, no, no.
Uh-uh.<br/>Lily, it's not you.
I-it, it's us.<br/>Yeah.
It's us.
You understand, right?
Sure, of course.
As long as you're happy,<br/>I'm happy.
We were gonna take<br/>cooking lessons together
and we were gonna go<br/>on camping trips together
and then we were gonna sit<br/>around telling funny stories
about our cooking lessons<br/>and our camping trips.
I know, I know.
Until all of a sudden,<br/>it was the Friday
before my first day<br/>as a college professor.
Whoa, what's this?<br/>Oh, boy.
It's just a little something<br/>that we got for you
that used to belong to my<br/>favorite professor of all time.
A fedora.
I'm Indiana Jones... I'm Indiana Jones!
That, my friend,<br/>is the Dominator 8000,
the best bullwhip on the market,<br/>according to my whip guy.
Yeah, I have a whip guy.
You know what we should do?<br/>We should...
...Finish our drinks, go out<br/>in the alley, and whip stuff.
God, you just get me.
Okay, I should get going.<br/>I got a date.
Oh, are you still<br/>seeing that guy?
Uh, even better,<br/>seeing him naked.
What!<br/>Oh!
I should go, too.
I hooked up with this<br/>Chinese girl last night,
and I don't know, it's weird.<br/>I already feel like seconds.
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!
All right.
Hey, dummy.
What did tell you<br/>about smoking in here?
Make him whip the habit!
I'so excited about this whip!
I got whip fever!
Just whip him, Ted!
Don't even aim!
Just whip him!
I am so sorry.
No, it's just the whip's<br/>not a toy, Ted.
There's such a thing<br/>as common sense, you know.
Hey, you can whip me<br/>if you want.
I will, some other time.
Whoo!
Sync by vNaru
So, how long has<br/>this been going on?
All summer.
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!
You guys are boyfriend<br/>and girlfriend.
Whoa, hey.<br/>Whoa.
Wow, no.<br/>Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Lily.<br/>Girlfriend?
Slow your roll there,<br/>Lilypad. Yeah, yeah.
You've been together all summer.<br/>I dot get it.
Okay, it's like this.
After we kissed,<br/>we sat down to have The Talk.
We should figure out<br/>what this is.
Yes, we should.
Or...
Or...
Okay, now, we have<br/>to figure this out.
Yes, we do.
Or. Or...
Whoa!
We kept trying to have the talk
and then we realized<br/>we hate the talk.
Yeah, the talk sucks.
You have to, like, talk.
And be all, "I don't know.
"It's not that<br/>I don't like you.
"It's just that I haven't<br/>had a girlfriend
"in a really long time.
I hope that doesn't<br/>make you mad."
Who needs it?
You needs it.
Guys, you can't
just keep hooking up
and not at least<br/>try and figure out
what you mean to each other.
Yeah, we knew<br/>you would say that.
That's why we kept it a secret.
We, that and the fact
that elaborate lies<br/>really turn us on.
No, no, no. No.
You need to define<br/>the relationship.
You need to have the talk.
Or. Or..
I know what you're all thinking.
"Who's this cool peer of mine<br/>up in front the class?"
Well, I know the board says
"Professor Mosby," but to you
I'm Ted, huh?
Question. Awesome.
Hit it.<br/>Yeah, here's my question.
"Ted," who the hell<br/>do you think you are?
Yeah, "Ted."
We're supposed to learn<br/>from you?
You failed as an architect.
Well...
And if you're a professor,
where's your hat and your whip?
They're at home.<br/>I didn't think I'd need...
And where are your pants?
Oh!
Oh, God.
Barney, it was awful.<br/>I was teaching...
Shh, Ted, now's<br/>not a good time.
Whe do you keep your condoms?
I'm freeking out, I don't<br/>think I can do this
Okay, look, mistake #1
was taking that<br/>girl's question.
You don't take questions<br/>on the first day.
It shows weakness.
Mistake #2
was you should've hit that.
Dude, your pants<br/>were already off,
you had a classroom full<br/>of people to cheer you on,
and you can't knock her up<br/>'cause it's a dream.
Class dismissed.
Mistake #3:<br/>Dude, where was the hat?
Because if you're not gonna<br/>wear it I'm taking it back.
I think what Barney's<br/>saying is that
definitions are important.
You're their teacher,<br/>not their friend.
Exactly.
If people don't know their place,
nobody's happy.
Amen.
You have to make things clear.
Run tell dat.
Define the relationship.
Yes! No!
Lily, private convo time.
Lily, can't you just<br/>let us be happy?
You're not happy.
You just think you're happy<br/>because you feel happy.
And that's not happy?
Of course not.
You and Robin need<br/>to have the talk.
Why? Give me one good reason.<br/>I'll give you 20...
Wow, you can't even<br/>think of one.
Headlights. Deer.
Lily, for the last time,
things with me and Robin are<br/>as good as they can possibly be.
Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
I've got two tickets
to the Rangers/Canucks game<br/>tomorrow night.
I know you're a hockey fan,<br/>so I was thinkin'...
Uh, oh, um...
Uh...
What do I have to do?
Put a gun to your head?
Buy you a six pack?
Oh, come on, Brad, that's...
Wow, there's really<br/>six of them.
Uh, but... Uh, I can't.
Why not?<br/>You have a boyfriend?
No. No, no boyfriend.
Great! It's a date.
Hey, Barn.<br/>Hey, Brad...
I just thought of a reason
The next night, Robin and Brad<br/>went to a hockey game.
You're probably wondering<br/>why I've been quiet all night.
Um...
Damn it, Hordichuk!
You miss another gimme<br/>like that,
I'm gonna come down there
and put a slapper right up<br/>ur beerhole! Come on!
Not really.
The truth is,
I- I feel kind of weird<br/>being out with you.
Oh, man.
Is this the talk?
What?<br/>No, this is good.
Let's get it all<br/>out of the way.
Robin, I'm looking<br/>for something serious.
No, Brad, no, it's...
But before we go any further,<br/>you should know something
about my stuff below the belt.
I was born a little different.
God, no, uh,
Brad, no, um...
This I-is about me and<br/>Barney.<br/>You and Barn...
Oh, oh, so you, you guys are...
Well, we-we-we don't<br/>know what we are.
I mean, my heart says<br/>"leap into it."
My brain says<br/>"it's a bad idea."
Sounds like you guys<br/>need to have the talk.
We're not gonna have the talk!
Would you just<br/>have the talk, okay?
It's a five-minute conversation,
and then you get<br/>to have sex afterwards.
It's great! Back me up, Ted.
I don't think<br/>the talk is necessary.
What?!<br/>Thank you, Ted.
Because Robin is already<br/>his girlfriend.
What?!
MacLaren's Bar,<br/>four years ago...
How do you keep a girl<br/>from becoming your girlfriend
Simple: the rules for girls
are the same as the rules for gremlins
"Gremlins"?
Gremlins. Rule #1:
Never get them wet.
In other words, don't let her<br/>take a shower at your place.
♪2: keep them away<br/>from sunlight...
i. e. don't ever see them<br/>during the day.
And rule #3:<br/>Never feed them after midnight.
Meaning she doesn't sleep over
and you don't have breakfast<br/>with her. Ever.
What about brunch?<br/>Is brunch cool?
No, Ted.<br/>Brunch is not cool.
Ok, new topic.
How do I pick a tie?
Simple: remember<br/>in the movie Predator...
I've done all three<br/>of those things with Robin.
Is she my girlfriend?
Just once, I wish you guys<br/>would call me on Tuxedo Night.
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>time to pucker up
for the New York Rangers<br/>Kiss Cam!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Okay, how about this?
If you kiss me and you<br/>feel bad about it,
you're meant to be with Barney.
Why not? Lay it on me.
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!<br/>Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Hey, Brad.
Brad, we can't fight<br/>like this all night!
We both got some good shots in.<br/>Let's call a truce!
It's okay, dude.
I shouldn't go kissing<br/>some other guy's girlfriend.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>whoa, girlfriend?
He come on.
That's putting it<br/>a bit strongly.
A bit strongly. She's no<br/>Okay, yeah.
A gifriend's<br/>a bit much, Brad, okay?
Okay, seriously.
We're at the point<br/>of physical violence.
Now, will you please<br/>have the talk?
Because of that?
Come on. That's my thing.
I'm always punching guys.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Girls- I'll punch a baby.<br/>I don't care.
Finally, my first class<br/>had arrived.
For real this time.
I knew I had to make<br/>a strong impression.
I had thought of everything.
Except...
Wait. Does professor<br/>have one "F" or two?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Professor.
Pro-fess-or.
They're all staring at me.
Professor.<br/>Uh, I don't know.
Just do something!
Two "F's."<br/>That looks right.
I think that's right.
Hey, sorry I went little<br/>too far last night.
Oh, look, we've been over this.
Unless I say "flugelhorn,"<br/>you haven't gone too far.
No, I meant punching Brad.
Oh, right. Look,<br/>don't even worry about it.
It's... oh. God.
The doorknob's broken off.
We're locked in here.
Did, did you do this?<br/>No.
Flugelhorn.<br/>Did you do this?
No.
Ted? Ted, are you out there?
Ted's not here, Robin.
Lily, let us out of here.
I'd be glad to.
Just as soon as you<br/>and Barney have the talk.
Lily! Come on.<br/>Let us out!
No. Sit down,
define the relationship,<br/>write down
that definition<br/>on a piece of paper,
slip it under the door,
and if I like what I read,<br/>you can go.
We are not having the talk!
Then you'll die in there.
You're gonna lock us in here?
Well, guess what?
Maybe we'll spend<br/>the whole day having sex!
Well, guess what?
I brought Marshall with me,<br/>so maybe we'll do the same.
Hey, guys.
I still hadn't decided
what kind of professor<br/>I wanted to be-
authoritative or cool guy.
I thought I would decide<br/>in the moment.
And I did. About 20 times.
Good morning.
'Sup, dudes?
Silence!
This is Architecture 101.
I am Professor Mosby.
But you can call me Ted.
Professor Mosby.
T- Dawg.
Do not call me T-Dawg.
Never take questions<br/>on the first day.
It shows weakness.
Also,
don't look right here.
Okay, good luck. Byesies.
This was it:<br/>My crossroads moment.
What kind of professor<br/>was I gonna be
I had to decide.
Please save all your qstions<br/>until the end of the lecture.
Thank you!
Now...
Professor Mosby had arrived.
Of course, if I had taken<br/>that girl's question-
who, by the way, was not your mom
Your mom was sitting...
Wait, let me finish this real quick.
Here's what<br/>that girl wod have said.
I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby
but this isn't Architecture 101.
This is Economics 305.
You're in the wrong classroom.
Yes, I was<br/>in the wrong classroom.
And thus began
the most humiliating<br/>seven minutes of my life.
Here's your think-about-it<br/>for the day.
Every single person<br/>in this room
is already an architect.
Architect?
Hmm. Ooh.
"We're just hanging out."
Just hanging out?
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
Can anyone here tell me what<br/>this class is really all about?
Economics?
No. No, no. Don't laugh.
He's not...<br/>He's not entirely wrong.
An architect must be economical
in his use of space,
so, well done.
Looks like somone's building
towards an A, huh?
"We're seeing<br/>where things are going."
I'll tell you<br/>where things aren't going-
out of that bedroom.
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
You...
why do you want<br/>to be an architect?
I don't want to be an architect.
Yes. Yes, exactly.
It-It's not something
you want to be.
It's something you need to be.
You dot have a choice, right?
None of you has a choice
No questions!
"We're Barnman and Robin."
Oh, come on, you got to admit,<br/>that's kind of funny, Lily.
Not good enough.
Not good enough!
So if any of you
have even<br/>the slightest inclination
to do anything with your life<br/>other than become an architect,
you're wasting my time<br/>and yours.
There's the door
You can go.
I'm serious. Get out, now!
Whoa. Whoa.<br/>Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.<br/>Don't-Don't all leave!
Architecture's<br/>fun! Look!
I brought a hacky sack!
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.
My name is Professor Calzonetti.
This is Economics 305.
You may return to your seats.
Uh, sorry, sir.
This is, uh, Architecture 101.
Who invited their dad, right?
Young man,
for the last 28 years,
Economics 305 has been taught<br/>right here
in building 14, room 7.
Uh, yeah.
Buddy, I'm sure<br/>200 architecture students
and their professor<br/>all got the room wrong.
T- Dawg,<br/>you're in the wrong room, bro.
College kids, out of the way<br/>Sorry. Coming through.
Excuse me. Whoa.
20 minutes late<br/>on your first day?
That's rough.<br/>Mm.
Yeah, but here's<br/>the funny thing.
By that point,<br/>I didn't have time
to think about what kind<br/>of teacher I was going to be.
I just got up there<br/>and talked about architecture.
And it was kind of great.
That's awesome, Ted.<br/>Yeah.
Congratulations, buddy.
Thanks.
Nice job, Ted.
Hey, Ted, door five!
Were you there?<br/>Yeah, I got you, buddy.
They still haven't<br/>had the talk, huh?
I think I know<br/>how to speed things up
Oh, not cool!
Pancakes, fresh bacon.
It is so yummy.
Uh, dude,<br/>I'm starving. Let's...
Let's just have the stupid talk.
Come on.<br/>Fine.
But
how do these this even work?
What do we say?
Huh.
Where do you see this relationship going?
Oh, my God,<br/>that sounds so cheesy.
I know, right?
Totally. But, um,
where-where do you see<br/>this relationship going?
I don't know.
I mean,
it's not like I don't like you.
I just haven't had a girlfriend<br/>for a long time.
I hope<br/>that doesn't make you mad.
Mad?
I feel the same way.
I suck at relationships.
I mean,
except with Ted.
Man, he really got it right.
I know it's a cliche
but he really ruined me<br/>for other men.
Of course, I wasn't in the room<br/>for this conversation,
but I have to imagine<br/>Robin said something like that.
Maybe we should go back<br/>to being just friends.
Maybe.
But, um,
I don't want<br/>to stop having sex.
Oh, good. Me, neither.
Yeah. Friends<br/>isn't gonna work.
Nope. Oh, we're not good<br/>at being friends.
We're not good at being<br/>in a relationship.
Why are we good at?
I know something we're good at.
I don't know. If we're<br/>gonna do it again,
I'm gonna need<br/>some Gatorade, or...
No! No, not that.
Lying. Okay, think about it.
We spent the whole summer lying<br/>about being just friends.
Why not just keep lying?
Really?<br/>Yeah.
Really. We sat down.<br/>We had the talk.
Barney's my boyfriend now.
And Robin's my girlfriend.
I know it sounds nuts,<br/>but it feels good to say.
We're both afraid of commitment,<br/>but, the fact is,
we also can't live<br/>without each other.
And if the alternative<br/>is not being together,
then it's worth taking<br/>this risk 'cause...
...she's awesome.
And he's awesome.
He looks nice in a suit.
She can handle her Scotch.
He's my boyfriend.
And she's my girlfriend.
Oh!
Good enough!
She bought it.
Hook, line, and sinker.<br/>We are good.
Oh, totally. Mm.
So, you want<br/>to get some breakfast?
You know, brunch actuall<br/>does sound kind of good.
Hmm. Well, lead the way,<br/>sweetie pie.
Wow! Flugelhorn.
Yeah, that felt wrong.<br/>Mm.
Mm.
You do realize<br/>they were lying, right?
No, Ted.
They don't realize<br/>they weren't lying.
Oh, hello.
Hello. Good evening.
Hello. Don't get up.
Didn't we meet on a yacht?
Hello.
What?
Oh, no!
Did I not tell you guys<br/>that it was Tuxedo Night?
Doesn't feel<br/>very good, does it?

[<div class="full-script">This is the story<br/>of two blind dates. One in 2009,
and one seven years earlier.
In all that time, my dating routine<br/>remained more or less the same.
Until the fall of 2009,<br/>when I finally had a date that was different
because it was exactly the same.
I was on a blind date<br/>with the same woman
I went on a blind date with<br/>seven years earlier.
- Ted?<br/>- Jen?
It's nice to meet you.
And she didn't remember it.<br/>But then again...
It's nice to meet you, too.
Neither did I.
- Do you want to?<br/>- Yeah.
Sync by vNaru
Guess who just got four tickets to the<br/>Origins of Chewbacca Star Wars exhibit?
- Why?<br/>- No, I said, "Guess who?"
I heard you.
Yeah, isn't it a little early<br/>in our relationship
to do something<br/>that would end our relationship?
What? No, what are you talking about?
It can be our first double date as couples!
And plus, it sounds awesome!
Is the original Chewbacca<br/>going to be there?
Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?
Hey, do you think they'll have<br/>Wookiee-to-English dictionaries there?
I mean, even just an everyday phrase book<br/>would be helpful.
We're not going to the<br/>Origins of Chewbacca exhibit, Marshall.
It's in Houston this year.<br/>Everyone knows that.
I just wanted to get rid of the girls.
Where are you taking me, Barney?
This wasn't the first time your<br/>Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.
Wait a second. The Origins of Chewbacca<br/>exhibit's in Montreal this year.
Everyone knows that.
Where are you taking me?
My guy in the DA's office scored us<br/>front row seats to a lethal injection.
But we're still stopping<br/>for chili dogs first.
Stop the cab.
Where are you taking me?
Barney, why are we here?
Marshall, now that Robin<br/>and I are together,
I've learned a lot about relationships<br/>by watching you and Lily.
- Thanks, man.<br/>- You're a terrible couple.
Lily has taken all the man out of you.
I used to think<br/>that's just every relationship.
But what I've got with Robin proves<br/>that you can have a girlfriend
and fully functioning male genitalia<br/>all at the same time.
Okay, right.<br/>So, if Robin knew that you were here,
she would be completely fine with it?
Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here<br/>with a purse full of singles
and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show.
B t dub, I called ahead, it's lime.
Meanwhile, Jen and I were in<br/>my favorite first date restaurant
for the second time.
- So, Jen, what do you do?<br/>- I'm between jobs. Banking crisis.
I'm between jobs. Internet bubble burst.
Makes me realize I should go into<br/>something more stable, like banking.
- So, what about you?<br/>- I'm an architect.
Hopefully, one day,<br/>I can use my own humble brush
on the masterpiece that is<br/>Manhattan's skyline.
I teach architecture.
Get 50% off at the bookstore,<br/>so that's pretty sweet.
Married!
What is wrong with you?
You're just looking.<br/>It's like fantasizing about other women.
It's harmless. Wait.
Don't tell me you don't fantasize<br/>about other women.
I do!
- It's just not that easy.<br/>- False.
I once fantasized about that silhouette<br/>chick you see on a truck's mud flaps.
Took me less than a mile.
Not everyone is you, okay, Barney?
Even when I do start to have<br/>a dirty thought like that,
it seems so much like cheating on Lily,<br/>that I feel guilty.
So, first,<br/>I need to have a different fantasy.
Bad news.<br/>Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder
that's apparently medically legitimate.
What? How could this be?
Beats me, but it says it right here<br/>on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.
It's time, baby.
I will never love again.
No, Marshall, you must.
And after an appropriate number of years,
you should find someone else,
someone like that busty delivery girl<br/>from that one time,
and plow her like a cornfield.
And so, Marshall,<br/>to honor Lily, you must find
that busty delivery girl from that one time
and plow her like a cornfield.
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
This one's for you, Lil.
Where do I sign?
And then watch out, because it is on!
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Dude, Lily gets you in real life.
- She has no business in your fantasies.<br/>- It's all I know, okay?
- I can't help it.<br/>- I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen,
from this day forward,<br/>I will be the wingman of your mind.
Now, focus on the next dancer.<br/>Put Lily completely out of your mind.
Gentlemen,<br/>say hello to Jasmine.
Barney?
Is it just me or does that stripper<br/>look exactly like...
Ted, we found a stripper who looks<br/>exactly like Lily!
- Uh, yeah, I can't talk right now.<br/>- I'm speechless, too.
Everything's as perky<br/>as we've always imagined!
Stop looking at her.
Look, I gotta go.<br/>Take a picture.
Oh, I will.
But first, I'm going to make Marshall<br/>watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant
- between his wife's tatas.<br/>- I'll kill you!
- Sorry about that.<br/>- So, any thoughts on food?
Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
I would love to share the oysters.
Good. 'Cause if you didn't,<br/>that would be mighty shellfish.
Wow, that's bad.
That's why it's funny!
- We've been on this date before.<br/>- We've been on this date before.
We've been<br/>on this exact blind date before.
In this exact same restaurant.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I<br/>don't remember that date going that well.
Me, neither.
I remember thinking<br/>that you were a little snobby.
Wait, you dress your cats up<br/>in weird costumes.
They're not weird.<br/>See, you're being snobby again.
Oh, my God.<br/>Do you realize what this means?
Since our first date,<br/>we've done a complete lap
of all the single people in New York
only to end up back here, with each other.
Whoa.
We're going to die alone, aren't we?
Well, you've got your cats.
This is insane.
Wait, I gotta ask.<br/>Why did you think I was snobby?
Wait, okay, yeah,<br/>we were sitting over there.
"Main Lobster."<br/>They spelled Maine without the "e."
Good to know we're not getting<br/>the crappy understudy lobsters, right?
Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half<br/>lobster will be played by...
I get it, Ted.
Pointing out spelling errors in a menu<br/>makes you seem kind of snooty.
Huh.
I had no idea.
Okay, well, what about me?<br/>Aside from the cats,
how did I come across?
That's right, the check.
The check came and, of course,<br/>I was going to pay,
but you didn't do the check dance.
Guys want to wave the girl off<br/>and, you know, look like a big shot.
Huh.
I had no idea.
This is good. We're learning stuff.
You know what we should do?<br/>We should retrace the rest of that night
and figure out what else<br/>we do wrong on first dates.
'Cause let's be honest.<br/>We are scaring people off, Jen.
- We really are. Okay, I'm in.<br/>- Great.
Where'd we go next?
- I think we went to MacLaren's.<br/>- Okay.
Hey, I didn't really talk about<br/>my cats that much, did I?
And then, there's Tabby-Gail Adams,<br/>the jester of the group.
Tone down the kitty talk. Check.
You will not believe who we saw tonight.
- Dude...<br/>- We saw the third doppelganger!
I should explain. Over<br/>the years, we had spotted two strangers
who looked exactly<br/>like members of our group.
Hey, hey, hey!
Lesbian Robin.
And Mustache Marshall.
By the following summer, we would find<br/>the remaining two doppelgangers,
but I'll get to that.
Ladies, meet Stripper Lily.
Oh!
- Okay.<br/>- Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it,
but she looks just like you.
- So you went to a strip club?<br/>- Busted.
And there was a stripper<br/>who looked exactly like me?
Okay, babe, look, before you get mad,<br/>let me...
Awesome!<br/>I bet the guys were going crazy.
I bet they wanted to touch her so bad,<br/>but all you can do is look,
unless you go into the back room,<br/>but, honey, you gotta pay for that.
So, strip club.
Marshall made me go.
All right, so what did I do wrong next?<br/>Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
Well, I kept dropping hints that I was cold,<br/>but you didn't offer me your jacket.
- It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?<br/>- Not really.
Really? I can't feel my fingers.
I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
I couldn't admit I was cold.<br/>I didn't want to seem like a wimp
compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend<br/>who you wouldn't stop talking about.
After a day of fighting fires,
Jim would love to come home<br/>and unwind working on his '68 Camaro.
That or bare-knuckle boxing,<br/>which he learned in the Marine Corps.
I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.
Okay, so no talking about the ex.
Not even about his shockingly<br/>small wiener?
See? Why didn't you lead off with that?
Was there a shower on stage?<br/>Sometimes there's a shower on stage.
I bet stripper me would get in there<br/>with another girl and just go bananas.
See, Marshall?<br/>We got to have a bros' night at a strip club
and both of our ladies<br/>are totally cool with it.
I'm not cool with it.
Because they understand that it's healthy<br/>for us to do that from time to time.
- It's disgusting.<br/>- Because it's harmless.
Did one of your whores tell you that?
And, Lil, Marshall shouldn't have<br/>to go to so much trouble
just to have an innocent fantasy.
- Trouble? What trouble?<br/>- It's... No, it's nothing.
- Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.<br/>- No, we're not.
Lily, sometimes I think<br/>about other women. Okay, it happens.
But even when I do, I feel so guilty
that I...<br/>I have to imagine you passing away first
because even in a fantasy world,<br/>I could never cheat on you.
You're just my life, baby, and I love you.
You kill me off?
I mean,<br/>fantasize about other girls all you want,
but could you maybe not murder me?
Murder? No! I... Baby, no.<br/>You develop a chronic illness!
I spare no expense for your care!<br/>I even set up a foundation in your name.
We're, like, this close to a cure.
- Remember?<br/>- Oh, yeah! I do remember.
We went in here for a drink<br/>with your friends, who I loved.
Or hated, depending on whether<br/>you're still friends with them.
- You love them.<br/>- They're family, Ted.
Let's go in and see what they remember.
And they are my best friends,
so don't be surprised if they suddenly<br/>can't think of anything I do wrong.
Did he juggle? Bad puns?
Expect a standing ovation<br/>for picking up a $19 check?
Let's not forget the menu typo gold mine.
Keep panning that river, buddy.
Well, it is a lot cheaper<br/>than buying a condom.
Actually, you know what it was?
I remember him coming across<br/>as kind of a player.
- Me?<br/>- Ted?
Yeah. We were all sitting over there.
And here's a picture of my cats<br/>dressed up like Batman villains.
You got the Joker, the Riddler,<br/>Mr. Freeze...
Well, what about Catwoman?
Yeah, that would've been good.
Psst. Ted.
Nice.
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!<br/>I remember that.
I was not checking out a girl.
Psst. Ted.
Nice.
We were checking out<br/>Mustache Marshall.
Oh!
Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk.<br/>I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well, it's nice to know "past me"<br/>wasn't a total jackass, huh?
"Present you" isn't so bad, either.
- Thank you very much. Yes.<br/>- You got it?
Oh, yeah! I remember this.
And there's the Chrysler Building.<br/>And the Empire State Building.
And at twelve o' clock, a rotund couple<br/>going at it against the glass.
Oh!
That's kind of sweet.
Oh, look, snack break.
Good for them.
Letting a guy eat pizza off your back,<br/>that's love.
So, I know this wasn't<br/>the best first date of all time,
but I'm glad we stuck it out.
Me, too.
That was really great. What went wrong?
I remember now.
- Wow.<br/>- Yeah.
So, would you maybe<br/>want to go out again?
Yeah, I... I would.
- Will you call me?<br/>- Absolutely.
- Promise?<br/>- Promise.
I have been so busy.
Good night, Ted.
- Hello?<br/>- Jen, I'm sorry.
Look, I know I'm seven years late<br/>with this call,
but I was an idiot back then.
You saw the goatee.
The truth is, I had a great time tonight,<br/>and I'd love to see you again.
Ted, there are two kinds of guys.
The guys that you want to call you,<br/>who don't,
and the guys you don't want to call you,<br/>who always do.
And somehow, right now, you're both.
Baby, you should be able to fantasize<br/>about another woman
without feeling guilty, or, you know,<br/>killing me off.
I wish that I could,<br/>but I've been doing this for so long,
I'm all confused about death and sex.
It's gotten to the point<br/>where every time I drive past a cemetery,
I'm sporting a partial.
All right, we gotta fix this.
Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here,
you have my permission<br/>to fantasize about her.
And since she's basically me,<br/>maybe you won't feel guilty.
Thanks, baby. I'm so lucky to have you.<br/>And stripper you.
Bring out Stripper Lily!
You know, I don't come here that much.
Hey, Barney. Here's the usual
and I'll send over the other usual<br/>as soon as she's done stretching.
Thank you, kindly stranger.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Oh! Hey, Barney. I didn't see you come in.
I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together<br/>for (STAMMERING) Jasmine.
- I am hot!<br/>- Yeah.
Crawl for it, stripper me.<br/>This is awesome, baby.
- Can I get another $100?<br/>- That was $100?
Wow, she crawls fast.
Look, Jen, I wish I could go back<br/>and talk some sense into 2002 Ted,
but that guy's a lost cause.
He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair<br/>makes him look like Johnny Depp.
And he has no idea what a great girl<br/>he's missing out on.
But I've learned a lot since then.<br/>I've learned a lot tonight.
The only thing that we've learned is that
seven years ago,<br/>it was a mistake for us to go out.
And I guess it was a mistake<br/>for us to go out tonight.
No, it wasn't.
I had a great time tonight.<br/>And seven years ago,
if you think about it,<br/>we didn't miss by that much.
I mean, if a couple of things<br/>had gone a little bit differently,
who knows what would have happened?
Asking you to stay<br/>The words are finally here
Let's rewind and rewind
You see, you're the only star<br/>in the film I never made
Would you rewind it all the time<br/>Rewind it all the time
- Wow.<br/>- Wow.
You are the best, you are the best.
My girlfriend is at a strip club with me<br/>and she couldn't care less.
I do care, Barney.<br/>Look, we're dating now, okay?
That changes things.<br/>We need to have a serious talk about this.
- Just the best.<br/>- Hey, girlfriend trouble?
I wish I could help,<br/>but my unbelievably cool wife
just bought us a private dance<br/>with her stripper body double.
So, if you need me, I'll be getting grinded<br/>like some pepper in the champagne room.
Just the best.
Now what?
I just remembered why I didn't call you.
Why?
I can't believe<br/>I'm gonna screw this up again.
- But I like finding typos in menus.<br/>- What?
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid,<br/>but the truth is,
I'm not suddenly gonna stop<br/>making stupid jokes.
Now that you mention it,
I'm never going to stop talking<br/>about my cats.
They're funny and adorable and totally<br/>worth having to take six Benadryl a day.
Shouldn't we hold out for the person
who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks,<br/>but actually kind of likes them?
Even if it means finding ourselves<br/>on another blind date with each other
- seven years from now?<br/>- Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.
Well, good luck out there, Jen.
You, too, Ted.
You'll find your shellfish lady.
And kids, when I told<br/>your mother that shellfish joke,
she did laugh.
And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.
Hey, Lil. Looks like Jasmine's having<br/>a hard time getting out of those boots.
What did you say, buddy?
- Lily?<br/>- Who?
Oh, yes, I am this Lily.
We married long time.
May I have monies for shopping?
Lily!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">{\pos(192,210)}Kids, your uncle Barney had been called<br/>a lot of names over the years.
{\pos(192,210)}Jerk!
{\pos(192,210)}Bastard!
Barack Obama Jr.?!
And yes... We can.
But there's one name none of us<br/>ever expected to hear him called.
Boyfriend.
Barney Stinson is my boyfriend.
I've said it, like, a hundred times<br/>it still sounds weird to say.
Well, anything sounds weird<br/>if you say it a hundred times.
Bowl.
Bowl.
Bowl.
But other than that,<br/>things are good?
I don't know.
I think he's been<br/>single for too long.
The other night,<br/>I wake up at 4:00 a.m.
Are you awake?
This is not a one-night stand.<br/>We're dating. Come back to bed.
That's happened three times.<br/>It's not just that, it's other things.
What's wrong?
It was just one thing after another<br/>at work today, and then...
I found out my aunt's<br/>in the hospital.
I'm just, I'm feeling<br/>so overwhelmed and...
What you need to do<br/>is talk through this stuff.
Thanks.
And, once you're off the phone<br/>with Lily,
I'll be down in the bar<br/>ready to have sex.
Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est<br/>person in the world, but...
- A little more effort would be nice.<br/>- I understand.
I guess, in a lot of ways,<br/>Barney doesn't stack up.
I mean, you've had<br/>some pretty incredible boyfriends.
No, that's not it.<br/>I don't know.
Maybe he just<br/>doesn't have it in him.
Maybe this {\whole}thing's a big mistake.
- She really said that?<br/>- And she meant it.
Trust me. I dated Robin for a year.<br/>If you don't want to lose her,
you gotta try a little harder.
Be more attentive<br/>to where she is emotionally.
Just... be present.
- Yes, totally.<br/>- Yeah.
Only thing, and this is just me...
I like my testicles<br/>attached to my body,
rather than rolling around next<br/>to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.
Stinson out!
But then a funny thing happened.
Over the next couple weeks,<br/>Barney was thoughtful, considerate...
Sweet.
In short, the perfect boyfriend.
Which, to Robin,<br/>meant only one thing.
- He's cheating on me.<br/>- What?!
Why else would he buy me flowers?<br/>He's gettin' some on the side.
Come on, Barney's not the type of guy<br/>who would... Go on.
{\Plus, }He keeps saying he's working late.
When I call his office,<br/>they say he left hours ago.
- That doesn't prove anything.<br/>- Yes. Proof.
Good word.<br/>I'm glad you brought that up.
Barney's briefcase.<br/>He forgot it here this morning.
And what do you plan<br/>on doing with it?
We... You and I, are going to open it up<br/>and look for evidence.
Ted probably has a sledgehammer<br/>around here somewhere.
Stop! Stop! Eye contact.
Listen to me.<br/>Robin Scherbatsky is many things:
friend, confidant,
occasional guest star<br/>in some confusing dreams
that remind me a woman's sexuality<br/>is a moving target.
But she is no crazy,<br/>jealous stalker-bitch.
Let go.
I've been down in the basement<br/>storage area
going through the stuff that<br/>Lily and I left when we moved out.
Sorry. We should've<br/>cleared it out for you much sooner.
- There's a basement storage area?<br/>- You're not upset.
Good.<br/>Baby, guess what I found.
- That's great, honey.<br/>- What the hell is that?
Marshall got it in college.<br/>He used it as a nightstand for years.
Until we found out that Lily<br/>was allergic to barrel resin.
- Barrel resin?<br/>- Just go with it.
- So you need a hand throwing it out?<br/>- No, I'm not...
I'm not just going<br/>to throw her out, OK?
Mabel's like family.
So, what are you going<br/>to do with Mabel?
I want to give her away,<br/>to a lucky new owner.
- Do you know anyone?<br/>- Yeah, let me think.
Do I know any rodeo clowns?
That's weird, I do. But even Lenny<br/>wouldn't go near that mess.
{\Well, }He's not going to have the chance,<br/>because I am putting old Mabel
in the Bermuda triangle.
"The Bermuda triangle"<br/>was the name we'd given years earlier 
to the curb right<br/>in front of our building.
Whenever we wanted to give<br/>something away, we'd put it right there.
It was uncanny.
This is so exciting.
Right now there's some out there<br/>who has no idea that tonight
they're going home with just...
just the best barrel.
{\Well, }Let's just hope they're not allergic<br/>to barrel resin like Lily here.
Be cool, baby. Damn!
- See you, sweetie. Good luck.<br/>- Bye, babe.
- Now, can we please get out of here?<br/>- I'll grab my coat.
- A college notebook?!<br/>- Oh, my god, he's cheating on me
with some college girl.
I knew there was a skank,<br/>but I thought she'd at least be dumb.
"Birthday: July 23.
"Favorite hockey team:<br/>the Vancouver Canucks.
Age: 29, but tells<br/>people that she's 26."
Oh, my god,<br/>these are notes about me.
Or some 29-year-old version of me.
I hope I'm not too late! I want to see<br/>the look of joy on the new owner's face!
She's still there!
Okay Mabel, let's find<br/>you a new home.
Here comes a guy!
He just walked,<br/>walked right on by it.
He's probably rushing home<br/>to get a handcart or something.
Yeah!<br/>Better hurry up, pal.
What are you guys doing with Barney's<br/>secret Robin notebook?
Let me rephrase that.
Did you two ladies lose some weight?
What do you know about this?
Why would Barney have a notebook<br/>full of information about me?
Well...
The truth was...
Barney was taking a<br/>night school class...
... taught... by me.
Welcome to Robin 101.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Titou
.:: La Fabrique ::.
Why is Ted teaching<br/>a class about me?
It all started a few weeks ago.
{\pos(192,210)}... rather than rolling around next<br/>to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.
{\pos(192,210)}Stinson out!
{\pos(192,210)}Stinson back in.
{\pos(192,210)}Say, hypothetically, I did
{\pos(192,210)}want to change who I am to become<br/>a better boyfriend to Robin,
{\pos(192,210)}which I do not!
{\pos(192,220)}What kind of changes<br/>are we talking about?
{\pos(192,220)}Why, I mean, there's just so much<br/>you need to know about her.
{\pos(192,210)}Okay, for starters,
{\pos(192,210)}don't ever cry in front of her.
{\pos(192,210)}And whatever you do,
{\pos(192,210)}don't cry in front of her<br/>four times.
{\pos(192,180)}Hey, guys.<br/>What you talking about?
{\pos(192,180)}Fantasy football.
{\pos(192,210)}They realized they couldn't talk<br/>about this stuff at the bar,
{\pos(192,210)}and since you live with Ted,<br/>they had to find someplace safe.
{\pos(192,210)}So... Ted's classroom.
{\pos(192,220)}"How to date Robin Scherbatsky."
{\pos(192,210)}Lesson one.
{\pos(192,210)}Now, even though she puts up<br/>a tough exterior,
{\pos(192,210)}what Robin really wants,<br/>deep down...
- I'm bored.<br/>- You said you wanted my help.
Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?
- We did that already.<br/>- No, like, really big boobs.
{\pos(192,210)}No. Look, I need this, too.
{\pos(192,210)}I've only been a professor a few weeks.<br/>Being up here, it's,
{\pos(192,210)}- it's good practice for me.<br/>- Can we've class outside?
{\pos(192,210)}What Robin really<br/>wants deep down is...
{\pos(192,210)}- Barney!<br/>- What?
{\pos(192,210)}I'm tweeting about you.
{\pos(192,210)}You should be flattered.
{\pos(192,210)}How do you spell<br/>blah-blah-blah, "H'S" or no?
{\pos(192,210)}You were just, like, the worst student<br/>in the world, weren't you?
{\pos(192,210)}They said I had A, D... something.
{\pos(192,210)}Can we have class outside?
{\pos(192,210)}Barney, I'm only gonna<br/>say this once,
{\pos(192,210)}so listen up.
{\pos(192,190}I love you and I love Robin.<br/>And I want to make this work.
{\pos(192,210)}So if you give me<br/>a few weeks of attention,
{\pos(192,210)}I could give you<br/>a lifetime of happiness.
Can you do that for me?
Do you think I should get sports<br/>illustrated for 70% off the cover price?
Can we have class outside?
I got to find a way<br/>to reach this kid.
"Class number two."
"Top ten Robin Scherbatsky
facial expressions<br/>and their meaning."
Now, notice the vacant eyes,
the pale, queasy expression,<br/>suggesting nausea.
- What do these mean?<br/>- You guys just had sex?
Wasn't me.
Dude! I worked really hard<br/>on these slides, okay?
Can we just...
This look is hunger.
If you ever see her looking like this,<br/>get some food in her quick,
or one of two things will happen.<br/>One:
weird, out-of-context laughter.
Or two:
spontaneously falling<br/>asleep in strange places.
But...
the most important facial<br/>expression of all?
That's a building.
That's for my class.<br/>The Flatiron building.
Fun story about it.
It was designed by Chicago's<br/>Daniel Burnham
in the beaux arts style;<br/>this architectural gem was one...
- Dude!<br/>- Right.
The most important facial<br/>expression of all.
Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.
If you ever,
ever see this face, Barney,
run.
And don't take a picture of it.
She will punch you.
And you will cry...
for the third time...
that night.
Which brings us<br/>to an important point,
defusing the bomb.
"Defusing the bomb"?
What does that even mean?
"Three topics to distract Robin<br/>from being mad at you".
"Distract" me?<br/>That is so condescending.
These guys<br/>are really starting to piss me off!
"Immediately switch the conversation<br/>to one of the following,
"unless you want Robin<br/>to start throwing her shoes".
One:
"Vancouver Canucks<br/>2004 division title."
What?!<br/>That's not distracting.
That's just talking about the story<br/>of a scrappy little underdog team
that prevailed despite<br/>very shaky goaltending and, frankly,
the decling skills of Trevor Linden.
Two:
"Proper gun cleaning<br/>and maintenance".
You have to clean your gun.
My uncle had a filthy old shotgun,
blew his thumbs off<br/>trying to shoot a beaver.
You want to distract someone,
make them watch my uncle<br/>try to eat corn on the cob.
Three:
"Emperor penguins."
Did you know<br/>that before intercourse,
the male and female emperor penguins<br/>bow to each other?
Mr. Penguin.
Mrs. Penguin.
Oh, God,<br/>silly penguins acting all fancy.
What were we talking about?
Looks like we got a taker.
Come on, dude.
You know you want to.
A guy like you, beard, no mustache.
You're exactly the kind of guy<br/>who could use a sweet barrel.
Do it.
That's not a fire hydrant!
What...<br/>For shame, sir.
For shame!
I bet you couldn't even grow a mustache<br/>if you wanted to.
Neither can you{\, sweetie}.
{\Well, }He doesn't know that, baby!{\ God!}
Ted's only teaching Barney<br/>horrible things about me.
I don't know.
Check this out.<br/>This is {\actually }kind of sweet.
Now, we all know Robin's not<br/>what you'd call "touchy-feely."
She doesn't say "I love you"<br/>like a normal person.
Instead, she'll laugh,
shake her head,<br/>give you a little smile and say
"You're an idiot."
"You're an idiot"?
If she tells you you're an idiot,<br/>you're a lucky man.
And if she does say "I love you",<br/>she's already broken up {\with you }in her mind.
{\I think }It's nice<br/>that Ted knows you that well.
{\Well, }Too bad,<br/>it's next to a page entitled...
"Robin Scherbatsky's<br/>surprising erogenous zones."
Right knee,
ticklish.
Left knee...
Does lefty like that?
Lefty like that.
I can't believe<br/>I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby.
That's like taking fashion advice<br/>from...
Well, Ted Mosby.
Here's a good one.
"Top five things never to do<br/>around Robin".
Three:
"Never, ever,<br/>play the "Guess who?" game with her."
What do you mean?
Guess who?
It's me! It's me! It's me!
Four:
"unless you want to see it<br/>80 times a day, for the next month,
never show Robin a youtube clip
of an animal<br/>playing a musical instrument."
Barney!
- Do you have a problem with this class?<br/>- It's boring as hell
and I'm not learning anything.
Maybe the problem is your attitude.<br/>You're not listening to a word I say.
Can you hear this, professor?
Or should I turn it up for you?
It may not have been a thumbs-up,<br/>kids.
So, you think<br/>you're not learning anything?
Pop quiz.
When Robin's PMS-ing,<br/>what {\kind of }chocolate should you get her?
- Trick question. {\Get her }Butterscotch.<br/>- Correct! Why?
Butterscotch is to Canadian women<br/>what chocolate is to American women.
Correct!
{\What is }Robin's dream job?
To become the most successful<br/>female tv journalist{\of all time}.
Correct! And if she achieves that,<br/>will she truly be happy?
Robin's deep-seated need for attention<br/>can be traced
back to her father's<br/>emotional distance,
and no {\amount of }success will ever make up<br/>for what she truly needs,
which is six simple words from her dad:<br/>"Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?".
But I guess you're right.
You haven't learned anything.
Sorry to have wasted your time.
"O captain! My captain!".
How good was dead poet's society?
I know, right?<br/>The end? Tears.
Can I just say<br/>that my deepest need in life
is not to have my father to say<br/>"I am proud of you, eh?".
- Then why are you crying right now?<br/>- I'm not crying.
Sweetie.
Can I get you some butterscotch?
Stop it.
Wait a second.
It says here that the class meets<br/>at 6:15 on Tuesday.
- So?<br/>- That's right now.
Now, as you can see,<br/>well over 50% of the blankets
have been dragged onto her side.
Make no mistake.
Robin Scherbatsky is a classic,
textbook...
cover hog.
- Any questions?<br/>- I have one.
Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.
{\pos(192,220)}I got this.
{\pos(192,220)}So, emperor penguins,
{\pos(192,220)}Crazy!
{\pos(192,220)}What {\the hell }do you {\two }think you're doing?
Marshall, did you sell us out?
I was vulnerable.
I said good-bye<br/>to a very dear friend today.
Dude, it's a barrel!
You're giving Mabel away?
I have so many questions.
Why would you do this?<br/>What were you thinking?
Who the hell is that guy?
That's Shin-Ya.<br/>He's sort of been auditing the class.
"Auditing"?
{\Well, }I tried to explain<br/>{\to him }it wasn't a real class,
but I don't think he speaks {\much }english.
On the bright side,<br/>he came in handy standing in for you
during the role-playing exercises.
Wait, you did role-playing exercises<br/>where I was played by Shin-Ya?
{\You know, }I can't believe you, Ted.
You actually think<br/>you're {\some }kind of an expert on me?
He is an expert.<br/>He's a great teacher!
Kiss ass.
You know, half the stuff<br/>in this notebook is patently wrong.
Really?<br/>Name one wrong thing.
"Robin Scherbatsky's<br/>surprising erogenous zones"?
Let me clear something up for you.
Does lefty like that?
Don't want to leave out righty.
The right one's ticklish, I guess.
But the left one,<br/>I'm glad you're back there.
Because that is just some...
sweet, sweet lovin'.
Noted.
- That was a lie?<br/>- We had just started dating.
I was being nice.
And you.
{\You know, }I got it into my head this week<br/>that you were cheating on me.
I even broke open your briefcase<br/>to look for evidence.
That is a huge violation<br/>of my privacy!
Go on.
You know, in a way, I was right.<br/>You cheated.
You can't get {\some }crib sheet on dating me.<br/>That's not how it works.
If we can't figure out<br/>how to be with each other
in a real, honest way,
I don't see<br/>the point of even trying.
What do you want?
Look.
All that stuff I told Barney...
It was personal between you and me.
I'm really sorry.
{\I guess }I'm impressed<br/>by how much you remembered.
It's funny.
When you date someone,<br/>it's like you're...
taking one long course<br/>in who that person is
and then, when you break up,<br/>all that stuff becomes useless.
{\pos(192,220)}It's the emotional equivalent<br/>of an english degree.
{\I guess }I {\just }liked the idea<br/>of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky
knowledge to good use, you know?
Since you know me pretty well...
Am I fooling myself<br/>with this whole Barney thing?
I don't know.
I will say this, though.
I've seen Barney work very hard<br/>to get women.
I've seen him work very hard<br/>to get rid of women.
I've never seen him work this hard<br/>to keep one around.
I was going to give him an A.
Well, B+,<br/>Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.
Before you say anything,<br/>I am done with this stupid Robin 101.
Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.
But there's...
There's something<br/>that I did want to say to you.
Robin,<br/>I have been with a lot of women,
Blondes, brunettes, redheads.
Big boobs, small boobs,<br/>medium boobs.
Some boobs that were big,<br/>but kind of in a bad way.
The point is...<br/>Boobs that pointed in opposite direc...
The point is...
I'm really scared<br/>that you're going to dump me
and that's<br/>why I did this and I'm sorry.
You're an idiot.
You know...
That notebook does contain
a lot of personal info,
and I think it has my home address.
And your work address.
If you don't want the barrel,<br/>can you sit somewhere else?
'cause you're scaring away<br/>potential takers!
Designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham
in the beaux arts style,
this architectural gem<br/>was the first of its kind...
Professor Mosby?
That's a woman drinking beer<br/>on the toilet.
Right.<br/>That...
was Daniel Burnham's wife.
She was a troubled, troubled woman.
We are moving on.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">It was the fall of 2009<br/>and I was a professor now.
So, I decided to change my look a little bit.<br/>And people were noticing.
Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.
You know, I've always wondered why<br/>those tweed jackets have elbow patches.
Because the people<br/>who wear them are constantly going,
"Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?"
You are wrong.<br/>The ladies dig the professor look.
You know, there is something to that.
I remember thinking my<br/>tenth grade math teacher was very sexy.
I wonder if Harold's still in jail.
What? Tax evasion.
Among other things.
So, guys, Marshall and I<br/>wanted to invite you to our place
for a little couples' night.
Sure. Why not?
For years, Marshall and Lily<br/>had been the only married couple
in a group full of single people.
- It got lonely.
So, they were always searching<br/>for another couple to double-date.
There was only one problem.
- Welcome.<br/>- Gouda?
They sucked at it.
This is great. We're having fun.<br/>You're having fun, right?
So, should we just go ahead<br/>and lock the four of us in for New Year's?
Um, it's April.
Right. Sorry.<br/>We're getting ahead of ourselves.
Let's talk Thanksgiving.
Our parents<br/>really want to meet you!
Well, we should probably be going.
Wait. No, wait, if you leave now,<br/>Colonel Mustard just gets away with it.
It's getting pretty late. We're going to go.
There's still pie.
Tonight was fantastic.<br/>We should do it again.
I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I<br/>are just not that into you. And you.
But just when Lily<br/>and Marshall were about to give up,
two of their best friends<br/>in the world got together.
And hope returned to their hearts.
So, when Lily said...
Marshall and I wanted to invite you<br/>to our place for a little couples' night.
Sure, why not?
Barney and Robin had no idea<br/>what they were about to walk into.
Okay. Game time.<br/>Let's review the flow of the room.
Barney and Robin enter here.<br/>Stop here for margaritas.
That's a great conversation starter.<br/>We can tell them about our trip to Cabo.
Great, 'cause I got that story<br/>about Sammy Hagar
and the Belgian waffle locked and loaded.
Then we'll move on<br/>to the hot apps station.
And, depending on how things are going,<br/>some lively pre-dinner charades.
Right, but we'll play that one by...
Sounds like?
Okay, you can be Robin's partner.
Baby, we can do this.
- Welcome.<br/>- Gouda?
Meanwhile, my half-baked<br/>theory that ladies dig the professor look
was actually proving to be true.
- So, is it hard to grade papers?<br/>- No, you just got to make it fun.
For example, every time I spot<br/>a grammatical error, I do a shot.
I'm trashed right now,<br/>and I blame our public school system.
Sometimes things just seem<br/>to magically fall into place.
So, you said you live right upstairs?
Whether it's in the dating world...
- Take care. Bye.<br/>- Bye!
... or the double-dating world.
Nailed it!
Best night ever!
Worst night ever.
Sync by vNaru
Hey, how was the big couples' night<br/>with Marshall and Lily?
- Brutal.<br/>- Really? How?
It was like we were on a date with<br/>a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
Yeah, and they were so nervous,
that they weren't even making<br/>sense half the time.
- Hey.<br/>- Come on in.
Would you like a margarita?
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating<br/>a Belgian waffle!
And they kept shoving<br/>platters of food in our faces.
Let me guess. Did Marshall get, like,<br/>super intense about the cheese?
- Yeah, how'd you know?<br/>- Poor Marshall.
Lily's this gourmet cook,<br/>and all she lets Marshall do
is pick out one sad block of cheese.
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
You guys are going to want<br/>to get in on this gouda.
That's seared scallops<br/>with a mango chutney.
Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda.
And that's lobster ravioli<br/>in a black truffle oil.
Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.
We didn't realize<br/>there was gonna be dinner.
We sucked down a couple of tacos<br/>outside the subway.
P.S., not sitting great.
And if anything didn't go<br/>according to plan, they would freak out.
What do you mean,<br/>the egg timer is broken?
What are we going to use<br/>for charades, sweetie?
I'm working on it, darling. Okay?<br/>Just stall them.
Now, Robin. You work in television.
We're experiencing some<br/>technical difficulties. You get that?
So, we're still laughing.
Right? Laugh, Marshall.
Come on, they just got excited.
They've been looking for<br/>couple best friends forever.
Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
Show him.
This is a web site Marshall already made<br/>about last night.
It's called itwasthebestnightever. Com.
It was the best night ever
Laughter raining down like April showers
Oh, we talked for hours...
Oh, that's no good.
Best night ever<br/>Then we played charades
Lily made some creme brulée
And now that we're best couple friends
There's only one thing<br/>left to say...
Are you free? Are you free?
Are you free? Are you free?
Are you free next Saturday?
That's the 17th.
Are you free?
Friday or Sunday would also work.<br/>Or basically any other day.
Needless to say,<br/>we've both changed our e-mail addresses.
I don't understand.<br/>If last night went so horribly,
why do Lily and Marshall<br/>think it was such a hit?
I mean, we knew<br/>we were gonna have fun tonight,
but we had no idea how much.
Yeah, tough luck,<br/>every Saturday night I've ever had,
'cause this one just<br/>blew you out of the water.
- Let's do it again, soon.<br/>- Yeah, we'll call you.
They're your friends! Why would you<br/>just blatantly lie to them like that?
Well, that's what you say<br/>at the end of a crappy date.
Hey, Ted. Great time last night.<br/>Let's do it again, soon. I'll call you.
Right?
Who was that?
I don't want to brag,
but it seems chicks are really digging<br/>the whole professor thing.
Last night, she picked me up at the bar.<br/>And then...
Well, she actually wound up falling asleep<br/>on the couch. But, hey, that happens.
Uh, no, it doesn't.
Sure, it does. You know, she was...
She was just exhausted<br/>from being turned on.
But you heard her.<br/>She wants to do it again, soon.
Ted, let me ask you a question.
Where does this girl live, exactly?
Westchester. Why?
You're the Sexless Innkeeper.
Oh, my God! You're right!<br/>He's totally the Sexless Innkeeper!
What the hell is the Sexless Innkeeper?
Ted, many a man... Nay, many a soul
has their own tale<br/>of the Sexless Innkeeper.
Why, I had a run-in with one just last year.
I even composed a poem about it.
- Would you care to hear it?<br/>- Not really.
'Twas the night before New Year's,<br/>and the weather grew mean.
It was 3:00 in the morning,<br/>and I was stranded in Queens.
The tavern grew empty.<br/>The gaslights grew dim.
The horse-drawn carriages<br/>were all but snowed in...
Wait. If this was last year, why are you<br/>acting like it was Oliver Twist?
Ted, it's a poem.
Last call was approaching,<br/>and my fortunes looked bleak.
Then I turned to my left<br/>and stifled a shriek.
She had a peach fuzz beard<br/>and weighed 16 stone.
She gobbled up hot wings<br/>and swallowed the bones.
I muffled a scream<br/>and threw up in my mouth.
I asked, "Where do you live?"And she said,
"One block south."
I swallowed my pride<br/>and six shots of whiskey.
And prayed to the Gods
that she wasn't too frisky.
Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack.
'Neath her mighty hooves,<br/>the floorboards did crack.
But when she returned,<br/>she found a sound sleeper.
And thus she became<br/>the Sexless Innkeeper.
And so are you.
Wait, you're saying that girl<br/>just used me for a place to crash?
Ted, you mentioned that<br/>you live right upstairs.
She saw the tweed jacket,<br/>which basically says
you're not interested in,<br/>nor probably even capable of having sex.
And she thought, "Hey, free lodging."
No way. I'm not the Sexless Innkeeper.
Ted, that girl had no intention<br/>of ever hooking up with you.
Which is funny, because usually it's the<br/>innkeeper who offers turndown service.
Ha!
Hey, guys. Good news.
First of all, you can ignore<br/>all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.
We have. Go on.
Because we went ahead and booked
that couples' weekend<br/>for all of us in Vermont!
Wait, you guys were serious about that?
We never joke about B&amp;B's,<br/>especially at the height of syrup season.
Saturday, we've got apple-picking,<br/>antiquing, then a haunted hay ride.
And then, on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m.<br/>For the fall foliage hike.
Now, you better pack your long johns,<br/>'cause it is cold up there.
Look! I'm sorry that<br/>we have been dodging your calls,
but we respect you guys too much
as friends to give you<br/>some song and dance.
You deserve the truth.
The US Navy has found intelligent alien<br/>life at the bottom of the ocean.
For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I<br/>have been tapped to lead the expedition.
Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like<br/>the stuff you say to girls
when you're too much of a coward<br/>to dump them.
Yeah. You know,<br/>that's exactly what it sounds like.
But if that's true, that's awesome.
What's going on?
Look, all this coupley stuff, it's just not us.
Barney and I are barely equipped<br/>to date each other, let alone you guys.
Plus, the alien thing.
- Come on, Marshall. Let's go.<br/>- Yeah. Let's go.
- You know what, Lily...<br/>- No, you know what...
No. You know what?
I hope those underwater aliens<br/>are cold-blooded.
'Cause then<br/>you guys will get along just fine.
I think they bought it.
I can't believe<br/>they broke up with us.
We're so lovable.
No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.
- I thought we did everything right.<br/>- I know!
I know. We had the gouda.<br/>We had my waffle story.
I even sent them<br/>an awesome photo montage...
Nothing.
Oh, dear God.
Marshall, we've been over and over this.
You have to stop sending those to people.
It was true. Marshall had<br/>become addicted to creating songs
and photo montages documenting<br/>various mundane events.
So, for months, all of Marshall's friends<br/>and professional colleagues
were getting e-mails like this.
Ordered Chinese food today
Some moo shu pork sauce got away
Flipped the cushion<br/>Now everything's okay
Cat-sitting for Lily's mom
Cat-sitting for Lily's mom
It's gonna be fun
It's gonna bring us all closer together
Cat funeral
Cat funeral
It was an accident
And not entirely my fault
- Meow, meow, meow, meow<br/>- Cat funeral
- Meow, meow, meow, meow<br/>- Cat funeral
We'll miss you, Whiskers.
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...
I can't believe you sent them one of those.
They think we're insane now.
If I recall, they didn't dump us<br/>until you brought up that Vermont trip.
It was way too early.
First, a boat ride around the city,<br/>then a trip to Vermont.
It's a rookie mistake,<br/>and you're better than that.
What about you forgetting<br/>to check the egg timer for charades?
I gave you one thing to do, Marshall.<br/>One thing.
One thing? One thing?
Wow. Really?
So, I guess that gouda
just walked itself right through the door,
sliced itself up,
and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle
around not three, not four,
but five different kinds<br/>of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?
You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!
Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been<br/>to the bar all week.
They're taking this really hard.
Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day,
but don't you have to<br/>get back up to the inn?
I mean, who's working the front desk?
Seriously, they're your friends.<br/>You got to go apologize.
To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper,
do you do that cheapy thing where you<br/>only change the linens upon request?
I mean,<br/>how much water is that actually saving?
Robin, you know I'm right.
Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go<br/>away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
- You're right.<br/>- Thank you.
All that sexlessness has made you wise.
For God's sake!
Mint on the pillow, Ted!
And don't charge for Wi-Fi.<br/>It seems greedy!
But, eventually,<br/>even Barney and Robin had to admit
they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.
Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.
Oh, I wish you had called.
I swear, he was right there,<br/>just eating a Belgian waffle!
Well, he can't have enjoyed it<br/>as much as I'm enjoying this gouda!
Oh!
Well, listen, now's not a good time.<br/>But we'll call you.
- Wait, wait...<br/>- Look, we just want...
- Hey! Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey, hey, hey! Long time no see.
- Have a seat.<br/>- Hi.
Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.
- Yeah, so...<br/>- It's just...
We haven't seen you guys all week.
- Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.<br/>- Yeah.
It might be weird.<br/>We're kind of on a double date.
- Yeah.<br/>- Wouldn't want you to feel like
a fifth and sixth wheel.
Who the hell are these people?
They just moved here from Hawaii.
- Py is a total foodie and Shea, well...<br/>- Mmm!
- She's... Shea...<br/>- Shea.
Shea is just...
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.
We're just gonna grab a quick beer<br/>and then take these kooks
for a boat ride around the city.
Wow, it sounds like<br/>this is getting pretty serious.
Well, we don't want to jinx it, but<br/>we kind of think they might be the two.
- Who needs them?<br/>- Not us.
Living alone
We think of all the friends we've known
But when we dial the telephone
Nobody's home
Hi. Two for dinner.
Just the two of you?
All by ourselves
Don't want to be
All by ourselves anymore
All by ourselves...
Hey, why don't we call that weird couple<br/>down the hall from you?
You know, with the ferrets? Maybe<br/>they want to come over and play Taboo.
After midnight? No way.<br/>We can't Tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
Hey, guys.
Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?
Maybe. But they're Armani.
Okay, guys,<br/>I've got some bad news for you.
So, I'm just going to come out and say it.<br/>You're a couple.
And no matter how hard you try to fight it,<br/>couples need other couples.
That's why you miss Marshall and Lily.<br/>And can't you just admit that?
Oh, yeah!
- That was amazing, Lily!<br/>- Yeah.
I know! When I got that left-hand-yellow,<br/>I was like, "What?"
- You guys are the best.<br/>- Right back at you!
Ding.
For charades.
How do we know<br/>you two won't hurt us again?
You don't.
You know what? We have two<br/>very nice people up in that apartment
who are perfect for us.
Then what are you doing,<br/>standing out in the rain with us?
Damn it.
Why is there something so attractive<br/>about a bad boy and girl?
I think we can change them.
Come here, you two.
We'll never sleep on the gouda again.
All by ourselves...
Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you.<br/>You want to hear it?
- Not really.<br/>- 'Twas the night before this one,
I had hours to kill.
I sat in the tavern,<br/>grading parchments with quill.
- With quill?<br/>- Barney. It's a poem.
A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin.
Her garb said classy,<br/>but her eyes whispered sin.
She said, "You're a teacher?"<br/>I said, "Yes, indeed."
"I must have you," she moaned.<br/>"I'm turned on by tweed."
With haste we did scamper<br/>to my chamber anon.
We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on.
I unlaced her bodice.<br/>Our passions grew deeper.
And thus ends the tale<br/>of the Sexless Innkeeper.
No way. You made that up.
Are you coming back to bed, Professor?
God, I love being single.
Barney, you ready for brunch<br/>with Lily and Marshall?
What have I done?

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, as long as I'd known<br/>your Uncle Barney,
he'd always had some<br/>pretty strong opinions on relationships.
Your girlfriend? She's your "girlfriend"?<br/>She's a girl, and a friend?
(LAUGHING) How is...<br/>Do not humanize the enemy, Ted.
But nice to meet you, Barney Stinson.
OLDER TED: And yet, in the fall of 2009,<br/>he was the one with the girlfriend.
Go ahead, open it.<br/>Open it, open it, open it, open it!
It's my porn collection!
Just kidding. That would be weird.
- It's your porn collection.<br/>- It's my porn collection!
I'm giving you my porn.
Now that things are so great with Robin,<br/>I don't need it anymore.
Wow. You are voluntarily giving up<br/>your porn.
- You really are serious.<br/>- Well, that's obvious.
- What does that mean?<br/>- Oh, nothing.
It's just, you know,<br/>you got relationship gut.
What? No, I do not got "relationship gut."<br/>That is ridiculous.
It's no big deal.<br/>I mean, once you're dating someone,
it's natural to let things go a little bit.<br/>Trust me.
- We've been there.<br/>- Yeah. Boy, did I pudge out for a while.
Well, we should get going.
Goodbye, my sweet, beloved friends,<br/>who have always been there for me.
- You'll be missed.<br/>- He's talking to the porn.
Oh.
MARSHALL AND LILY: Bye, Robin.<br/>TED: See you, Robs.
(LAUGHING) Look at these videos.<br/>Space Orgy. Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23.
You'd think after the first 22 parties,<br/>the co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore.
So, we can get rid of these for you.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br/>It's not a problem. I'll take care of them.
Are you sure? I mean, no biggie.
We can just swing by the back alley<br/>and drop the box in the dumpster.
I see six of the words you just said<br/>on this video label.
Seriously, it's not a big deal.<br/>I will take care of it.
- No. 'Cause I... I mean, we...<br/>- Leave them!
Okay.
You know, in a way, it's sad, right?
I mean, Barney's giving up his porn.<br/>He's got relationship gut.
They eat at the same diner every night.
It's like the end of Barney Stinson<br/>as we know him.
- Yeah, well, so what? They're happy...<br/>- Yeah, well, we gotta go. Later.
- (WHISPERING) So, what'd you get?<br/>- I got Squat.
What are you...<br/>I thought I saw you take one?
Yeah, I did. It's called Squat.
"Archisexture."
That is not<br/>how you spell "Buckminster Fuller."
OLDER TED: Kids, pornography is bad.
And so, I was getting rid<br/>of that vile pornography right away...
I am getting rid of this vile pornography<br/>right away.
OLDER TED: When something<br/>terrible happened.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- WOMAN: (IN HUSKY VOICE) Archisexture...<br/>- Hello, Ted.
If you're watching this tape,<br/>and I knew you'd pick this one,
then you are now in possession<br/>of my porn.
This can only mean one of two things,<br/>either I'm dead,
or I'm in a committed relationship.
If I'm dead,<br/>I want you to honor my memory
by taking my body to The Hamptons<br/>and recreating Weekend at Bernie's.
I wanna dance,<br/>I wanna have sex with a girl
and I wanna go fishing.
Lf, on the other hand,<br/>I'm in a committed relationship,
then, as your best friend,<br/>I have only one request.
Please, for the love of God,<br/>get me out of it!
I might look happy, but don't believe it.
Barney Stinson is meant to be single.
So, please,<br/>if you value my best friendship...
That's right, Marshall, I'm his best friend.<br/>How does that feel?
Then get me out of this.
And, finally,<br/>since you were expecting some porn.
No, no, no, baby. Don't worry.<br/>The flashing green light means it's off.
Are we sure he was finished talking?
Look, there's no reason<br/>we should take this seriously, right?
Of course not. This is an old tape.<br/>Barney is happy with Robin.
OLDER TED: But over the next couple<br/>of weeks, I started to notice things.
Barney and Robin<br/>stopped having crazy adventures.
- So, what'd you guys do last night?<br/>- I wanted to go to a concert.
He wanted to go to a party.
Obviously, we couldn't do<br/>what just one of us wanted,
so we just stayed in,<br/>watched a movie on cable.
It was Legen... Wait for it.
...ds of the Fall. Legends of the Fall!
It was okay.
OLDER TED: Barney stopped being himself.
Hey, Barney.<br/>I'm chatting up this girl over there.
I could use a little help landing the plane.
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own wingman tonight.
(LAUGHING)
OLDER TED: And Robin got annoyed<br/>at everything he said.
So, how are you two?
- Great.<br/>- Yeah.
- Relationships are the best.<br/>- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.<br/>- The sharing, the compromise.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.<br/>- The monogamy, can't beat it.
- Catchphrase, yes.<br/>- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
OLDER TED: But the worse they got...
I'm full, sweetie.
OLDER TED: The more they kept saying<br/>things were great.
Now the truth is, Barney and Robin<br/>only let themselves go a little bit.
But I swear, after a few more weeks,<br/>to us, they seemed like this.
I'll be there, (SNIFFS) in a minute.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
- They're killing each other!<br/>- They love each other.
Barney and Robin love each other,<br/>but they're not Barney and Robin anymore.
- They're the fat guy and the old lady.<br/>- My favorite '70s detective show.
Look, it's so clear.
Barney's been overeating<br/>because he hates being tied down like this.
And Robin's stressing out because<br/>she hates what Barney's turned into.
No. They're a perfect match.
Well, maybe that's the problem.<br/>I mean, maybe they're too similar.
It must be tough having two alpha dogs<br/>in one relationship.
We have two alpha dogs<br/>in our relationship.
Sure we do, sweetie.
If they're not happy,<br/>why don't they just break up?
Because they're too stubborn.
Neither one of them wants to be the first<br/>to admit that they want out.
They're playing relationship chicken.
I think Barney ate the relationship chicken.
(TED LAUGHING)
Ted, it's just a rough patch.
It takes time<br/>getting used to being with someone else.
And they're both...
- What's the nice word for selfish?<br/>- Independent.
Independent. Every relationship<br/>goes through this.
It's true. I have this astronaut friend,<br/>totally loved his fiancée.
And then, the day before his mission,<br/>she caught him
with, like, four other chicks,<br/>a couple of dudes. Things got really tense.
Finally, she ended up sneaking out<br/>of the space shuttle...
- Are you talking about Space Orgy?<br/>- Yes, I am.
Ted, it's just a rough patch.<br/>Just let things run their course.
- She's right.<br/>- TED: But...
Two-to-one, Ted. Leave them alone.
OLDER TED: So I did leave them alone.<br/>But that weekend...
Mmm.
Have you noticed how beef ribs<br/>used to always be disgusting,
and then recently they found a way<br/>to make them really delicious instead?
Okay, Barney. I'm gonna go ahead<br/>and ask you this head on.
- Are you happy with Robin?<br/>- Are you kidding?
How could I not be happy with Robin?<br/>It's Robin!
- So are you happy?<br/>- I can't believe you'd even ask me that.
I mean, yes, we fight all the time,
but, you know what they say<br/>about relationships.
"Every moment's a battle."
So are you happy?
And you know what goes hand-in-hand<br/>with fighting, the make-up sex,
which is different when you're in<br/>a loving, long-term relationship.
Heads, we have sex.
Tails, we order a whole pizza<br/>and just lay here moaning.
Oh, great. Let the coin decide.
(BARNEY SIGHS)
- Which was pizza again?<br/>- Tails.
It was tails.
Sex. Am I right?<br/>Thank God that's mostly over.
(BURPS)
I'm still hungry. You hungry?
We have to break them up.
You're right.<br/>Barney and Robin are miserable together,
but they're too stubborn to admit it.
- So, we have to get them to break up.<br/>- How do we do that?
We unleash the Kraken.
OLDER TED: Kids, as you know,<br/>earlier that year,
I'd learned that Lily had broken up<br/>not one, not two,
but seven of my past relationships.
- Forget it. I'm retired. I'm out of the game.<br/>- But nobody's better than you.
I'm telling you. I swore off that racket.
I've gone legit. I'm a matchmaker now.
- Set me up with someone.<br/>- Whoa! I'm just starting out.
Listen, you've gotta break them up.<br/>This relationship is killing them.
I know it is, but I've learned my lesson.
No more interfering.<br/>Let things run their course.
- It's two-to-one.<br/>- Yes, but the one is me.
All right, we don't need her.<br/>We can break them up on our own.
How?
Okay, remember when Robin<br/>and I were dating?
What was the one big thing<br/>that really freaked her out?
No. No. No. No. No.<br/>Ted, you cannot do this to me.
No! No. No. No.
- What are you talking about?<br/>- This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?
If we make Robin think for even<br/>a second that Barney is proposing,
she'll lose it, and they'll break up.
That's crazy. Why don't we just, like,<br/>lead Barney into temptation?
We'll find some hot woman to hit on him.
Okay, the ring thing.
Stakeout van.
- What?<br/>- We should have gotten a stakeout van.
We could have ordered pizza,<br/>and looked through big binoculars
and said, "This ain't what I signed up for."<br/>Stuff like that.
TED: Shh... Here comes the waiter.
- Please, shut up!<br/>- What?
I thought you said something. Sorry.
Is that an engagement ring?
- Are you?<br/>- Oh, no. No.
That's not me. They must've delivered it<br/>to the wrong table.
Could you imagine, us getting married?
(LAUGHING)
Well, we are committed to each other.
BARNEY: Most of your stuff is already<br/>at my apartment.
- Might make taxes easier.<br/>- Speed up your citizenship.
- "Scherbatsky" is so hard to spell.<br/>- My mom would be so happy.
- (SIGHING) I guess so.<br/>- No reason not to.
- We're getting married!<br/>- Not so loud. Geez!
What did you do? I am furious right now.<br/>This is so wrong!
- Lily, will you be my maid of honor?<br/>- Oh, my God. I would love to.
Are you out of your mind?
You knew they were playing<br/>relationship chicken, and what did you do?
You put an engagement ring<br/>in front of them.
Okay. That's it. I'm taking over.
I'm coming out of retirement<br/>for one last breakup.
- (EX CLAIMING) Yes!<br/>- All right.
- How are we gonna do it?<br/>- These guys are in so deep
just one fight ain't gonna do it.
We need to reignite the four biggest fights<br/>they've ever been in, all at once.
Number one, the battle of the dirty dishes.
(INAUDIBLE)
Number two, the ex-girlfriend conflict.
- Hey, don't you know that girl over there?<br/>- No. I don't think so.
No, in fact, I have definitely...<br/>Hey, it's Meg.
Well, I am certainly not comparing<br/>you two in my mind right now.
Whoops. Hey, will you get that for me?
- Really?<br/>- Please?
Why do you keep doing this?<br/>You're embarrassing me in public.
You're constantly putting me<br/>in these positions.
Number three, the Star Wars altercation.
Isn't it time you got rid of your stupid doll?
It's not a doll. It's a Stormtrooper.
Uh... He's wearing a diaper.
It's not a diaper, Robin.<br/>It's protective armor.
- Stormtrooper, more like Stormpooper.<br/>- Stop it!
(IMITATING FARTING) Whoa! Oh!
It sounds like your Stormpooper here<br/>needs a changing.
Okay, you know what, I'm sick of it.
- I'm sick of your jokes.<br/>- I didn't say anything.
- Your jokes about the magic...<br/>- I can't joke?
And of course, the biggie,<br/>the Canadian-American war.
Thank God that song's over.<br/>Who the hell was that old lady singing?
Okay, you know that<br/>Neil Young is my favorite musician.
Right. Now was that the same old lady
who played Archie Bunker's wife<br/>in All in the Family,
or just a sound-alike?
Neil Young is a Canadian treasure.<br/>Do not make fun of Neil Young.
Robin, I would never make fun<br/>of a defenseless, old lady
- with vocal cord paralysis. Ever.<br/>- Here we go.
- In public? Really?<br/>- Yeah, in public. I'll go there.
- We're gonna have a fight in public?<br/>- It's nothing to be mad about.
I got it.
I got it. We e-mail them pictures<br/>reminding them of each of these fights.
You child. Here's how it goes down.
They're at the diner.
First, rekindling<br/>the Canadian-American debate,
Ontario native Alan Thicke<br/>stops by the table.
BOTH: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Alan Thicke?<br/>- Oh! Right,
Robin knew him<br/>back when she was a singer.
Yeah, and they still keep in touch.<br/>I already got his number off her phone.
Seriously, amateurs.
LILY: So Alan Thicke restarts<br/>the Canada-US fight.
Right at that moment,<br/>Crazy Meg shows up.
Then, a Stormtrooper happens to walk by<br/>the window.
And just when they can't take<br/>anything more,
a busboy walks by with a tray full of what?<br/>Dirty dishes.
(INAUDIBLE)
Lily, this is your masterpiece.
We're getting a stakeout van!
A station wagon? Really?<br/>You rented a station wagon?
- Yeah, a van cost, like, 25 bucks more.<br/>- A station wagon. (SCOFFS)
LOSTIN SPACEROBOT: Greetings, Will<br/>Robinson! Where's the birthday boy or girl?
- Hey, climb on in.<br/>- What the hell is this?
They didn't have any Stormtroopers,<br/>so I had to get a different robot.
This will still work.
Different robot?<br/>Stormtroopers aren't robots.
Of course they're robots.<br/>(ROBOT VOICE) "Must kill Luke Skywalker."
- Nobody says that in Star Wars.<br/>- Really lousy robot voice, honey.
Someone ordered an extra-large sausage.
Hey, one of Barney's videos starts off<br/>just like that.
Hey, guys,<br/>Barney's ordering five of something.
- I don't know if it's gonna fit in here.<br/>- Okay. Now you're just quoting the video.
Still ordering.<br/>Waiter's taking out a second pad.
Yeah, okay, well, we need it in here.<br/>We're on a stakeout.
Shouldn't you be in a van?
- A van costs more.<br/>- Thank you.
Score me a slice, Will Robinson.
No, no, no. You get a stain on<br/>that costume, they're gonna charge us.
- Dude, will you just chill about money.<br/>- Yeah, let the Stormtrooper have a slice.
- Yeah. It's not a Stormtrooper.<br/>- It's not a Stormtrooper.
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Hi, Lily. Sorry I'm late.<br/>I was looking for a van.
- Thank you.<br/>- $25.
- So, should I go say hi to Robin?<br/>- Not yet. Get in the car.
Okay, so wait, wait, wait.<br/>When they blew up the Death Star,
knowing full well there were thousands of<br/>Stormtroopers on it, those were people?
Well, it was called the Death Star, baby.<br/>They knew what they were getting into.
Look, I don't wanna play the<br/>"I'm Alan Thicke" card,
but I really do have<br/>a dinner to get to, so...
- Someone has gotta take this sausage.<br/>- Okay, were you in that video?
Were you the guy with the farmer tan?
LOSTIN SPACEROBOT:<br/>Jonesing for some za, Will Robinson.
- Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!<br/>- This ain't what I signed up for.
- Hey, that's my...<br/>- Okay, you know what, everyone stop!
Alan Thicke, shut up!<br/>Marshall, it's a station wagon, get over it!
Ted, stop talking about porn!
And for the love of God, somebody get<br/>the Stormtrooper some pizza!
- It's not a Stormtrooper.<br/>- It's not a Stormtrooper.
Crap!
They see us.
LOSTIN SPACEROBOT: Danger! Danger!
- (WHISPERING) Are you sure they saw us?<br/>- Yes.
Hey!
Can I go talk to Barney now?<br/>I'm so excited.
Do you really think<br/>he's gonna propose to me?
- Oh, honey.<br/>- Forget it, Crazy Meg. We've been made.
If we try anything now,<br/>they're gonna know it's us.
- I think we should all just go home.<br/>- No! This is my masterpiece.
- So what if they saw us? Lt'll still work.<br/>- Stop it! We'll think of something else.
Let me repeat, I am Alan Thicke.
- (GASPS) You're Alan Thicke?<br/>- No.
Alan Thicke, you're up. Get on out there.
OLDER TED: And so,<br/>Lily followed through with her plan.
First, Alan Thicke,
followed by Crazy Meg,
then the robot
and, finally, the dirty dishes.
But by the end of it...
LILY: They're kissing. They shouldn't be<br/>kissing. Why isn't this working?
Because they're in love.
It really was just a rough patch.
What the hell am I doing?
This whole thing was a mistake.
So, any of you dudes wanna get high?
I never thought I'd be saying this tonight,
but to Barney and Robin,<br/>the happy couple.
OLDER TED: That was the moment we<br/>learned that relationships take hard work,
but eventually, everything will work out.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- Where's Barney?<br/>- Uh... We broke up.
OLDER TED: And that was the moment<br/>we unlearned
that other lesson we had just learned<br/>a few seconds earlier.
You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought Barney<br/>and Robin had spotted her,
this is what they really saw.
Why do that fat guy and old lady keep...
Oh, my God. That's us.
Look at us. Did we always look this awful?
Robin, I'm not happy.
I mean, I wish I was. Nothing would<br/>make me happier than being happy,
but I'm not.
But what are we doing wrong?<br/>We love each other.
I mean, if this doesn't work, what will?
We're so similar.
We both like scotch.<br/>We're both awesome.
You know, maybe that's it. Maybe there's<br/>just too much awesome here.
Exactly. Two awesomes<br/>cancel each other out.
- I'm tired of being canceled out.<br/>- Me, too.
- Are we breaking up?<br/>- I think so.
Aw, crap. Now comes the next part,
the part where you and I<br/>can't go back to being friends.
Well, maybe this isn't a breakup.
Maybe this is two friends<br/>getting back together.
- ALAN: Robin?<br/>- Hi.
- It's always so great to see a fellow hoser.<br/>- Oh. Yes.
Hi. Good news. I forgive you<br/>for the whole restraining order thing.
Uh, hi.
- ROBIN: Was that a Stormtrooper?<br/>- That's not a...
- You wanna get outta here?<br/>- Yeah.
- Excuse me.<br/>- See you, guys.
- Excuse me.<br/>- Okay.
- See you, Alan.<br/>- See you, Alan.
- So, you still on 73rd Street?<br/>- How do you know that?
Getting back together as friends.<br/>I like that.
One more for the road?
And, I mean, who knows,
maybe when, like, you turn 40,<br/>if you haven't found anyone...
- I already have that deal with Ted.<br/>- Oh! Right. Stupid.
Well, maybe when you turn 39,<br/>if you haven't found anyone...
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
OLDER TED: It turns out that they really did<br/>just need to let things run their course.
- So, how's Barney doing?<br/>- He's okay, I think.
It might be a while<br/>before he fully recovers, but...
Mmm.
- Did you guys just feel a chill?<br/>- Yeah.
Daddy's home.
- Well, Robin, I'm glad we could catch up.<br/>- Yeah. Let's do it again soon.
I love that you guys are still friends<br/>so long after you did that music video.
- Yeah.<br/>- The music...
The Sandcastles video.<br/>Yes, yes. We did that together, too.
What do you mean "too"?
Well, we had this<br/>failed Canadian TV variety show.
That was so embarrassing.
Imagine what would happen<br/>if anybody ever got their hands on that?
Ooh! You.

[<div class="full-script">In the fall of 2009,<br/>a new couple had moved in upstairs.
We hadn't met them yet,<br/>but we could hear them all the time.
They were always...
Well, kids, let's just say<br/>they were always playing the bagpipes.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
I can't believe those two<br/>are still bagpiping.
I know. It's been six hours.
Must be that Tantric bagpiping<br/>that Sting is into.
She keeps yelling out for him<br/>to play the bagpipes harder,
but it sounds like<br/>he's bagpiping her pretty hard.
There's a glass of water in my bedroom<br/>that's vibrating like Jurassic Park.
You have neighbors! Shut the bagpipes up!
Sync by vNaru
I decided to go to the bar<br/>for some peace and quiet.
That didn't work out so well.
Ted, I hate to have to be the one<br/>to tell you this.
- Marshall and Lily are getting a divorce.<br/>- No, they're not.
Just listen to what I witnessed yesterday.
- Baby, you mind washing that?<br/>- No problem.
I should go.
She makes him wash his dishes<br/>right away, Ted.
I give them two, maybe three weeks, tops.
Barney, that's not a big deal.
And it's certainly not a big enough deal<br/>for you to be holding my hands.
They're in big trouble, Ted.
I see what's going on.
You, my friend, are suffering<br/>from a little-known condition,
"little-known" because I just made it up,
called New Relationship Smugness.
You and Robin<br/>are in the honeymoon phase.
Everything's perfect.
Every song on the radio's about you.<br/>Every other couple sucks.
Enjoy it. NRS doesn't last forever.
It does when you're this awesome.
Hey, check it out.<br/>Robin and I have been keeping a tally
of how many beds we've done it in.
- We're up to 83 and a half.<br/>- A half?
Nineteenth century ottoman<br/>in an antique shop.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, what's up?
Hey, tiger.
How you holding up? Do you need a hug?
You want to talk about yesterday?<br/>Safe space.
Barney thinks Lily asking you<br/>to wash your dishes right away
is a sign your marriage is crumbling.
What? Why?
Lily likes a clean sink, so I do the dishes<br/>right away, what's the big deal?
I'll tell you what the big deal is.
You know how I was always the best<br/>at being single?
No.
Well, now I am the best at relationships.<br/>Even better than you and Lily.
Aw. Look at you.
Had a girlfriend for five minutes,
you think you can play<br/>with the big boys, adorable.
Son, I've been in a relationship<br/>since you had a ponytail
and were playing Dave Matthews<br/>on your mama's Casio.
I'm a good boyfriend in my sleep.
I can rock a killer foot rub with one hand
and brew a kick-ass pot of chamomile<br/>in the other
that would make you weep.
Hell, I've forgotten more about<br/>microwaving fat-free popcorn
and watching Sandra Bullock movies<br/>than you'll ever know,
but thanks for your concern, rook.
- Marshall, let me ask you one question.<br/>- Sure.
Do you mind<br/>if there is a sink full of dirty dishes?
Not really.
Then it's Lily's problem, not yours.
Yeah, but if I said that to her,<br/>it would only lead to a fight, so...
Oh! You fight. See, Robin and I never fight.
- Of course you do.<br/>- No. And here's the secret.
Every time it looks like<br/>we're about to get into a fight...
Why is there a bag of panties<br/>labeled "April 2008" in your closet?
So any time you think you might have<br/>a fight, you just get up and leave?
100% effective.<br/>Can't fight if you're not there.
That's what Gandhi taught us.
Boy, that's not true.
I can't believe<br/>that Robin puts up with that.
Don't worry.<br/>She's got a great way to avoid fights, too.
Um, are ties machine-washable?
No, they most certainly are not. Why?
What is in your hand?
Oh, my God, what is in your hand?
Okay, so you walk away, Robin gets naked.
Those are the two stupidest ways<br/>to handle conflict I've ever heard.
Actually, the naked thing ain't bad.
That felt kind of weird.
- Okay, call me crazy.<br/>- Crazy.
But when a problem comes up,<br/>Lily and I actually talk about it.
There are so many great things to do<br/>with the human mouth.
Why waste it on talking?
But if you insist, here's what I would say<br/>about the dishes, if I were Lily's husband.
Barney, you're home!
Dude.
- Get to the point!<br/>- All right.
Thanks, doll.
Ah!
Sweetie, are you going to wash that?
I'm glad you bring that up.<br/>No. And here's why.
Lily, I know you don't like a dirty sink,
but does that make it my job<br/>to keep it clean?
I mean, if one day<br/>I look up at the living room ceiling
and think, " Hey, I'd like a replica<br/>of the Sistine Chapel up there."
- Would it be your job to paint it?<br/>- Well, no. Of course not.
Exactly! So, baby, by the same logic,
if you don't like looking at a sink<br/>full of dishes,
shouldn't it be your job to clean them?
Wow. Thanks for explaining that.<br/>I get so confused.
That's because you're a woman.
- I don't even know why we're laughing!<br/>- Of course you don't.
You're kidding me with this.
Hang on, Ted. Let's hear the man out.
Once I have her attention,<br/>it's time to bring out the big guns.
Look, I love you.
But, baby,<br/>with the little energy I have left after work,
I want to shower you with love,<br/>not wash some silly dishes.
You're right. I'll do the dishes.
Right after I do this.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Now turn around.
Firm. Oh, yeah.
Are you going to hit him or should I?
- He's right.<br/>- No, he's not. Marshall, look at me.
Do not get drawn into<br/>Barney Stinson's circus tent
of funhouse mirrors and flawed logic.
This is exactly how you got<br/>the earring back in '03.
- Hey, that earring looked cool.<br/>- It did look cool, didn't it?
Marshall, stay with me! Barney is wrong.
No, he isn't.<br/>I hate doing my dishes right away.
- You just said you don't mind!<br/>- I hate it, Ted!
I hate it with a boundless, burning fury.<br/>I hate it. I hate it, I hate it!
You're welcome.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey.
Oh! Good. There you are.<br/>You'll tell me the truth.
Barney says that you two never fight.
- Oh! I guess that's true.<br/>- Told you.
No way. I love you both,
but you are the two most emotionally<br/>ill-equipped individuals
in the history of relationships.
You two must have had at least one fight.
You know what? We did.
- Aha!<br/>- Mmm-hmm.
There was one small dispute
about which one of us<br/>was more awesome.
We just called it a tie and had sex.
Speaking of which, I am so glad
we're going skiing this weekend.<br/>I need a break.
The upstairs neighbors<br/>are driving me crazy.
Yeah, it's bad.<br/>I'm gonna say something to them.
- Thank you.<br/>- Great.
Okay, we all have our assignments<br/>for the weekend.
Ted, you're going to stand up<br/>to your neighbors.
Marshall, you're going to stand up to Lily.
And Robin, I'm gonna need you<br/>in sort of a crouched position
on the bear-skin rug at our ski chalet.
Ready? Break!
- Bye, guys.<br/>- Bye. Have fun.
Barney, you know,<br/>with his crazy, well-thought-out theories
that probably would work.
Marshall, I'm just gonna say this<br/>one more time.
- It's a bad idea.<br/>- I think it could work.
Okay, two more times. It's a bad idea.
Listen, Barney lays out<br/>some logical points.
Lily is a reasonable woman.
I think that if I explain it to her,<br/>she'll get it and I'll get my way.
No. She'll get mad,<br/>and you'll get in a huge fight.
- Slap bet?<br/>- Slap bet.
Baby, could you wash your dishes?
Lily, I'm glad that you bring that up.
Can I stay here tonight?
I'll make up the sofa, buddy.
The ski bunnies are back!
Hey, guys. How was your trip?
So perfect.
We spent the whole weekend<br/>cuddling by the fire.
No black diamonds, but a lot of red hearts.
Oh!
Okay, I'm gonna go unpack.
- Hey, you.<br/>- Yeah?
Uh-huh.
- Ooh!<br/>- Uh-huh.
Oh, man.
What the hell has gotten into you two?<br/>When did you become so nauseating?
Isn't it great to finally see her fulfilled<br/>emotionally, spiritually and sexually?
- Um, I dated her for a year.<br/>- Yeah.
Anyway, how was your weekend?
Terrible, and it's all your fault, okay?<br/>I took your stupid advice.
Baby, could you wash your dishes?
Lily, I'm glad that you bring that up.
No. And here is why.
Okay.
So, it's like this, okay.
Yeah, sure. You want me<br/>to go ahead and wash my dish.
But maybe I want you<br/>to paint the ceiling, right?
And maybe I should say,
"Okay, yeah. I'll wash my dish<br/>if you get up there and just...
"You paint naked babies on the ceiling."
You know? It's just like...
Huh?
Huh?
I don't know what happened.<br/>I'm a lawyer. I argue for a living,
but when it comes to Lily,<br/>I just get all flustered.
How could you not?<br/>I mean, the girl's all eyes and boobs.
What happened to the<br/>"I'm tired after my draining day
"and I want to use my leftover energy<br/>showering you with love" argument?
I should have written that down.
Look, Lily, I...
- I make more money than you.<br/>- Excuse me?
Dance for me.
- Oh, Marshall.<br/>- Dude.
It all made so much sense<br/>when you said it,
but when I said it, it turned into a fight.
And once Lily and I start fighting,<br/>the fight starts to mutate and multiply.
Sure, it started with the dishes,<br/> but then...
So you're saying<br/>that you shouldn't have to wash dishes
because you work harder than me?
Okay, that's not what I'm saying,<br/>but it's true.
And then all of a sudden,<br/>we're also fighting about who works harder.
I teach kindergarten.
I am molding the future leaders<br/>of tomorrow.
You eat cookies and glue stuff.
And soon more fights spin off.
I can't believe you'd rather be killed...
Until there are more fights<br/>going on than you can even keep track of.
If you need to go<br/>in the middle of the night,
either turn the bathroom light on<br/>or sit down.
My mother does not hate you.
She is neutral about you.
I am not scared<br/>of your Shining impression.
I just don't need to hear it,<br/>especially at night.
"Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance."
Please don't do that.
Man, Lily fights dirty.
She's small but vicious, like a badger
that your brothers caught<br/>and starved for five days
and then put in your sleeping bag.
I should just go home and apologize.
No. What you need is a surge. Fight harder.
Picture it, Marshall,
never having to wash another dish<br/>as long as you live,
yet all the dishes are always clean.
Why, this would take all the anxiety<br/>out of snacking.
No more holding open your shirt
to form a makeshift bowl<br/>for your salty treats.
That world is yours, Marshall.
Reach out, take it.<br/>Dip it in some ranch dressing, enjoy.
- He's right.<br/>- No!
Barney's stupid ideas<br/>are what got you into this quagmire.
There's no exit strategy.<br/>Just wash your stupid dishes.
No! Those dishes are my manhood.
And if I want to leave my manhood<br/>dirty in the sink,
- caked with ketchup and pasta...<br/>- What are you eating?
...then damn it, that's my right!
I'll wash my manhood<br/>when I'm good and ready!
Where was he not sitting?
- Hmm. Hey, Barnstormer.<br/>- Hey, Ro-Ro.
Ooh!
Okay, now you have adorable nicknames?<br/>Seriously, what's going on with you two?
Nothing. We're just happy.
It's like Gandhi said,<br/>"Smile don't cost nothing, sugar."
I'm not sure you know who Gandhi is.
So, Ted, did you talk to our neighbors?
Yes, yeah, I did.<br/>I went up there ready to set them straight.
- They're old?<br/>- Really old.
So what did you do?
Well, I didn't have the heart<br/>to tell them to stop,
because, well, good for them.
So I just welcomed them to the building,<br/>had a hard candy,
nodded politely at some racist comments<br/>and then left.
Over the next couple of days,
Barney and Robin<br/>continued to be happier than ever.
And Marshall and Lily continued to fight.
I don't care if the dishes aren't done.<br/>Okay, if you care, you do it.
Great. Then I don't care<br/>if you have an orgasm.
If you care, you do it.
I went 18 years<br/>without the touch of a woman.
- I can do it again.<br/>- You might have to.
And I continued to hear more<br/>bagpiping than the St. Patty's Day parade.
I don't know what to do.<br/>Lily and I have never had a fight this long.
It's like I don't even exist.
On Sunday morning,<br/>she made pancake, Ted.
Pancake and bacon strip.
It's your own fault.<br/>You took relationship advice from Barney.
Well, maybe Barney has it all figured out.
He and Ro-Ro are the best couple now.
Lily and I have been dethroned.
You know what, I'm not buying it.
All that cutesy, lovey-dovey crap,<br/>that's not them.
And I know for a fact<br/>that Robin hates nicknames.
- Thanks, Robbsy-wobbsy.<br/>- Yeah, I don't do nicknames.
- Finished with the sports page, Sherbs?<br/>- Seriously, stop.
Hey, Robin, it's T-Mose.
Yeah, I don't like them on you, either.
Well, she obviously likes them now.
And come on,<br/>somebody had to put an end to T-Mose.
No, T-Mose was awesome.
I'm thinking of bringing it back.
Bagpiping sounds a little different today.<br/>It's all echo-y.
Yeah. They're in the bathroom.
I think they're bagpiping<br/>on the shower chair.
And just like that,
I realized exactly how to get the real scoop<br/>on Barney and Robin.
Hey, Ted. How are Marshall and Lily?
- I worry about those two, I really do.<br/>- You and your big, giant heart.
Okay, enough. The jig is up.
Ted, whatever do you mean?
- Who's this guy?<br/>- We'll get to that.
You see, I knew something was wrong.
You two were too happy, too shiny,<br/>too nickname-y.
Didn't add up.
You two never fight? Horse apples.
You fight all the time.
- How would you know that?<br/>- Phil told me.
- Who the hell is Phil?<br/>- Your downstairs neighbor.
Hi. I'm Phil. 12 B.
And he's heard everything.
So Phil tells me that Ro-Ro<br/>and the Barnstormer
have been fighting a lot. Care to explain?
Okay. Everything was going great.
Our no-fighting techniques<br/>were working perfectly
until we went on that ski trip<br/>last weekend.
Hmm.
So I showed Marshall<br/>that Lily's argument was bananas
and now he'll never have to wash<br/>another dish.
- High two.<br/>- That's terrible advice.
What? You agree with Lily? You...
Oh, no. We're about to<br/>get in a fight, and I can't run away.
I can't take my clothes off.<br/>It's freezing up here. I'd get hypothermia.
- Maybe I can jump it?<br/>- Maybe just my pants?
- This no-fighting thing is over, huh?<br/>- I think so.
- How could you possibly...<br/>- I can't believe...
...agree with Lily?<br/>...that you made Lily
- get in a fight about this!<br/>- She's shorter than him!
And it didn't end there.<br/>We've been fighting ever since.
All those fights we kept not having,<br/>they all came back around.
- The bag of panties.<br/>- The tie Robin murdered.
- The tiny camera I found in the headboard.<br/>- That's how a quarterback stays sharp.
Monday morning, he sits on a bag of ice<br/>and studies the game tape.
- Barney, for the millionth...<br/>- You don't get to be...
...using football analogies...<br/>...as good as I am...
...and studying technique!<br/>...does not make it any less creepy.
I knew it! I knew you guys<br/>were acting too cute and perfect.
Look, we were just sick<br/>of everyone pointing out
how crappy at relationships we both are.
Yeah, it was sort of nice<br/>to be the perfect couple for a minute.
I knew you were lying.
You got to wake up pretty early<br/>to slip one by the T-Mose.
Stop it.
Marshall, dinner's ready.
Did you... Did you make any for me?
No, but it's your favorite.
Hey. We need your advice.
So Barney and Robin<br/>told Lily and Marshall
all about their fighting.
And let's just say, that in comparison,
their little dishes spat<br/>seemed pretty tame.
And by the end,
Lily and Marshall<br/>both had the same reaction.
I'll wash my dishes right away from now<br/>until the day I die.
I don't care when you wash the dishes.
But if it's something cheese-based,<br/>like a nice ziti, at least soak it, okay?
Of course, baby.
- I love you.<br/>- I love you, too.
See? Right there,<br/>how did you just do that?
- How'd you just fix everything?<br/>- I don't know.
I guess sometimes<br/>you just have to set your ego aside.
Yeah. And remember that the love<br/>that you have for that other person
is way more important than winning.
- More important than winning.<br/>- Stop, stop it.
Seriously, what's the secret?
Okay, look,<br/>the honeymoon period may be over,
but now you can get into the real stuff.
And honestly, that's the best part.
Good night.
So what do we do now?
I guess we got to start talking more<br/>and get into the real stuff.
- Yeah. Or there's a bench in the elevator.<br/>- That's better.
Hey, so what if we're not<br/>the best couple in the world?
- Totally. It's not a competition.<br/>- No.
- We win!<br/>- Best couple in the world!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Guess what? These glasses are plastic.
So we can just throw them away.<br/>That means no dirty dishes in the sink.
You're dirty.<br/>Maybe I should leave you in the sink.
And once that first argument<br/>got worked out,
all those other arguments,<br/>well, they got better, too.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, as long as I'd known<br/>your Uncle Barney,
he'd always had some<br/>pretty strong opinions on relationships.
Your girlfriend? She's your "girlfriend"?<br/>She's a girl, and a friend?
How is...<br/>Do not humanize the enemy, Ted.
But nice to meet you, Barney Stinson.
And yet, in the fall of 2009,<br/>he was the one with the girlfriend.
Go ahead, open it.<br/>Open it, open it, open it, open it!
It's my porn collection!
Just kidding. That would be weird.
- It's your porn collection.<br/>- It's my porn collection!
I'm giving you my porn.
Now that things are so great with Robin,<br/>I don't need it anymore.
Wow. You are voluntarily giving up<br/>your porn.
- You really are serious.<br/>- Well, that's obvious.
- What does that mean?<br/>- Oh, nothing.
It's just, you know,<br/>you got relationship gut.
What? No, I do not got "relationship gut."<br/>That is ridiculous.
It's no big deal.<br/>I mean, once you're dating someone,
it's natural to let things go a little bit.<br/>Trust me.
- We've been there.<br/>- Yeah. Boy, did I pudge out for a while.
Well, we should get going.
Goodbye, my sweet, beloved friends,<br/>who have always been there for me.
- You'll be missed.<br/>- He's talking to the porn.
Oh.
- Bye, Robin.<br/>- See you, Robs.
Look at these videos.<br/>Space Orgy. Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23.
You'd think after the first 22 parties,<br/>the co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore.
So, we can get rid of these for you.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br/>It's not a problem. I'll take care of them.
Are you sure? I mean, no biggie.
We can just swing by the back alley<br/>and drop the box in the dumpster.
I see six of the words you just said<br/>on this video label.
Seriously, it's not a big deal.<br/>I will take care of it.
- No. 'Cause I... I mean, we...<br/>- Leave them!
Okay.
You know, in a way, it's sad, right?
I mean, Barney's giving up his porn.<br/>He's got relationship gut.
They eat at the same diner every night.
It's like the end of Barney Stinson<br/>as we know him.
- Yeah, well, so what? They're happy...<br/>- Yeah, well, we gotta go. Later.
- So, what'd you get?<br/>- I got Squat.
What are you...<br/>I thought I saw you take one?
Yeah, I did. It's called Squat.
"Archisexture."
That is not<br/>how you spell "Buckminster Fuller."
Kids, pornography is bad.
And so, I was getting rid<br/>of that vile pornography right away...
I am getting rid of this vile pornography<br/>right away.
When something<br/>terrible happened.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- Archisexture...<br/>- Hello, Ted.
If you're watching this tape,<br/>and I knew you'd pick this one,
then you are now in possession<br/>of my porn.
This can only mean one of two things,<br/>either I'm dead,
or I'm in a committed relationship.
If I'm dead,<br/>I want you to honor my memory
by taking my body to The Hamptons<br/>and recreating Weekend at Bernie's.
I wanna dance,<br/>I wanna have sex with a girl
and I wanna go fishing.
Lf, on the other hand,<br/>I'm in a committed relationship,
then, as your best friend,<br/>I have only one request.
Please, for the love of God,<br/>get me out of it!
Sync by vNaru
I might look happy, but don't believe it.
Barney Stinson is meant to be single.
So, please,<br/>if you value my best friendship...
That's right, Marshall, I'm his best friend.<br/>How does that feel?
Then get me out of this.
And, finally,<br/>since you were expecting some porn.
No, no, no, baby. Don't worry.<br/>The flashing green light means it's off.
Are we sure he was finished talking?
Look, there's no reason<br/>we should take this seriously, right?
Of course not. This is an old tape.<br/>Barney is happy with Robin.
But over the next couple<br/>of weeks, I started to notice things.
Barney and Robin<br/>stopped having crazy adventures.
- So, what'd you guys do last night?<br/>- I wanted to go to a concert.
He wanted to go to a party.
Obviously, we couldn't do<br/>what just one of us wanted,
so we just stayed in,<br/>watched a movie on cable.
It was Legen... Wait for it.
...ds of the Fall. Legends of the Fall!
It was okay.
Barney stopped being himself.
Hey, Barney.<br/>I'm chatting up this girl over there.
I could use a little help landing the plane.
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own wingman tonight.
And Robin got annoyed<br/>at everything he said.
So, how are you two?
- Great.<br/>- Yeah.
- Relationships are the best.<br/>- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.<br/>- The sharing, the compromise.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.<br/>- The monogamy, can't beat it.
- Catchphrase, yes.<br/>- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
But the worse they got...
I'm full, sweetie.
The more they kept saying<br/>things were great.
Now the truth is, Barney and Robin<br/>only let themselves go a little bit.
But I swear, after a few more weeks,<br/>to us, they seemed like this.
I'll be there, (SNIFFS) in a minute.
Hey.
- They're killing each other!<br/>- They love each other.
Barney and Robin love each other,<br/>but they're not Barney and Robin anymore.
- They're the fat guy and the old lady.<br/>- My favorite '70s detective show.
Look, it's so clear.
Barney's been overeating<br/>because he hates being tied down like this.
And Robin's stressing out because<br/>she hates what Barney's turned into.
No. They're a perfect match.
Well, maybe that's the problem.<br/>I mean, maybe they're too similar.
It must be tough having two alpha dogs<br/>in one relationship.
We have two alpha dogs<br/>in our relationship.
Sure we do, sweetie.
If they're not happy,<br/>why don't they just break up?
Because they're too stubborn.
Neither one of them wants to be the first<br/>to admit that they want out.
They're playing relationship chicken.
I think Barney ate the relationship chicken.
Ted, it's just a rough patch.
It takes time<br/>getting used to being with someone else.
And they're both...
- What's the nice word for selfish?<br/>- Independent.
Independent. Every relationship<br/>goes through this.
It's true. I have this astronaut friend,<br/>totally loved his fiancée.
And then, the day before his mission,<br/>she caught him
with, like, four other chicks,<br/>a couple of dudes. Things got really tense.
Finally, she ended up sneaking out<br/>of the space shuttle...
- Are you talking about Space Orgy?<br/>- Yes, I am.
Ted, it's just a rough patch.<br/>Just let things run their course.
- She's right.<br/>- But...
Two-to-one, Ted. Leave them alone.
So I did leave them alone.<br/>But that weekend...
Mmm.
Have you noticed how beef ribs<br/>used to always be disgusting,
and then recently they found a way<br/>to make them really delicious instead?
Okay, Barney. I'm gonna go ahead<br/>and ask you this head on.
- Are you happy with Robin?<br/>- Are you kidding?
How could I not be happy with Robin?<br/>It's Robin!
- So are you happy?<br/>- I can't believe you'd even ask me that.
I mean, yes, we fight all the time,
but, you know what they say<br/>about relationships.
"Every moment's a battle."
So are you happy?
And you know what goes hand-in-hand<br/>with fighting, the make-up sex,
which is different when you're in<br/>a loving, long-term relationship.
Heads, we have sex.
Tails, we order a whole pizza<br/>and just lay here moaning.
Oh, great. Let the coin decide.
- Which was pizza again?<br/>- Tails.
It was tails.
Sex. Am I right?<br/>Thank God that's mostly over.
I'm still hungry. You hungry?
We have to break them up.
You're right.<br/>Barney and Robin are miserable together,
but they're too stubborn to admit it.
- So, we have to get them to break up.<br/>- How do we do that?
We unleash the Kraken.
Kids, as you know,<br/>earlier that year,
I'd learned that Lily had broken up<br/>not one, not two,
but seven of my past relationships.
- Forget it. I'm retired. I'm out of the game.<br/>- But nobody's better than you.
I'm telling you. I swore off that racket.
I've gone legit. I'm a matchmaker now.
- Set me up with someone.<br/>- Whoa! I'm just starting out.
Listen, you've gotta break them up.<br/>This relationship is killing them.
I know it is, but I've learned my lesson.
No more interfering.<br/>Let things run their course.
- It's two-to-one.<br/>- Yes, but the one is me.
All right, we don't need her.<br/>We can break them up on our own.
How?
Okay, remember when Robin<br/>and I were dating?
What was the one big thing<br/>that really freaked her out?
No. No. No. No. No.<br/>Ted, you cannot do this to me.
No! No. No. No.
- What are you talking about?<br/>- This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?
If we make Robin think for even<br/>a second that Barney is proposing,
she'll lose it, and they'll break up.
That's crazy. Why don't we just, like,<br/>lead Barney into temptation?
We'll find some hot woman to hit on him.
Okay, the ring thing.
Stakeout van.
- What?<br/>- We should have gotten a stakeout van.
We could have ordered pizza,<br/>and looked through big binoculars
and said, "This ain't what I signed up for."<br/>Stuff like that.
Shh... Here comes the waiter.
- Please, shut up!<br/>- What?
I thought you said something. Sorry.
Is that an engagement ring?
- Are you?<br/>- Oh, no. No.
That's not me. They must've delivered it<br/>to the wrong table.
Could you imagine, us getting married?
Well, we are committed to each other.
Most of your stuff is already<br/>at my apartment.
- Might make taxes easier.<br/>- Speed up your citizenship.
- "Scherbatsky" is so hard to spell.<br/>- My mom would be so happy.
- I guess so.<br/>- No reason not to.
- We're getting married!<br/>- Not so loud. Geez!
What did you do? I am furious right now.<br/>This is so wrong!
- Lily, will you be my maid of honor?<br/>- Oh, my God. I would love to.
Are you out of your mind?
You knew they were playing<br/>relationship chicken, and what did you do?
You put an engagement ring<br/>in front of them.
Okay. That's it. I'm taking over.
I'm coming out of retirement<br/>for one last breakup.
- Yes!<br/>- All right.
- How are we gonna do it?<br/>- These guys are in so deep
just one fight ain't gonna do it.
We need to reignite the four biggest fights<br/>they've ever been in, all at once.
Number one, the battle of the dirty dishes.
Number two, the ex-girlfriend conflict.
- Hey, don't you know that girl over there?<br/>- No. I don't think so.
No, in fact, I have definitely...<br/>Hey, it's Meg.
Well, I am certainly not comparing<br/>you two in my mind right now.
Whoops. Hey, will you get that for me?
- Really?<br/>- Please?
Why do you keep doing this?<br/>You're embarrassing me in public.
You're constantly putting me<br/>in these positions.
Number three, the Star Wars altercation.
Isn't it time you got rid of your stupid doll?
It's not a doll. It's a Stormtrooper.
Uh... He's wearing a diaper.
It's not a diaper, Robin.<br/>It's protective armor.
- Stormtrooper, more like Stormpooper.<br/>- Stop it!
Whoa! Oh!
It sounds like your Stormpooper here<br/>needs a changing.
Okay, you know what, I'm sick of it.
- I'm sick of your jokes.<br/>- I didn't say anything.
- Your jokes about the magic...<br/>- I can't joke?
And of course, the biggie,<br/>the Canadian-American war.
Thank God that song's over.<br/>Who the hell was that old lady singing?
Okay, you know that<br/>Neil Young is my favorite musician.
Right. Now was that the same old lady
who played Archie Bunker's wife<br/>in All in the Family,
or just a sound-alike?
Neil Young is a Canadian treasure.<br/>Do not make fun of Neil Young.
Robin, I would never make fun<br/>of a defenseless, old lady
- with vocal cord paralysis. Ever.<br/>- Here we go.
- In public? Really?<br/>- Yeah, in public. I'll go there.
- We're gonna have a fight in public?<br/>- It's nothing to be mad about.
I got it.
I got it. We e-mail them pictures<br/>reminding them of each of these fights.
You child. Here's how it goes down.
They're at the diner.
First, rekindling<br/>the Canadian-American debate,
Ontario native Alan Thicke<br/>stops by the table.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Alan Thicke?<br/>- Oh! Right,
Robin knew him<br/>back when she was a singer.
Yeah, and they still keep in touch.<br/>I already got his number off her phone.
Seriously, amateurs.
So Alan Thicke restarts<br/>the Canada-US fight.
Right at that moment,<br/>Crazy Meg shows up.
Then, a Stormtrooper happens to walk by<br/>the window.
And just when they can't take<br/>anything more,
a busboy walks by with a tray full of what?<br/>Dirty dishes.
Lily, this is your masterpiece.
We're getting a stakeout van!
A station wagon? Really?<br/>You rented a station wagon?
- Yeah, a van cost, like, 25 bucks more.<br/>- A station wagon.
Greetings, Will<br/>Robinson! Where's the birthday boy or girl?
- Hey, climb on in.<br/>- What the hell is this?
They didn't have any Stormtroopers,<br/>so I had to get a different robot.
This will still work.
Different robot?<br/>Stormtroopers aren't robots.
Of course they're robots.<br/>"Must kill Luke Skywalker."
- Nobody says that in Star Wars.<br/>- Really lousy robot voice, honey.
Someone ordered an extra-large sausage.
Hey, one of Barney's videos starts off<br/>just like that.
Hey, guys,<br/>Barney's ordering five of something.
- I don't know if it's gonna fit in here.<br/>- Okay. Now you're just quoting the video.
Still ordering.<br/>Waiter's taking out a second pad.
Yeah, okay, well, we need it in here.<br/>We're on a stakeout.
Shouldn't you be in a van?
- A van costs more.<br/>- Thank you.
Score me a slice, Will Robinson.
No, no, no. You get a stain on<br/>that costume, they're gonna charge us.
- Dude, will you just chill about money.<br/>- Yeah, let the Stormtrooper have a slice.
- Yeah. It's not a Stormtrooper.<br/>- It's not a Stormtrooper.
Hi, Lily. Sorry I'm late.<br/>I was looking for a van.
- Thank you.<br/>- $25.
- So, should I go say hi to Robin?<br/>- Not yet. Get in the car.
Okay, so wait, wait, wait.<br/>When they blew up the Death Star,
knowing full well there were thousands of<br/>Stormtroopers on it, those were people?
Well, it was called the Death Star, baby.<br/>They knew what they were getting into.
Look, I don't wanna play the<br/>"I'm Alan Thicke" card,
but I really do have<br/>a dinner to get to, so...
- Someone has gotta take this sausage.<br/>- Okay, were you in that video?
Were you the guy with the farmer tan?
Jonesing for some za, Will Robinson.
- Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!<br/>- This ain't what I signed up for.
- Hey, that's my...<br/>- Okay, you know what, everyone stop!
Alan Thicke, shut up!<br/>Marshall, it's a station wagon, get over it!
Ted, stop talking about porn!
And for the love of God, somebody get<br/>the Stormtrooper some pizza!
- It's not a Stormtrooper.<br/>- It's not a Stormtrooper.
Crap!
They see us.
Danger! Danger!
- Are you sure they saw us?<br/>- Yes.
Hey!
Can I go talk to Barney now?<br/>I'm so excited.
Do you really think<br/>he's gonna propose to me?
- Oh, honey.<br/>- Forget it, Crazy Meg. We've been made.
If we try anything now,<br/>they're gonna know it's us.
- I think we should all just go home.<br/>- No! This is my masterpiece.
- So what if they saw us? Lt'll still work.<br/>- Stop it! We'll think of something else.
Let me repeat, I am Alan Thicke.
- You're Alan Thicke?<br/>- No.
Alan Thicke, you're up. Get on out there.
And so,<br/>Lily followed through with her plan.
First, Alan Thicke,
followed by Crazy Meg,
then the robot
and, finally, the dirty dishes.
But by the end of it...
They're kissing. They shouldn't be<br/>kissing. Why isn't this working?
Because they're in love.
It really was just a rough patch.
What the hell am I doing?
This whole thing was a mistake.
So, any of you dudes wanna get high?
I never thought I'd be saying this tonight,
but to Barney and Robin,<br/>the happy couple.
That was the moment we<br/>learned that relationships take hard work,
but eventually, everything will work out.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- Where's Barney?<br/>- Uh... We broke up.
And that was the moment<br/>we unlearned
that other lesson we had just learned<br/>a few seconds earlier.
You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought Barney<br/>and Robin had spotted her,
this is what they really saw.
Why do that fat guy and old lady keep...
Oh, my God. That's us.
Look at us. Did we always look this awful?
Robin, I'm not happy.
I mean, I wish I was. Nothing would<br/>make me happier than being happy,
but I'm not.
But what are we doing wrong?<br/>We love each other.
I mean, if this doesn't work, what will?
We're so similar.
We both like scotch.<br/>We're both awesome.
You know, maybe that's it. Maybe there's<br/>just too much awesome here.
Exactly. Two awesomes<br/>cancel each other out.
- I'm tired of being canceled out.<br/>- Me, too.
- Are we breaking up?<br/>- I think so.
Aw, crap. Now comes the next part,
the part where you and I<br/>can't go back to being friends.
Well, maybe this isn't a breakup.
Maybe this is two friends<br/>getting back together.
- Robin?<br/>- Hi.
- It's always so great to see a fellow hoser.<br/>- Oh. Yes.
Hi. Good news. I forgive you<br/>for the whole restraining order thing.
Uh, hi.
- Was that a Stormtrooper?<br/>- That's not a...
- You wanna get outta here?<br/>- Yeah.
- Excuse me.<br/>- See you, guys.
- Excuse me.<br/>- Okay.
- See you, Alan.<br/>- See you, Alan.
- So, you still on 73rd Street?<br/>- How do you know that?
Getting back together as friends.<br/>I like that.
One more for the road?
And, I mean, who knows,
maybe when, like, you turn 40,<br/>if you haven't found anyone...
- I already have that deal with Ted.<br/>- Oh! Right. Stupid.
Well, maybe when you turn 39,<br/>if you haven't found anyone...
It turns out that they really did<br/>just need to let things run their course.
- So, how's Barney doing?<br/>- He's okay, I think.
It might be a while<br/>before he fully recovers, but...
Mmm.
- Did you guys just feel a chill?<br/>- Yeah.
Daddy's home.
- Well, Robin, I'm glad we could catch up.<br/>- Yeah. Let's do it again soon.
I love that you guys are still friends<br/>so long after you did that music video.
- Yeah.<br/>- The music...
The Sandcastles video.<br/>Yes, yes. We did that together, too.
What do you mean "too"?
Well, we had this<br/>failed Canadian TV variety show.
That was so embarrassing.
Imagine what would happen<br/>if anybody ever got their hands on that?
Ooh! You.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, the secret to dating<br/>is very simple:
be confident, be comfortable<br/>in your skin,
be assured of who you are.
Barney was really good<br/>at that last one,
even though a lot of the time<br/>who he was was someone else.
Hi. Do you see that guy<br/>over there in the scuba suit?
You thinking of going<br/>and talking to him?
Good. He's seriously the biggest jerk<br/>on the face of the earth.
- How do you know him?<br/>- He's one of my best friends.
- So what's with the scuba suit?<br/>- Well, it's a long story.
He just went through a breakup...
There's two basic philosophies of<br/>how to handle yourself after a breakup.
Some people throw themselves into...
My career. That's my number one<br/>focus right now.
From now on, no more dating.
Just work.
While others{\throw<br/>themselves into}...
Every woman in New York City.
That's right, Barney Stinson<br/>is back on the market.
Mothers, lock up your daughters.
Daughters, lock up your milswancas.
- Milswancas?<br/>- Wait, I can get this.
Mothers I'd like to sleep with<br/>and never call again.
Correct!<br/>Circle gets the square.
Don't you think you're kinda<br/>rushing back into this?
Lily, since I started dating<br/>Robin, there's a certain
thing haven't used as much<br/>as I would like to.
It's... Kinda big,
surprisingly heavy,
kind of leathery, and it's black.
This, my friends...
Is the Playbook.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
The Playbook contains<br/>every scam, con, hustle,
hoodwink, gambit, flimflam,
stratagem and bamboozle<br/>I've ever used...
or ever hope to use...<br/>To pick up chicks
and give them the business.
You wrote another book?
We got a... Stephen King over here.
It's all in here.
Everything from basic moves like<br/>"the don't drink that."
Don't drink that.<br/>I saw some guy slip something in there.
What? Who?
That guy.
Thank you.
To more advanced maneuvers<br/>like "the Mrs. Stinsfire."
Now kappas, after our<br/>disciplinary hearing
for lewd behavior last semester,
we have been assigned<br/>a new housemom.
I'd like you to meet mrs. Stinsfire.
Hello, girls!
I can't picture a way<br/>that wouldn't work.
What's "the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"?
I'm glad you asked.
"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" will be
my grand return to the stage.
Or you know, the bed.
Actually, my bed<br/>is kind of on a stage.
I put a platform <br/>and got some lights.
It's a real production.<br/>Barney exits!
How about you?<br/>You getting back out there?
- Where is your Playbook?<br/>- My Playbook?
Bro, two-volume set, right here.
- It's a great read actually.<br/>- Yeah, I'm reading it right now.
I told you,<br/>I'm taking a break from all that.
- Marshall, it's totally gonna happen.<br/>- So gonna happen.
- What?<br/>- You're gonna fall in love.
So soon.
Not likely.<br/>I'm focusing on my career.
- I'm done with dating.<br/>- Okay, we playing the pyramid?
"Things people say right before<br/>they meet the love of their life."
Kelly Harris, girl I went<br/>to law school with said...
Law school's so hard,<br/>I just want to focus on my studies.
Six months later?
Married!
That's all w...
Travis Frenchroy, backup<br/>bartender tells me...
I'm so over the whole dating game.
I just want to focus<br/>on my Star Trek fan fiction.
Six months later...
Married!
May I respond?
That's all well and good for...
Matthew Blitz,<br/>accountant at my office says...
I'm gonna die single and alone.
I might as well just focus<br/>on this year's taxes.
Six months later?
City union and planning to get married<br/>pending the passage of legislation
currently on the floor of the NY<br/>sate senate.
Protest all you want,<br/>but it's gonna happen.
- It's a law of nature.<br/>- Lawyered. Of nature.
I'd love to have<br/>no interest in a relationship.
There's no way I'd be single right now<br/>if I wanted to be single.
- Okay, now you're ready.<br/>- Ready for what?
Three years ago, this girl Shelly<br/>started teaching at my school.
The moment I saw her, I was like,
"this is the girl for Ted."
Why am I just hearing about her now?
You know, I usually<br/>hate being set up
but this Ted just sounds so great.
He is. He's so sweet and thoughtful<br/>and intelligent.
Come on! One more chicken finger<br/>and the crown is yours!
I don't see him anywhere.<br/>He must be out doing charity work.
So, different bar?
That girl with Lily's pretty cute!
Yeah, she was cute.
Yeah, still is.<br/>And now you're ready.
Bro, now you can fit like, three times<br/>as many chicken fingers in your mouth.
- You know it.<br/>- OK, I will set it up,
but promise me you won't<br/>do anything stupid.
I promise I won't do<br/>anything stupid.
And I kept that promise.
But only because...
She never showed up.
- I know. I'm sorry, I feel terrible.<br/>- You should feel terrible!
- I do feel terrible! I do!<br/>- You should!
- I do, I do!<br/>- You should! You should!
I don't.
Look, I was really<br/>looking forward to meeting Ted,
but I got to the bar an hour early
and I met this amazing guy.
Like, seriously amazing.
And you met him at Maclaren's?
- Yeah, right at the bar.<br/>- What's his name?
I shouldn't say.
What the heck.<br/>It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!
You son of a bitch.
So, he hooked up with Shelly?<br/>You must've been pissed.
Damn straight.
Barney, I've had Shelly<br/>set aside for Ted for three years.
Dude, Ted was not missing out.
She's brainy and annoying,
kind of boring in the sack.
I guess she would've<br/>been perfect for Ted.
Had I known that<br/>she was there to meet Ted,
of course I wouldn't have done it,<br/>but...
Given the circumstances,<br/>I think Ted'll be proud of me.
I pulled off<br/>"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."
Okay, what's the<br/>Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
My question exactly.
- What's the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?<br/>- Glad you asked.
To perform the<br/>Lorenzo Von Matterhorn,
here's what you'll need:<br/>basic knowledge of web site design
and a very unique fake name.
So, think of your fake name<br/>right now.
Have you got it? Good.
Now, select your target.
Preferably a girl<br/>with a real nice...
Phone.
Yeah, it's me.
Do I know you?
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Are you, like, famous or something?
You really don't know<br/>who I am, do you?
What a refreshing change of pace.
Nice to meet you...
Once again,<br/>I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Spelled like it sounds, two "t"s.
Ciao.
Then, as soon as you're gone,<br/>she gets out her phone
and does an internet search<br/>for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
And that's when she discovers...
A series of fake web sites,
all devoted to the incredible life
of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
There's the fake business article<br/>about him, the reclusive billionaire.
The fake explorers club<br/>newsletter describing
his balloon trek to the north pole as<br/>a feat of pure daring and imagination.
The fake medical journal featuring<br/>the heartbreaking story of doctors
telling him penis reduction surgery<br/>isn't an option.
And by the time you get back...
Hi, Shelly, I hate to be forward,
but can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Please.
What does coffee go<br/>for these days, $50?
And it is on.
That's awful.
You realize you broke<br/>her heart, right?
She's inconsolable.
Why would she be inconsolable?
Lorenzo's balloon won't disappear<br/>over the arctic for another week.
She would be upset only if someone<br/>told her it was a bunch of lies.
- It was all just a bunch of lies?<br/>- It was all just a bunch of lies.
- The balloon expedition?<br/>- Lies!
The man-made island shaped<br/>like his face off the coast of Dubai?
- Lies!<br/>- Finishing 3 in laser tag competion?
Li... actually, that one's true.<br/>I went to that.
- You went to the Vatican?<br/>- Lies!
Oh, my god!
Well, I hope<br/>you're happy with yourself.
- What?<br/>- You broke that girl's heart.
- Me?<br/>- You!
She'll probably never<br/>trust a guy again.
You ruined her for Ted.
Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn,
Lorenzo's twin brother.
Can you believe that?<br/>He blames me!
And by the way, Ted,<br/>I bet she'd still go out with you.
Let me think. Do I want to go out with<br/>a girl Barney hooked up with?
Guys, help me out with<br/>the harmonies.
- Hell no...<br/>- Hell no...
You must be a<br/>little bothered by this.
It's his life.
If these girls are dumb<br/>enough to fall for this crap,
- they have it coming.<br/>- Agreed.
Have you seen<br/>the one in there labeled "the SNASA"?
You're an astronaut?
I'm actually<br/>in a top secret government space program
called secret NASA
or SNASA.
SNASA.
Do you go to the moon?
Well, not the moon you're familiar with,<br/>though I have been to the...
smoon.
The smoon.
If you fall for that one,<br/>my heart breaks for you,
but I'm sorry, you're a smoron.
So, what happens next?
Well...
Come on, Barney, you just...
You just got out<br/>of an honest to God relationship.
You're a real boy now.
You can't go back<br/>to these cheap tricks.
Cheap tricks?!
Not one of these is a cheap trick.
Except for "the Cheap Trick".
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.
And even that one involves<br/>expensive hair extensions.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm off to prepare<br/>for tonight's main event.
I will be performing<br/>"the he's not coming".
Glad you asked.
To perform "the he's not coming",<br/>here's what you'll need,
the observation deck<br/>of the Empire State Building.
Are you up there?
Good.
For generations, this has been<br/>the spot New Yorkers have chosen
for their romantic reunions<br/>with long-estranged lovers,
so all you have to do is walk up<br/>to every girl you see and say...
He's not coming.
- What are you talking about?<br/>- Never mind.
He's not coming.
He's not coming.
She's not coming?
Sorry.
Until sooner or later...
He's not coming.
He's not?
But we agreed.
We always said we'd meet here.
On this night.
I'm such a fool.
I'm going to go get the paper.
- More like, go get a husband.<br/>- Totally.
You guys need to stop that,<br/>seriously.
The last thing I am looking<br/>for right now is a relationship.
When you pick up newspaper, be sure<br/>to check the wedding announcements.
For yours.
Robin, it's like this.
Do you have any idea<br/>how many times I've gone to the freezer
looking for frozen waffles<br/>and not found them?
- Thousands?<br/>- Millions.
But when I go to the freezer<br/>looking for a popsicle...
Or the remote control<br/>because we are having a fight
and she's hidden it there...<br/>You know what I find?
Frozen waffles.<br/>That's how it works.
You go out there looking for a paper,<br/>you're coming back with frozen waffles.
And, in this case,<br/>frozen waffles is a guy.
Also,
could you pick up<br/>some frozen waffles?
In that case, frozen waffles...
are frozen waffles.
Guys, code red!<br/>Emergency.
Lockdown.<br/>Nobody's leaving.
- What happened?<br/>- I tried the "he's not coming",
and it worked.<br/>Gangbusters.
You should have seen this girl.
I'm leaving.
We get up to my place, and I go<br/>into my room to set up the camera...
To light the candles...
And when I come out,
she's gone, and so is the playbook!
I think we all know<br/>who is responsible for this.
We do.
Al-Qaeda.
You idiot.
It was me.
You son of a bitch.
You stole the playbook?
So,<br/>the girl on the Empire State Building?
A friend of mine, an actress.
An actress.
Of course.
That explains her impeccable diction<br/>and her sluttiness.
Barney, I've got half a mind<br/>to take that playbook
and put it up on the internet<br/>for the whole world to see.
- You wouldn't.<br/>- I won't,
as long as you agree<br/>to no more scams,
no more cons, no more hustles,<br/>no more hoodwinks,
no more gambits, no more stratagems<br/>and no more bamboozles.
- I notice you left out flimflams.<br/>- No flimflams!
Damn it.
My God.
I'm sorry to interrupt,<br/>but look at this.
I got left at the altar.
My god, that's horrible.
I wonder if that would work.
That's not even<br/>the worst one in here.
Have you guys seen<br/>"my penis grants wishes"?
Really?
- A genie comes out of it?<br/>- Only if you rub it hard enough.
- So, then, what happened?<br/>- It says here he breaks into song,
and then the furniture comes to life<br/>and dances with him.
It's not very well thought out.<br/>It's no "Mrs. Stinsfire".
What happened in real life?
Well, a few hours later...
I heard it was gonna rain.
If anyone's interested,<br/>I will be at MacLaren's pub
performing a play out of the Playbook<br/>entitled "The Scuba Diver".
That is all.
That's it.
I'm putting the Playbook up<br/>on the internet.
Can you put the Playbook<br/>up on the internet?
Of course, baby,<br/>but here's the weird thing.
I have literally been through this book<br/>cover to cover.
There is no play<br/>called "The Scuba Diver".
So, now you guys want to know<br/>what "The Scuba Diver" is.
Well,
it was on the last page<br/>of the Playbook,
but I ripped it out just in case.
Don't worry.<br/>You're about to see it in action.
See this blond?
Tizzarget acquizzired.
- Barney, don't do this.<br/>- Give it a rest, pest.
If anyone should be mad,<br/>should be Robin.
- She loves the Playbook.<br/>- I don't love the Playbook.
What are you talk...
The Playbook, it's gold.<br/>You gotta admit it's spectacular.
Look, Barney, we just broke up.
I mean, the costumes are cute but...
We just broke up.
I didn't know you felt that way.
I guess I've been so wrapped up<br/>in my own stuff that I...
Crap, she's looking over here.<br/>Quick, everyone, scatter.
That's it.
You see that guy over there<br/>in the scuba suit?
And that brings us to right now.
But... Wait.
So, why is he wearing scuba gear?
We don't know.
And it's killing us, Claire.<br/>It's killing us!
Let's go ask him.
So, what's "The Scuba Diver"?
And this is Claire, by the way.
I'm Lieutenant Frank Lyman.
I train bomb sniffing dolphins<br/>for the balt...
You know what?
I can't do this.
I am so sorry.
This breakup's been tougher on me<br/>than I thought.
This Playbook was just a way<br/>to take my mind off of things.
It's okay.<br/>It's been tough on me, too.
I mean, look at me.<br/>I've sworn off relationships.
- She getting married.<br/>- Gotta work on my toast.
Gotta make sure my tux fits.
I will bang your heads together<br/>like coconuts.
I'm so glad you're stopping this.
And, frankly,
the real Barney is way cooler
than any of the fake Barneys<br/>in this Playbook.
Is that right?
Claire, you've probably heard a lot<br/>about the real Barney tonight.
- Want to grab a cup of coffee?<br/>- Claire, before you turn him down,
I think you should know
that under this neoprene suit
with what appears to be a tube sock<br/>stuffed in the crotch...
- Can of Pringles, but go on.<br/>- ... is an amazing guy.
He's fun and one of my best friends.
And he landed this hottie.
He's a good guy.
- Come on, go out with him.<br/>- It's just a cup of coffee, right?
All right. Let's get some coffee.
And by the end of the night...
I'm proud of him.
To be that vulnerable<br/>takes a lot of Pringles.
I got a text from Barney.
"Look under the table."
It's a page from the Playbook.
What does it say?
It's "The Scuba Diver".
One: tell a meddlesome female friend<br/>about the Playbook.
Two: run a play on one of her coworkers,<br/>making her so angry she steals it.
Three:
put on the scuba suit and tell her<br/>you gonna do "The Scuba Diver"
on the hot girl standing by the bar.<br/>Your friend, let's call her Lily...
talks to the girl<br/>and tells her everything about the book.
Here's where it gets tricky.<br/>When they ask what "The Scuba Diver" is,
take off your mask, give them spiel<br/>about your deep-seated insecurities
which don't exist,<br/>because you're awesome.
Then, Lily talks you up to the girl<br/>who agrees to go get coffee with you.
And it...
is...
on.
You son of a bitch.
I'll give you a call.
All right. Bye-bye.
For those of you keeping score,<br/>"The Ted Mosby" works.
Here we go.<br/>You say you don't want a relationship.
The love of your life<br/>is about to walk through the door
and it's...
that guy.
- I'm not falling in love with that guy.<br/>- Right, because it's going to be...
That guy.
I don't know. The blue blazer's<br/>just not doing it for me...
You're right, It's that guy!
You should give her a chance.
Make out with her a little,<br/>see if there's something there.
- I'm going to work.<br/>- Yeah, you are.
I'm actually gonna work.
- Go, work it.<br/>- And the ironic part was...
Robin?
- Don, your new cohost.<br/>- That was the day she met Don.
Damn it, Marshall.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In November 2009,
Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily<br/>hosted the first Thanksgiving{\at their very own apartment}.
Marshall had found<br/>the perfect turkey.
Baby, it is beautiful.
It's 22 pounds.<br/>It's organic.
Remember my bald Uncle Heinrek?<br/>It looks exactly like his head.
My turkey...
So, when we showed up for the big day,<br/>Marshall was pretty bummed out.
Well, we got the turkey.
You didn't.<br/>You got the pathetic replacement turkey.
Damn it, why didn't I listen<br/>to the precorded voice
of former mayor Ed Koch<br/>reminding me to take my belongings?
- You don't understand.<br/>- We went to the port authority{\ lost and found},
and there,<br/>sitting in their fridge...
Is this your turkey?
That's my turkey!
Come here,<br/>you handsome little bastard!
I'm gonna go put this in the oven.
You are the best friends ever!
It was totally a team effort.
I don't know what to say.<br/>It's Thanksgiving,
but thanks doesn't seem like enough.
You would've done<br/>the same thing for us.
I would, and you know why?<br/>Because I love you.
I'm going to show you just how much.
I bequeath unto you
the fourth slap.
What?
Kids, you remember<br/>Barney and Marshall's "slap bet".
When Barney lost, Marshall won the right<br/>to slap Barney five times
as hard as he could.<br/>So far, he'd used three slaps.
With the third being doled out<br/>exactly two years earlier
on Thanksgiving day 2007.
A day that history came to know<br/>as "Slapsgiving".
- Are you saying...<br/>- What we think you're saying?
Probably not.
Unless you think I'm saying
"Slapsgiving two:<br/>revenge of the slap",
in which case, yes,<br/>that's exactly what I'm saying!
No way!
- Slaps aren't transferable.<br/>- Lily is the slap bet commissioner.
Slaps are transferable.
You realize you'll only have<br/>one left after this.
Are you sure<br/>you want to spend this slap today?
Life is short.<br/>I figured, Slap-e Diem.
Rule number one:<br/>the slap must occur before sundown,
so as not to interfere<br/>with Lily's meal.
Two, you have to decide<br/>who gets to do it.
Three...<br/>We're going to tie barney to this chair,
which shall henceforth be referred<br/>to as the slapping throne.
Sound fair?
- Totally.<br/>- Absolutely not!
It was all set to be<br/>the best Thanksgiving ever.
Until...
Are we expecting somebody else?
It was someone Lily hadn't seen<br/>or spoken to in three years.
Dad.
Synchro : -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
{\pub}Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey,<br/>had always had a tough relationship.
Mickey's dream was to invent<br/>the next great American board game.
But his ideas were a little off.
Daddy?
You missed my ballet recital.
{\pos(192,210)}Yes, but, look!
{\pos(192,210)}I just put the finishing touches<br/>on my new, hit board game,
"Tijuana Slumlord".
{\pos(192,210)}You missed my gymnastics meet.
But this is the one!
"Car Battery:
"how long can you hold on?"
Grab these.
I had a nightmare.
{\pos(192,210)}Here, come play daddy's new game:
"There's a clown demon<br/>under the bed!"
Her whole life,<br/>Mickey disappointed Lily.
And she put up with it,
until one day in 2006
when Lily went to visit<br/>her grandparents.
So, Rita, are you excited<br/>about the big move to Florida?
{\pos(192,190)}Actually, slight change of plans.
{\pos(192,190)}We're staying here<br/>for the time being.
{\pos(192,210)}We had a slight financial hiccup.
{\pos(192,210)}The straw to my juice box broke!
{\pos(192,210)}- What a pleasant surprise.<br/>- What happened to your apartment?
I had a little falling out<br/>with my roommate.
{\pos(192,210)}- What happened?<br/>- He wanted me to pay rent.
{\pos(192,210)}Got kind of ugly.
{\pos(192,210)}You should be paying rent,<br/>not living in your parents' basement.
I{\pos(192,210)}t's not my first choice.
{\pos(192,210)}Having the old farts right upstairs<br/>is crimpin' my style a bit.
{\pos(192,210)}Clearly, they're not getting<br/>the whole "sock on the doorknob" thing.
{\pos(192,210)}- They caught you with a girl?<br/>- In a way.
I'm off to work.
{\pos(192,210)}- You're retired.<br/>- Now I have an extra mouth to feed,
{\pos(192,210)}I had to go back to the steel mill.
Where's my truss?
{\pos(192,210)}So, not only did you stop them<br/>from moving to Florida,
{\pos(192,210)}but now you forced Grandpa<br/>to go back to work?
{\pos(192,210)}Just until I get Aldrin Games<br/>unlimited off the ground
with my new sensation:
"Dog Fight Promoter".
{\pos(192,210)}Lily gave her dad a look that Marshall<br/>had only seen a few times before.
A look we all prayed never to be<br/>on the receiving end of:
her "you're dead to me" look.
Which brings us<br/>back to Thanksgiving of 2009.
I brought "Diseases"!
- Why is he here?<br/>- Dunno.
But we should let him in<br/>and find out.
No, I don't want to see him!<br/>Get rid of him!
{\pos(192,210)}Just hang tight, okay?<br/>We'll, we'll work this out.
Take your time, amigo.<br/>I'm okay as long as I have "diseases"!
The fun's infectious.
- God, I hope Lily's okay.<br/>- Me, too.
She doesn't talk about it much,<br/>but this thing causes her a lot of pain.
Just tell me which one of you<br/>is gonna slap me!
- What?<br/>- I'm dying over here!
Ted reaches for a chip, I flinch!<br/>Robin fixes her hair, I flinch!
I'm doing so much flinching.<br/>It's bad for my skin.
I'm getting crow's feet.<br/>Crow's feet!
Lily, it's been three years, okay?<br/>That's long enough.
Having him in my life<br/>causes me nothing but stress.
It's just easier for him<br/>to be dead to me.
I supported you when our neighbor,<br/>Mr. Ossias, was "dead to you".
- That's our newspaper.<br/>- You'll get it back in 15 minutes.
Make it 20.<br/>I had a steak last night.
And I was fine when your bridesmaid,<br/>Whitney, was "dead to you".
You look so amazing!
That dress is gorgeous!
Thanks, guys.
I'm just not a fan of strapless.
I even understood when Mr. Park<br/>{\*from the bodega downstairs }was "dead to you."
One coffee, please.
But only if you have decaf.<br/>I don't want to be up all night.
Dollar fifty.
- Coffee, regular.<br/>- Dollar fifty.
Excuse me.<br/>Are you sure mine was decaf?
You just used the same pot.
I lie to him. Okay?
You son of a bitch.
That was not decaf!
I supported you<br/>with all of those random people,
but this is your father.
Can't we at least<br/>just give him some turkey?
Come on.
Please, I can't ask the guy<br/>to leave on Thanksgiving.
You don't have to ask.
Just tell him that it's really important<br/>that he be here.
And before you know it,<br/>he'll be at a game convention in Toledo,
giving your braces money to some guy<br/>claiming to be Milton Bradley.
He was just out<br/>trying to provide for the family.
No, that's what my mom did<br/>by working two jobs.
That man broke my heart<br/>every single day for 20 years.
Well, then we'll just give him<br/>some dark meat.
No, seriously, Robin,<br/>you should get the slap.
You're a great slapper.
In fact, I want to study slapping<br/>under your tutelage.
I want to be your slap-prentice.
Don't sell yourself short there.<br/>You're a slapping rock star.
Your name should be Eric Slapton.
This is torture.<br/>Just put me in the chair...
- Slapping throne.<br/>- And get it over with!
- He's all yours.<br/>- It's you, I insist.
- Okay, I'll do it.<br/>- Wait, what?
I'll slap him.
What, so that's just, like,<br/>the end of the discussion?
You said I could slap him.
I was just being nice.
If anyone's gonna slap him,<br/>it's gonna be me.
No, it's not.
This is interesting.
Lily, he's family, okay?
And I'm sorry,<br/>but you just don't cut off family.
That's easy for you to say
when you come from the most<br/>ridiculously close family in the world.
We are not ridiculously close.
Really?
What about the Eriksen family dinner<br/>every single sunday?
Everything looks delicious,<br/>Mother Eriksen.
Thank you, Papa Oear.
Would you say grace?
Well, I would be happy to, mother.
Everyone, please join hands.
Dear Lord...
I'm sorry, but that's weird.
A family should be that close.
{\And }I want our future family to be {\that }close.<br/>And that includes your dad.
I can't believe<br/>you're taking his side.
Let me be clear on this.
That man will never cross
the threshold into this home, ever!
It's just gonna be,<br/>like, five more minutes.
Hopefully soon, amigo.
I'm fighting a losing battle<br/>with hemorrhoids here.
That's one of the diseases?
Ted, there is an hour<br/>before the sun sets,
at which point,<br/>neither one{\ of us} gets to slap Barney.
So just let me have it.
I{\'m the one who } had the idea to call<br/>the port authority lost and found.
That's a good point.<br/>Rebuttal?
- I'm the one who slipped the guy a 20!<br/>- Philosophical conundrum.
Idea versus execution.<br/>Please discuss at length.
I carried that huge turkey<br/>all the way up here.
I paid for cab fare.
{\Well, }You slept<br/>with one of my best friends!
What?
- You said you were okay with that.<br/>- {\Well, }I'm not!
{\Well, }Why didn't you say<br/>something at the time?
Because I'm still in love with you!
Do you really want<br/>to slap Barney so bad
you would lie<br/>about being in love with me?
I really want to slap him{\, okay?}!
Your dad has made<br/>some mistakes in the past,
but he's a different person now.
He's {\moved }out of your grandparents' house.<br/>He's got a job.
He's paying off his IRS debts.
{\Wait, }How do you know all that?
{\Like, }Body language.
We met for a drink last week.
I miss her a ton.
Little princess.
She ever talk about me?
Like, all the time.
She tells<br/>this one really sweet story about...
- So never?<br/>- Not a word.
But...<br/>It doesn't have to be that way.
We can fix this, right?
You know, I always thought<br/>it'd get fixed at the wedding.
I even wrote a toast.
But then, no invite.
Hell, I haven't even seen<br/>a wedding photo.
And then, right before my eyes,
your father broke down crying.
That's it!
You're coming to Thanksgiving!
You invited him?
The guy was, like, blubbering.<br/>What was I going to do?
{\And }Then, some jerk at the next table<br/>called him a sissy
which I thought<br/>was totally uncalled-for.
I can't believe you.<br/>{\Marshall, }What gives you the right to do that?
You and I are married.
And that means he's my family, too.{\pub}
Ted, you better roll quickly.
Your gall bladder's about to burst.
{\You know, }Mickey, it's been{\, like,} half an hour.<br/>I think we should go look for Lily.
She just needs some time to cool down.<br/>Let's finish the game.
{\pos(192,220)}Play another round.<br/>Best of seven!
{\pos(192,220)}Damn it, Robin!<br/>I've known Barney the longest.
{\pos(192,220)}I get to slap him.
{\pos(192,220)}That slap is mine, Mosby.
{\pos(192,220)}I've never slapped Barney...
above the waist.
{\Look, }I've wanted to slap Barney<br/>since the moment I met him!
You don't think<br/>that I want to slap Barney?
Wait a minute!
This slap was supposed to be<br/>a wonderful thing, a gift,
and...
it's turned us against each other.
My God, you're right.
This once pure fruit has turned<br/>into a poison slapple.
You know what?<br/>Seriously, you take it.
Are you sure?
Slapsolutely.
I really think<br/>that we should go look for Lily.
Gall bladder about to pop.
It's decided. Barney, come on.<br/>Get in the throne.
Are you...
Come on.
Well, I guess that is the...
best decision, Robin.<br/>I mean...
Men are stronger than women.
Don't listen to him.<br/>It's been decided.
And that's what<br/>you've always wanted, isn't it{\, robin}?
A strong man to take care of you?
I mean, sure.<br/>Growing up, you were a scrapper.
Playing hockey with the boys,
skinning your knees on the ice.
But what you couldn't tell<br/>your teammates...
What you couldn't<br/>even tell yourself...
was that all you really wanted...
was that pretty white dress...
in that pretty white chapel.
And at the end of that center aisle,
strewn with pretty white flowers,
a man to do<br/>all your slapping for you.
Let me at him!
- What just happened?<br/>- Sorry, Ted.
Gallbladder burst.
You move back three spaces.
You come in here,
and you watch your daughter leave,<br/>and you don't even care.
And now<br/>you've destroyed Thanksgiving dinner!
Lily worked all day on this!
Relax. It's not real bile.
It's just lead-based paint<br/>from China.
And horse bile.
And at that moment,
Marshall gave Mickey a look
none of us had ever seen him<br/>give anyone.
- What's this? What's he doing?<br/>- Did you swallow some of that paint?
This is my "you're dead to me" look.
{\You know,}Lily's is so much better...
Get out of my house!
Mr. Park's? This is the last place<br/>I expected to find you.
I'm sorry.
But just hear me out.
I used to think<br/>that family was a right.
But it's not. It's a privilege,<br/>and it has to be earned.
I kicked your dad out.
And I promise, baby,<br/>I will never make you see him again.
What?
Baby, what happened?
Marshall,<br/>I came in here because it was cold
and this was the only place<br/>that was open.
I wasn't even gonna look Mr. Park<br/>in the eye.
And then I found out...
Mr. Park died.
He really is dead to me!
And if I feel this bad<br/>about never making up with Mr. Park,
a guy who meant<br/>literally nothing to me...
We got to go get my dad.
So that's how on Thanksgiving 2009,
your aunt Lily performed a miracle.
She brought a man<br/>back from the dead.
Everyone.
Before we get started, Barney,
we're going to need you<br/>on the slapping throne.
Slap bet commissioner, surely tying me<br/>to a chair is a breach...
Less yappin', more slappin'.
Ted, Robin.<br/>It's two minutes until sundown.
Have you {\guys }decided which one of you
is going to get<br/>to slap Barney right in his face?
It's gonna be Ted.
What? Why me?
Last year,<br/>you got left at the altar.
You lost your job.
But you've come<br/>such a long way since then.
I'm so proud of you, Ted.
You deserve<br/>to slap someone in his face,
as hard as you can.
Thanks.
This is the worst.
Mama!
You {\just }went through<br/>your {\own }breakup, and...
While I know you and Barney<br/>left it on good terms, isn't there...
some part of you, deep down,
that wants to slap him<br/>right in his face?
There is.
I know there is.
This is basically hell on earth.
All right.
It hurts!
I can't do it.
I can't take this from you, Ted.
No or I, you.
Thank God.
So, I'd like to make a gesture.
No way!
I'm glad you and Lily<br/>are trying to work things out.
So, to welcome you<br/>to our little family...
I'd like to offer you this slap.
Really?
Well, I feel a little weird.
I just met barney,
and I don't have anything<br/>against the guy, but...
how often do you get a chance<br/>to slap someone right in his face?
Soft!
I'm sorry.<br/>I can't do it.
Thank God.
Lily...
{\I know }I haven't been much<br/>of a father to you.
You are kidding me.
So for all the ballet recitals<br/>{\that }I missed,
for all the art shows<br/>that I should've been at...
for the wedding gift<br/>{\that }I never got a chance to give to you...
Princess...
I give this slap...
to you.
She is the slap bet commissioner.<br/>She's supposed to remain impartial!
Slap bet commissioner says<br/>it's okay.
This is not good.
Please.
Let me...
Just close your eyes.<br/>It'll be over soon.
Running through a meadow.
I can't do it.
Why can't I do it?
Because...
this slap has done<br/>exactly what I hoped.
It's brought us all closer together.
And it's caused us to recognize
both the frailty and the greatness
in ourselves
and each other.
Give me a break.
And that is why...
There will be no slap today.
This is the best Thanksgiving...
That's four!
So, turkey?
From Aldrin games unlimited, it's...<br/>Slap Bet!
The slap-happy game<br/>that's a real hit.
You just got slapped,
across the face, my friend...
For kids of all ages.
You just got slapped,
that really just happened...
Everybody saw it,
everybody laughed and clapped,
- 'cause it was awesome...<br/>- I win!
The way that you just got slapped.
Slap yourself silly with Slap Bet,<br/>the happy hitting game from Aldrin.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Well...
got another one.
- Boy.<br/>- What's in the box?
What's in the box?<br/>What's in the box?
What's in the box?!
Right?
Brad Pitt... Seven?
Nothing?
Yeah, I'm the jerk.
What's in the box?
Since Marshall<br/>and Lily got their own place,
his mom keeps sending them boxes<br/>of his stuff she's trying to get rid of.
Thanks, Mom.<br/>You really nailed it this time.
I really needed He-Man's right arm
and this old book of Mad Libs.
"Fart went to the fart<br/>to fart fartly."
That's nice.
That's good stuff.
Thanks, Mom.
The window is open.
- What?<br/>- The window is open.
The window is open.
What are you waiting for?<br/>Run, Ted, run!
Lily, the window is open.
Make a hole, people.
Run, Ted, run!
I was just...
you know...<br/>How are you?
I'm fine, I guess.
Actually, no, I'm not fine.
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
You want to hang out tonight?
Sure.
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-
.:: La Fabrique ::.
- So fun. You guys liked it.<br/>- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.<br/>- I got in the window.
What is going on?<br/>What is the window?
You know how everyone has that guy<br/>or girl who, no matter what happens,
you always rember them<br/>being the perfect one for you?
- Mike Schatz.<br/>- Lily.
That girl right over there.
Well, that girl for me was,<br/>and still is...
- Maggie Wilks.<br/>- We all went to college together.
She was awesome.<br/>Everybody loved her.
I think I know what<br/>we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
- She was...<br/>- The ultimate girl next door.
She was the ultimate girl next door.<br/>Still is.
Every guy who meets Maggie<br/>falls madly in love with her.
And that's the problem.<br/>Since I've known her,
she's only been single for, like,
three brief windows of opportunity.
When she moved here and broke up<br/>with her boyfriend, I waited a month.
You know, so I wouldn't<br/>be the rebound guy.
Well, the rebound guy<br/>lasted two years.
After they broke up,<br/>I only waited a week.
I was still too late.
She dated that guy for three years.
The next time,<br/>I wasn't messing around.
I was at her door not one hour<br/>after they broke up.
The only thing she did
between becoming single
and the moment I got there was<br/>go downstairs and check her mail.
I was still too late.
And she dated that guy<br/>for four years.
I wasn't going to let this happen again,<br/>so I begged her neighbor, Mrs. Douglas,
to call me the second<br/>she and David broke up.
And now, a very single<br/>and available Maggie Wilks
is on her way to this very spot.
I sent a cab with a female driver,<br/>so she'd have
no other interaction with a man<br/>until she got to me.
Where she'll still have<br/>no interaction with a man.
What up?
I feel good tonight.<br/>Tonight's going to be good.
Hell, yeah!
It's my overalls.
I wore these babies all throughout<br/>high school. These were my jam.
God, you really were a virgin<br/>before you met Lily, weren't you?
- That's unnecessary.<br/>- She's right, baby.
If you had worn<br/>these things in college,
even I wouldn't have slept with you.
And, if you recall,<br/>I was good to go.
No one...<br/>I mean no one...
could get laid wearing these.
Challenge accepted.
I, Barney Stinson,
being of sound mind<br/>and amazing body,
will wear these overalls<br/>until I have sex with a woman.
I actually dated that guy.
Quick game plan.
Maggie shows up, couple minutes<br/>of hugs and hi's,
and then everybody's out of here.<br/>This is my one shot.
I am not gonna screw this up.
- Who'd you get to cover your class?<br/>- Crap!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my goodness.
Stranger.<br/>Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin.
- Nice to meet you.<br/>- Nice to meet you, too.
I totally forgot,<br/>I have to teach a class tonight.
Want to come with me and check out<br/>a real "elive architecture class?
Not even a little bit.
You know, I'll just hang here<br/>with Marshall. It'll be fun.
Fantastic.
Well, have a seat.<br/>Relax.
Yeah, this is casual.
This is all very, very, very casual.
You want me to find the perfect girl<br/>so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
Do not let any guy near her, okay?<br/>That means no waiter takes her order,
no busboy clears her table.<br/>If she bursts into flames,
I want a firewoman putting her out.
I don't think 911 takes requests.
Damn it, Marshall!<br/>Whatever you have to do,
keep Maggie Wilks single<br/>until I get back.
I left my tab open.<br/>Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?<br/>- Target secure.
Oh, my gosh.<br/>How weird.
We all walked out of the bathroom<br/>at the same time.
Let's all walk back<br/>to the booth together.
Oh, my.
Look at this, the table<br/>where we are sitting.
Back off!
Okay, not that I care<br/>about this challenge,
but it's cheating to wear<br/>overalls over a suit.
No, it's not. They're not called<br/>over T-shirts, Robin.
They're not called over shirtless fat<br/>guys who used to come fix my mom's car
and then hang out with her<br/>upstairs for a little while.
They're called overalls, okay?
And I can wear them over<br/>whatever I want.
He's not saying hello.
He's just telling you<br/>what he feeds his horsies.
Man, I can sit here and make<br/>you-look-like-a-farmer jokes
all night.<br/>Challenge accepted.
Good evening. Tonight, we're gonna have<br/>a nice, quick class on bridges.
There are 6 types: Beam, cantilever,<br/>arch, suspension, and 2 others.
You got land on both sides, water<br/>in the middle. See you all next week.
We get you for the whole hour.
Come on. <br/>Who really wants to sit here
and listen to me yap about bridges?
Really?
I just thought about<br/>how awesome Ted is again.
This is a weird drinking game.
Can I buy you a drink?
He's got a big brown jug<br/>with three X's on it.
What have I done?
One very important thing<br/>to keep in mind
when designing a bridge...
I mean, yes.
Yes, when you're designing a bridge,<br/>always rember:
make adjustments...
... go get it energized.
That's good advice for life, too.
So, Professor Mosby,
is this Maggie someone special?
She's just this girl I've been<br/>into for a really long time,
and, tonight could be the one chance<br/>I have to go out with her, so...
Is she a hottie?
Yes, Jamie.<br/>She's very attractive.
And if we can just<br/>end class right now...
Maggie may finally be available,<br/>but what about you, Professor Mosby?
Are you ready<br/>for a serious relationship?
Totally.
I mean, I think so.
Maybe.
I don't know.<br/>What do you guys think?
Oh, my gosh.<br/>I totally forgot about this.
- What is it?<br/>- It's a homework assignment
from when I was 15.
Write a letter<br/>to your 30-year-old self
with a list of goals<br/>you hope to achieve.
Dear Future Me.
First off,<br/>you'd better be driving either
a kick-ass Camaro or the A-Team van.
That's priority numero uno.
And by now your rat tail should<br/>hang down to your freakin' knees.
You can still slam-dunk, obviously,
and you've legally changed<br/>your name to "Vanilla Thunder."
Your wife...<br/>let me break it down:
blonde, six feet tall,
has an awesome rack and caters<br/>to your every need.
- Sorry, babe.<br/>- That's OK.
You just described your mother.
Keep going.
You're still rocking... you're still<br/>rocking the stone-washed overalls,
because this look is working.
And most importantly,
you'd better be saving the world.
If you became some lame,<br/>corporate sellout,
just throw yourself off a cliff
because you suck.
And I licky boom-boom down.
Yeah, hilarious.
I became a lame, corporate sellout.
I work for GNB, the most evil bank<br/>in the history of the world.
Come on, Vanilla Thunder, everyone's<br/>got to grow up and get a real job.
Yeah, I remember back<br/>in college Maggie wanted to be
a marine biologist by day and mentor
inner-city kids by night.
Those things.
Baby, where are you going?
I gotta do something at work.
It won't take long.
What's up with him?
I think he's going to quit his job.
I'm sorry, Maggie.<br/>I gotta go stop him.
Ted, I had to leave the bar,<br/>but it's okay.
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
- I've got things under control.<br/>- You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like<br/>a super-powered man magnet.
I know a little something<br/>about man magnets.
Your friend may be<br/>one of those magnets
that can hold up a picture of your kids<br/>on the fridge,
but I'm one of those magnets<br/>that can pick up cars in a junkyard.
Who's this?
Jim, a good friend of mine<br/>from work.
Nice to meet you.
What does being "ready" even mean?
I thought I was "ready" last year.<br/>I wound up getting left at the altar.
I'll be honest, guys.
I'm a little scared.
Louis, then Betty.
We're all scared, Professor Mosby.
Doesn't being scared let you know<br/>you're on to something important?
I mean, if you're not scared,<br/>you're not taking a chance.
And if you're not taking a chance,<br/>then what the hell are you doing?
Right?
You're ready, bro.
Jim, you are so funny.
Funny? I think he's hilarious.
In fact, I laughed so hard,<br/>I think I may have just peed my pants.
I'd better take off.
To the opening of a photography exhibit<br/>they were talking about at work:
Les Chiens Erotique.
- I have an extra ticket...<br/>- Me?!
I'd love to!
All right, I gotta go.
One last piece of advice.
Make adjustments...
Go get it energized!
- Ted, change of plans.<br/>- You left her with Barney?!
Ted, will you take it easy?
- I'm your bro.<br/>- You're an animal.
And even though our bro-lationship<br/>has suffered its setbacks in this area,
I assure you I will be<br/>the perfect gentleman.
Thanks.
I really like those overalls.
You have ten minutes<br/>or the window's closing.
Ten minutes?
Because we're bros.
While I was racing through New York,<br/>trying to get back to the bar,
your Aunt Robin was doing her best<br/>to keep Jim away from Maggie.
Wanna go back to the bar<br/>and see if Maggie's still there?
No way!<br/>I love erotic dog photography.
Did you see the one over there<br/>of the corgies doing it people style?
I'll get us a taxi.<br/>I feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.
Let's have a glass of wine first.
Look how filthy I am.
I am just a...
a filthy, filthy girl
who would totally go to second base<br/>with a guy as a favor to a friend.
You like that?
I'm going to call Maggie,<br/>see what she's doing.
Give it a rest, jeez!<br/>She's hanging out with Ted tonight.
Ted? What about David?
They broke up.
Maggie's single?
That doesn't sound familiar.
Can I help wipe that off?
Please?
I hate Barney Stinson!
Me, too!
Lily finally got to GNB,<br/>but the place was deserted.
Thought you came here to quit your job.<br/>I forgot about the hoop.
I thought if I could just do<br/>one thing in that letter,
I wouldn't feel like<br/>such an old sellout,
- so I came out here to dunk.<br/>- Did it make you feel better?
I barely grazed<br/>the bottom of the net,
and now my legs hurt so bad,<br/>I can't even fall down.
I'm gonna.
How could you?
I challenged myself<br/>to get laid wearing overalls.
And if you stand in my way,<br/>then you're letting Barney win.
You don't want that. That son of a bitch<br/>will never let us hear the end.
Thank God.<br/>Maggie...
Where do you think you're going?
- To tell that girl I love her.<br/>- Get in line, bub.
I'll have sex with her,<br/>then he'll tell her he loves her,
and then you can do whatever you want.<br/>Do we agree on the order?
Mister!
You just missed out<br/>on the night of your life.
The night...
of your life.
- I've been in love for five years.<br/>- I've been love for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls<br/>for an hour and a half.
Maybe you can't dunk anymore.
But you've achieved more<br/>in your 30 years
than that 15-year-old dweeb<br/>could ever dream of.
You put yourself<br/>through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense<br/>to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And...
you married a smoking-hot chick<br/>who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you<br/>an entire foot closer to dunking.
There you go, Vanilla Thunder.
Step back.
How about instead of dunking,<br/>we go up to your office,
and you lie very still<br/>while I go bananas all over you?
Could we maybe instead<br/>just do it right here?
Sure, baby.
She loves me!
We have to figure this out.
We're dealing<br/>with a small window of opportunity.
If you let me in there,
that window's gonna open up again<br/>in ten minutes.
Wait, where's Maggie?
She's gone.<br/>I sent her home.
You were like vultures fighting.<br/>Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!<br/>- Robin, how could you?
No, she's right.
Maggie deserves<br/>some time to herself.
Nobody likes to be alone,<br/>especially after a breakup,
but that's when we discover<br/>who we really are and...
what we really want.
She deserves that.
And kids, I meant that.
Which is why I'm not proud of<br/>what happened next.
It's around the corner.
Sorry.<br/>Class ran a little...
- Who's this?<br/>- This is Adam.
It's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.<br/>We haven't seen each other since...
A long time.
And then Maggie Wilks told us
the second-greatest love story<br/>I've ever heard.
I just moved to town<br/>and I had to look her up.
I guess<br/>we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Of course.
So, kids,
I missed out<br/>on the ultimate girl next door...
to the guy next door.
See you next time.
There was no "next time".
Maggie's window never opened again.
I got it!
That country bar, Giddy-Ups!<br/>The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-Ups.
I want that.
I forgot what it feels like<br/>to chase the real thing, but...
I think I'm ready again.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I want to have sex with a girl<br/>so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
You gotta help me!
I gotta get these damn things off!
I just love your overalls.
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.
You should be working somewhere<br/>that's making the world a better place,
or at least trying to.
No pressure, dude.<br/>I mean, sir.
Also,
if time travel is possible,
maybe you could give me<br/>a little sign
on Tuesday, December 8, at...
8:29 p.m.
So, someone sent back<br/>these chicken wings,
because they were too hot.<br/>And I'm like,
"Too hot? Are you crazy?"
So, free wings.
Old Man Marshall, as long as<br/>you're still married to Lily,
you're doing just fine.
Sir, this is on us.<br/>Sorry the wings were so hot.
It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, back in 2009,<br/>your Aunt Robin
was the host of a morning show<br/>for local New York cable.
And it was on pretty early. How early?
(LOUD SNORING)
ROBIN: Mike? Wake up.
(GRUNTING)
OLDER TED: But then, everything changed.
Coming up next...
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- See my show?<br/>- Aw, I meant to watch it.
I just got so busy<br/>with the whole being-sound-asleep thing.
It took all night,<br/>eight hours down the drain.
It's fine. But get this. After the broadcast...
- Hi. Are you Robin?<br/>- Yeah.
I'm Don, your new co-host.
OLDER TED: Don was Don Frank,<br/>a seasoned veteran of no fewer
than 38 local morning news teams<br/>from all over the country.
The guy was an industry legend.
Oh!
Wow! You are so going to hit that.
No! I just think we're going to be<br/>great together on the air.
And on the sofa and on the bed<br/>and on the coffee table.
All right, all right.
I'm gonna go up on the roof<br/>and stand there by myself for five minutes.
Have fun.
OLDER TED: And that's exactly<br/>what she did.
She just stood there.
All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you.
That's not what she did.<br/>Here's what she did.
All right, all right.
(GRUNTING) I'm going to<br/>go have a cigarette.
- What?<br/>- What?
OLDER TED: I promised her<br/>I'd never tell you this,
but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin<br/>did enjoy the occasional cigarette,
and occasionally that occasional cigarette
was more than just occasional.
I just left something<br/>like this in my apartment.
Robin, come on, take it to the roof.
We said no smoking in the apartment
after you torched the throw rug<br/>doing push-ups.
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, Robin. I mean, God,<br/>not only is that a filthy habit,
- but also, can I bum one?<br/>- Sure.
- What?<br/>- What?
OLDER TED: Kids, your Uncle Marshall<br/>definitely doesn't want you to know this,
but he also smoked off and on.
It all started when he was 13,<br/>on a camping trip in Minnesota.
Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate.<br/>It's summer vacation.
Okay, but just one.
This is my first and last cigarette ever.
OLDER TED: And that was the first of many,<br/>many last cigarettes ever.
That's it. I am done, I am out.
Last... Cigarette... Ev-arr!
OLDER TED: So, by that point,<br/>I'd heard it all before.
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?<br/>You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?<br/>It's gone, dude. Let it go.
I'm worried about work, okay?
They just hired a new head<br/>of the legal department,
and he's going to be letting people go.
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal department<br/>is Arthur Hobbs.
As in Artillery Arthur?<br/>As in your former boss?
OLDER TED: Arthur Hobbs<br/>was the meanest boss
Marshall or anyone else had ever had.
The last time Marshall worked for him,<br/>it ended like this.
I quit!
Yikes. So, does he hold it against you?
Worse.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Marshall Eriksen.
Um, we had a fairly intense<br/>screaming match.
No.
Wherein I suggested<br/>that you take your head
and store it within yourself
in a fashion that, well, while space-saving<br/>might limit its exposure to sunshine.
Well, that describes 95% of my employees
and everyone in my family,<br/>except for my dog.
He's such a good boy.
Well, I'll see you later, Randall Wilkerson.
- Marshall Eriksen.<br/>- Gary Dinkersfield, right.
- Great, he doesn't remember you.<br/>- Not great.
Arthur Hobbs hating Marshall,<br/>that's no big deal.
He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know<br/>that he cuts loose.
- He just fired What's-His-Face.<br/>- He fired What's-His-Face, Ted,
and What's-His-Face was invaluable.
Look, I can understand you getting upset,<br/>but it's not worth killing yourself over.
Yeah, wait till you get laid off,<br/>then kill yourself.
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now<br/>it's more like Where's-His-Face.
Look, it was just two cigarettes, okay?<br/>I can handle two.
As long as I don't have three<br/>within 24 hours,
then I'm not going to get hooked again.
What's Lily going to say<br/>when she finds out you smoked?
Lily's not going to find out.<br/>I have a system.
OLDER TED: Ah, yes, Marshall's system.
- Hey, Lil.<br/>- You smoked.
Damn it!
OLDER TED: The next morning,<br/>your Aunt Robin was thrilled
to be finally going on the air<br/>with a real pro.
In three, two, one...
- Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.<br/>- And I am Don Frank.
Two teens were arrested late last night<br/>for stealing a police cart.
No, I'm sorry, not a police cart,<br/>a police car.
(LAUGHING) Screw it. Brain fart.
Don't you hate those?
Look at that,<br/>the teleprompter's still running.
Something about a woman<br/>giving birth on an uptown bus.
Well, no point in jumping in halfway.<br/>I'll just wait till it's done.
(ROBIN GIGGLING NERVOUSLY)
And she cut the cord with a Metro Pass.
We'll be right back.
And we're clear.
What the hell was that?<br/>Don, you said "brain fart."
Look, Robin, you seem like a nice kid,<br/>but this is my 39th local news show, okay?
And in that time, I've learned three things:
Avoid the all-you-can-eat<br/>sushi buffet in Bismarck,
do not go to the bathroom<br/>with your lapel mic still on,
and three, at this hour,<br/>your entire viewing audience
is one half-drunk slob<br/>sitting in his underwear, so...
MIKE: Back in five, four...
Well, let's do a great show<br/>for that half-drunk slob.
Well, that half-drunk slob appreciates it.
OLDER TED: The next day, Marshall found<br/>himself craving a cigarette.
It was driving him crazy,<br/>so he decided to get some fresh air.
Oh, no.<br/>You're not up here to jump, are you?
No, no, no, no.
I fired a lot of people today.<br/>I don't need another jumper in my file.
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, uh, cigarette?
- No. No, thank you.<br/>- That's too bad.
You know what I miss, Jeffrey?<br/>Getting to know somebody over a smoke.
People are so interchangeable now,
but you share a butt with somebody,<br/>you got a real bond.
- You know what? I will take one.<br/>- Okay.
Thank you.
I'm Marshall, by the way.<br/>It's Marshall, Marshall Eriksen. Yeah.
Tell me something, Marshall Eriksen.
How would you like to see<br/>a picture of the cutest dog in the world?
There he is. He's a good boy.
- Hey.<br/>- You smoked.
Yes, I smoked,<br/>and it was my third of the day.
You know what that means?<br/>I'm a smoker now. It's all over.
I even bought a pack on the way home<br/>and a lighter and a Vikings lamp,
which has nothing to do with anything,
but I saw it in the window and I liked it.
Damn it, Marshall.
We already have four Vikings lamps<br/>and smoking kills.
It was a way to bond with my boss, okay?<br/>You should have seen me up there.
- That is a cute dog.<br/>- Yeah.
- Are those your kids?<br/>- Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Hey, look what I got at the mall.
(CHUCKLING)
There he is. There he is.<br/>Go ahead, you can pet him now.
- No.<br/>- Yeah, yeah, come on, he likes it.
Scratch him under the chin.
(BARKS)
(LAUGHING)
I don't care what your reasons are.<br/>You know how I feel about smoking.
Now, give me the cigarettes.
And the lighter.
Ah! That's the stuff.
- What?<br/>- What?
OLDER TED: Oh, yeah,<br/>add your Aunt Lily to the list.
Whenever Uncle Marshall<br/>fell off the wagon,
your Aunt Lily got dragged<br/>right down with him.
What you doing?
(SIGHING) If you must know,<br/>I am reaching out to City Hall
to try to get the mayor on our show.
Oh, my goodness, you are adorable,
but the mayor's not coming on<br/>a show nobody watches.
My colonoscopy had more viewers<br/>than this show.
At least that had some twists and turns.
Okay, you know,<br/>I don't know why you're acting like this.
I mean, maybe you're just bitter
because you never had a shot<br/>at a network job,
but I think I still do,<br/>so I really need to focus.
I've been on a network.
You were on a network?
It was the best Labor Day weekend<br/>of my life.
When you do the news,<br/>you're in these ergonomic chairs.
It feels like you're sitting on a cloud.
Which was nice<br/>'cause it was right after my colonoscopy.
- And the dressing rooms... Oh.<br/>- There's dressing rooms?
You bet your sweet headset<br/>there's dressing rooms, Mike.
No changing in the KFC bathroom<br/>across the street. No, sir.
It was heaven.
But the second you get used to it,
they go find someone<br/>who isn't "going through a bitter divorce"
and doesn't "reek of gin,"
and before you know it,<br/>you're stuck in a dead-end gig,
surrounded by people going nowhere,<br/>doing the news in your tighty whities.
Okay, the underwear thing<br/>was your choice,
and I don't like that it's catching on.
Ah! Looking good, fellows.<br/>Feels good, right?
God, I want to kill him.<br/>Of course people watch the show.
You guys watch the show,<br/>that's, like, two right there.
Oh, my God.<br/>You guys still haven't seen my show.
- What? We never miss it.<br/>- We've seen it!
Really? What color is the set?
(BOTH STUTTERING)
- It's black.<br/>- Right. Yeah.
- With, like, silver around the edges.<br/>- Uh-huh. Yeah.
Not your TV set, my show set.
BOTH: Oh!
God, if I can't even get my best friends<br/>to watch, who's going to watch?
Lots of people.<br/>You got bedridden insomniacs.
Bums camping outside a department store.
People waiting in the ER,<br/>where the TV is in a cage,
so you can't change the channel.
Do you have any stalkers?
Yeah, but even Leonard<br/>won't watch my show.
I can't believe those guys<br/>are smoking out there.
It's freezing out.
Remember when you used to be able<br/>to smoke in bars?
TED: Hey, dude. I think that hot girl<br/>over there's smiling at me.
BARNEY: That's a chair.<br/>But yeah, dude, hit that.
MARSHALL: Guys?
Marco!
TED: Polo!<br/>BARNEY: Polo!
Well, it's dividing our group<br/>into smokers and non-smokers.
- And that's not healthy.<br/>- You're right.
Let's go have a smoke.
- What?<br/>- What?
OLDER TED: Yeah, I'm not proud of it.
ROBIN: Look at you two. Smokers.<br/>Just like the rest of us.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>whoa, whoa, whoa.
I am not a smoker.<br/>I only smoke in certain situations:
Post-coital, when I'm with Germans...<br/>Sometimes those two overlap.
...coital, birthdays, to annoy my mom,
pre-coital, on a sailboat,
the day the Mets<br/>are mathematically eliminated every year,
and, of course, wait for it,<br/>'cause Lord knows I have,
pregnancy scares.
- Why are you smoking right now?<br/>- I'm always pre-coital, Ted.
You know, maybe smoking's not so bad.
I mean, at least it gets us out<br/>in the fresh air.
Yeah, and all the coughing<br/>really works my abs.
I... (COUGHS) Am... (COUGHS) Ripped!
(COUGHING VIOLENTLY)
OLDER TED: But as glamorous as it was,
within a week<br/>we all hit our breaking point.
(COUGHING)
You okay, sweetie?
(IN RASPY VOICE)<br/>Actually, baby, my throat's a bit sore.
(PANTING)
(SCREAMING)
So, I'm whapping him across the nose<br/>with the newspaper, right?
And my wife says,
"Come on,<br/>you can't treat your son like that."
I don't know.
(EX CLAIMS)
(GRUNTING)
Michael, call 911.
Oh, my God. Okay, yes, yeah, right away.
It's Marshall, by the way.
(ARTHUR SHOUTS)
Oh, my God. I hope Arthur's okay.<br/>Dibs on his office if he's not.
We have to quit smoking.
(IN RASPY VOICE) Honey,<br/>you said a mouthful.
I wish I had never started.
I mean, I think back to myself<br/>at 13 years old.
If I could only go back to that moment...
- I hate that little bastard.<br/>- (IN RASPY VOICE) Me, too.
- Okay, that's it. Let's quit.<br/>- Let's. Let's do it.
Well, I am proud of you guys.
I have heard how difficult it is for smokers,<br/>like yourself, to quit,
so, on behalf of non-smokers, I salute you,<br/>and I am here to help.
So, hand in your cigarettes,<br/>and I will get rid of them, one at a time.
(IN RASPY VOICE) You're quitting, dollface.
I know I don't normally call you "dollface,"<br/>but it kind of works in this voice.
Dollface.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey.
I was just wondering,
is anyone else interviewing the mayor<br/>tomorrow on TV, or is it just me?
- Hey, that's great.<br/>- Hey.
Yeah, Don can suck it, while I suck this.<br/>Light me, Marshall.
Actually, we've decided<br/>that we're all quitting smoking.
That's fantastic.
I'm sick of you guys<br/>bumming my cigarettes.
No, come on, Robin.<br/>We can't do it unless we all do it together.
No.
- You can sleep with Marshall.<br/>- Oh, God, Lily, no.
Sorry, baby,<br/>you got to take one for the team.
I don't want to sleep with Marshall.
- I've seen the looks.<br/>- Right.
I can't quit right now.<br/>Not before the biggest interview of my life.
- It's too stressful.<br/>- It's too stressful!
- Just have one more.<br/>- Give me a cigarette!
No, wait! Robin, Robin,<br/>think about this for a second.
Bloomberg is the anti-smoking mayor.
Do you really want to show up<br/>to that interview smelling like smoke?
Lt'd be like interviewing a vegetarian<br/>smelling like a McRib.
Really? Like I'm not going<br/>through enough right now?
Look, you're quitting. We're all quitting.
- Fine. I'll quit.<br/>- Great. Great.
We just have to get through<br/>the first 24 hours.
After that, it's a cakewalk.
(IN RASPY VOICE) Barney, do you have<br/>to bite your nails so loud?
I'm not biting my nails.
I'm trying to suck the leftover nicotine<br/>out of my fingertips.
Marshall, can you pass the onion rings?
What, you got dinosaur arms?<br/>They're right here.
What do you think cigarettes<br/>are doing right now?
You think they're thinking about us?
Dude, if you don't stop tapping your foot,<br/>it's coming off.
Oh, my God, Ted, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I should move it a little bit closer<br/>to your ass!
- I am ready to do this right now!<br/>- Ted, I...
OLDER TED: None of us knew<br/>what we were fighting about.
We just knew we wanted to smoke,<br/>more than anything in the world.
(MARSHALL GRUNTING)
OLDER TED: It wasn't going very well<br/>for Robin, either.
Sorry I'm late.
Someone used the microwave,<br/>and the elevator stopped.
- What are you doing?<br/>- Okay, Don. Don, seriously, not tonight.
Okay, I'm a little bit on edge<br/>because I quit smoking
for my interview with the mayor, so just...
Oh! Oh, you precious<br/>little porcelain unicorn, you.
- (CHUCKLES) Why would you do that?<br/>- Why?
Because I care, Don.
I care about the show,<br/>I care about my career.
Unlike you, you unprofessional jerk!<br/>You're sloppy, you're rude,
and I wish you worked half as hard
as the elastic on<br/>those stretched-out underpants.
(ROBIN SIGHS)
I'm starting to feel<br/>like this is getting a little personal.
No, Don, it would be getting personal<br/>if I would say
that the reason you bounce<br/>from market to market
is because you're a loser.<br/>A lazy, obnoxious loser.
The mayor canceled.
In five, four, three, two...
Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
You think I'm a loser?<br/>You're right. I'm a loser.
But at least I've accepted it.
A plucky raccoon<br/>has been cheering up patients
at a local senior center.
I used to be just like that.<br/>Always wanting more and never getting it.
It's a dead end, Robin.
You're never going to be a network anchor.
Just like you're never<br/>going to quit smoking.
What are you doing?
I'm enjoying a cigarette.
Oh! That'll get you there.
That's good.
- You want a drag?<br/>- Can we be professionals?
- Please?<br/>- (LAUGHING) Yeah. Professionals?
You know who's working<br/>the camera right now?
A chair.
We're on a show where we can't even<br/>get the cameraman to watch.
That's why the mayor canceled, Robin.
And that's why Mike<br/>is on a fried chicken run.
And that's why you and I<br/>can enjoy a cigarette
right here on the air.
- No, thank you.<br/>- Why?
Because of our millions and millions<br/>of impressionable viewers?
Okay. If any impressionable viewers<br/>have a problem with this,
please give us a call.<br/>The number's on the screen.
Chirp, chirp? Chirp, chirp?
Come on, Robin, live a little.
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh, that must be Mike.<br/>He always forgets, extra crispy. Hello?
- Robin, don't smoke that cigarette!<br/>- Marshall?
We're all watching<br/>and we're all very impressionable.
And I swear to God, if you smoke<br/>that cigarette, we're all going to smoke.
You guys are watching?
LILY: (IN RASPY VOICE) We sure are,<br/>sweetheart, and you look fabulous.
Oh, you guys.
You don't have to do this, Robin.<br/>You don't have to smoke.
Resist it, honey.
Thanks for the call, guys.
(ROBIN GASPS)
(ALL CHEERING)
- She did it!<br/>- Good for her.
We're not going to smoke.
I have a pack stashed up on the roof.
(BARNEY EX CLAIMING)
I'm awake. And I'm smoking!
Robin, you know how dangerous it is<br/>to wake a sleep-smoker? Dear God.
It's fine. I bought a pack on my way home.
- Hey, great show, Robin.<br/>- Yeah.
Yeah, but that Don guy, what a tool.
Well, no, he actually apologized to me.
No, I mean when he stood up.<br/>Those briefs were pretty revealing.
- You should date that guy.<br/>- (LAUGHS) Yeah. Not in this lifetime.
OLDER TED: They were dating within<br/>three months, but more on that later.
Hey, guys, look, the sun's coming up.
You know what right now<br/>is a perfect time for?
A last cigarette ever.
No, I mean, a real last cigarette ever.
Damn it, let's do it.
Okay.
All right.<br/>Last cigarette ever on the count of three.
- One...<br/>...two...
...three.
OLDER TED: We all quit<br/>for a while after that,
but it wasn't anyone's last cigarette.
We did eventually all quit smoking for real.
Robin's last cigarette was in June, 2013.
Barney's last cigarette was in March, 2017.
Lily's last cigarette was the day<br/>she started trying to get pregnant.
And Marshall's last cigarette<br/>was the day his son was born.
And my last cigarette?<br/>Two weeks into dating your mother.
And I never looked back.
(MARSHALL EXHALES)
I'm sorry I hit you, buddy.
I wanted to make it up to you<br/>by giving you this.
Wow, she's hot!
Yeah. Well, some day,<br/>you're going to marry her.
No way.
- We're pretty lucky.<br/>- Totally.
I'll be in my tent.
Oh, no. Wait, hey! No, don't do that.
Well...
Have fun for me.

I recognize you.
Do you remember<br/>the first day of classes last semester?
Econ 305?

I thought I was in Architecture 101,<br/>but it was Econ 305.
Of course, what I didn't know was
that your mother was<br/>somewhere in that class,

I thought you were a complete idiot.

She's a PhD candidate.<br/>She reads philosophy for fun.
She does the Sunday crossword<br/>every week and finishes it.
- Ooh.<br/>- BARNEY: Wow.
Ted, I am so happy for you.
Sorry, not for you, happy I'm not you.
Long story short, I have a date tonight.
Oh, yay.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Thanks, New York,<br/>I'll try not to screw it up.
What's going on?<br/>There's a huge line outside MacLaren's.
And why is it almost entirely dudes?
Only two things<br/>could cause that kind of commotion.
Boobs.
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>MacLaren's has hired a hot bartender.
(MAN SINGING) Sweet cherry pie, yeah
Look at all these guys.
Oh, the sidewalk's going to smell<br/>like pee-pee now.
Well, we'd better start looking<br/>for a new bar.
What, are you... What... Are you crazy?<br/>It is a hot bartender.
Do you know how long<br/>I have been waiting to land a...
My friends, I have been with many women<br/>in my day.
Lawyers, teachers, poets, doctors,
professional equestrians,<br/>amateur equestrians,
a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker...
Yes, we're to the rhyming section now.
A math professor, a tax assessor,<br/>a weight guesser.
A puppeteer, a blackjack dealer,
a stay-at-home mom...<br/>That's a job, too, guys.
A circuit court judge...
Get to the point!
I have never, ever scored a hot bartender.
Until tonight.
She's really not that hot.
Oh, is someone jealous of all the attention?
Did somebody fancy herself<br/>the hottest girl in the bar?
Gosh, no. Shut up!
- All right, wish me luck.<br/>- It's never going to happen.
Barney, she's just going<br/>to pretend to like you
the same way she hypnotized<br/>all these geniuses.
Yeah, but guess who's not going to<br/>fall under her spell?
I'm gonna be all, " Drop the act, baby doll.<br/>Daddy needs a gin and tonic."
Then when she brings it,<br/>I'll just spit it out and say, "Try again."
Boom! Alpha dog is right<br/>where he belongs, on top.
Then after a few minutes, on the bottom.<br/>Why should I do all the work?
- Hi, Marshall.<br/>- Hey, guys, what's happening?
- New super-hot bartender.<br/>- Oh, yeah?
- Eh.<br/>- Ha!
See? Marshall doesn't think<br/>she's hot either.
Yes, he does.
Baby, you don't have to pretend<br/>other women aren't attractive
just for my sake.
(SCOFFS) I know, and if that woman<br/>were anywhere near as hot
as the woman I'm married to,<br/>then I'd admit it. But she's not.
(GIGGLES) Baby, you're so sweet,<br/>but compared to that woman,
I am a big bag of three-day-old garbage.
Well, I call 'em like I see 'em,
and I just think you're the most<br/>beautiful woman in the world.
See, that's just annoying.
- Oh, my God, you are so funny.<br/>- (MUMBLES)
- That'll be $6.75.<br/>- Here's a 50, keep the change.
Thank you.
Amateurs. Hey.
- What do you want?<br/>- Drop the act, baby doll...
Wait, what?
Are you gonna order a drink
or are you just gonna stand there<br/>looking stupid?
- Um...<br/>- I don't know how to make an "um."
Is that equal parts vodka<br/>and get-the-hell-out-of-my-face?
Hey, Bobby!
OLDER TED: Later that night, I embarked<br/>upon a very important first date.
- How are you?<br/>- Good. Come in.
OLDER TED: It's funny.
Sometimes you walk into a place<br/>you've never been before...
- Just one sec.<br/>- Sure.
OLDER TED: But you get the feeling
you're exactly where<br/>you're supposed to be.
And, kids, that's the first time I ever saw<br/>your mother's little yellow bus.
You know the one.
It's right behind you.
Hey, this is cute.
Actually, it's my roommate's.
OLDER TED: So, there I was, kids,<br/>standing in your mother's apartment.
Never mind the fact that<br/>I was on a date with her roommate, Cindy.
Sorry, I shouldn't be messing<br/>with your roommate's stuff.
(CHUCKLES)
What's she like?
OLDER TED: I didn't know it,<br/>but I was about to hear
the very first description<br/>of the woman I'd one day marry.
She's a whore.
- I think she's a dominatrix.<br/>- What?
Okay, I'm sorry, none of that is true.
I have a bit of a roommate complex.
Why?
Guys are always falling in love with her.
Hey, hey, look at me.
I promise you
I am not going to fall in love<br/>with your roommate.
OLDER TED: Oops.
Okay, now that you've had a closer look,<br/>admit it.
That bartender is the hottest woman<br/>in this bar.
(COUGHS) Second hottest.
I repeat...
Eh.
(SCOFFS) Baby, how could you<br/>not want to hit that? I want to hit that.
If you don't want to hit that,<br/>I'm sorry, but you might be gay.
Hell, yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.
Whatever. Did you find out why
I'm the one guy in this entire bar<br/>she seems to despise?
I did, um,
you're not going to like the answer.
My last three boyfriends<br/>were Wall Street guys. Bastards.
So, I vowed never again to date<br/>a guy who wears suits.
Huh!
Okay, well, that's easy.<br/>All I have to do is stop wearing suits.
Oh, that's all, Barney?<br/>Come on, you're never not in a suit.
True. But for those... I mean, for that...
I mean, for her,
I will stop wearing...
- Wait for it.<br/>- We know you're going to say "suits."
...suits.
(MARSHALL AND LILY GASP)
OLDER TED: Meanwhile, Cindy and I<br/>were having a lovely evening,
except she wasn't kidding<br/>about her roommate complex.
And another weird thing<br/>about my roommate,
she does these bizarre paintings<br/>of robots playing sports.
Yeah, that is weird.
OLDER TED: I was lying.<br/>That sounded awesome.
Your mother's robot volleyball watercolor<br/>is hanging up in the den as we speak.
Yeah. And she has this crazy habit<br/>of making breakfast food sing show tunes.
That's just bizarre.
OLDER TED: Your mother's rendition<br/>ofMemories
as performed by an English muffin is,<br/>to this day,
the most hauntingly beautiful thing<br/>I've ever heard.
(CIND Y SCOFFS)
Look, I'm sold. I hate this girl.
I'm sorry.
Look, she's not that bad.<br/>I just get a little jealous.
I don't know why. You're awesome.
OLDER TED: But not as awesome<br/>as your mother.
And speaking of things<br/>that are less awesome,
your Uncle Barney<br/>had officially suited down.
I am so sorry I misjudged you.
If there is one type of person<br/>that I cannot stand,
- it is a man in a suit.<br/>- Ugh.
That, and a woman<br/>who has no respect for herself.
- Ugh.<br/>- Yeah.
Suits and insecure women. I hate them.
Just hate them.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, how was your date with Cindy?
Well, last night was great,<br/>today not so much.
What, why?
I found out the school's policy
about students and professors dating<br/>is really strict.
I could lose my scholarship.
Yeah, but it's not like you're in my class.
I mean, we're not even<br/>in the same department.
I'm sorry, but I just can't risk it.
- She's completely overreacting, right?<br/>- Actually, Ted, she has a point.
Yeah, and think about it.<br/>If the rules are that strict,
you could be putting your job in jeopardy.
I think you got to let this one go, buddy.
Let's try this again.<br/>She's completely overreacting, right?
OLDER TED: Of course, they were right.<br/>I had to let it go.
But as your Uncle Barney<br/>was about to find out,
it's not so easy to let things go.
(VOICES WHISPERING)
MALE VOICE: Suit up.
OLDER TED: Now, none of us had ever seen<br/>Barney go this long without suiting up,
and, kids, it wasn't pretty.
So sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.
Yeah, today I had that presentation
on offshore dividend tax implications.
Sure, I was totally paying attention<br/>when you talked about that.
Right, so I fire up the PowerPoint...
Um, Barney?
- Barney.<br/>- Huh.
(PANTING)
MALE VOICE: Suit up.
Hey, Barney,<br/>we're going to order some food.
- BARNEY: Okay, be out in a sec.<br/>- Okay.
Okay.
(CLOTH RIPPING)
No.
Out of the way! Stay with me.<br/>It's not your time.
OLDER TED: If anyone could fix something<br/>like this,
it was Barney's personal tailor,<br/>TV's Tim Gunn.
I'm sorry, Barney. I couldn't make it work.
(WHIMPERING)
So young.
(WHIMPERING) There's nothing else<br/>you could do?
No. But there is another suit<br/>that can use the buttons from your suit.
That can... Like an organ donor?
Your suit's death<br/>could mean another suit's life.
Oh, my God.
Do it.
You're doing the right thing.
(CRYING)
Please don't cry on this.
- It's silk.<br/>- (CRYING) I'm sorry.
I know. I know.
(CRYING)
We cremated the remains.
His buttons saved the life
of a sick little jacket<br/>on the Upper East Side.
Well, at least now you<br/>can finally drop this quest
for the so-called hot bartender.
No.
My suit gave its life for this cause,
and I will not rest until those...
I mean, that... I mean, she is mine.
He's absolutely right.
Who, the guy kissing a jar<br/>full of dead suit ashes? That guy?
What if Cindy is the woman<br/>I'm supposed to marry,
and I'm just giving up?
So long, elegant yet welcoming<br/>home in Westchester
with a sensible mortgage I can handle<br/>without dipping into my savings.
Bye-bye, two kids I raised with<br/>a stern yet loving hand,
finding the perfect balance<br/>between father and friend.
Adi?s, triplet schnauzers,<br/>Frank, Lloyd, and Wright.
- Ted!<br/>- Ted!
The point is, I'm not giving up, either!
I don't know why I just did that.
Barney, I'm so sorry about your friend.
- Tell me about him.<br/>- Huh.
He was Italian.
Classy, elegant.
And boy, did he have a way<br/>with the ladies.
They just couldn't say no.
- How old was he?<br/>- Seven.
(CRYING) I miss him so much!
You shouldn't be alone tonight.
I'm gonna end my shift early.
Thank you, old friend.
You're going out with a bang.
Come on, Marshall.<br/>Just admit that she's hotter than me.
- I won't be hurt.<br/>- Can't do it.
- You're hotter.<br/>- She's a goddess!
Her skin glows. Her legs go for miles.
And that ass?<br/>I would wear that thing for a hat.
Last night in bed, I'll admit it,
she popped into my head<br/>a couple of times.
Whoa. What are you trip...
Like, you think she's hotter than me?
I never said that.
Oh, my God! You do.
Well, it's apples and oranges.<br/>She's younger than you.
Well, I'm just saying, like,<br/>me in my prime versus her in her prime.
- Well...<br/>- Oh, my God!
You guys, her hotness isn't even real!
It's circumstantial hotness.
Watch.
(MAN SINGING) She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water<br/>Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry<br/>Sweet cherry pie
I suppose you think<br/>she's hotter than me, too.
- What the hell are you doing?<br/>- What?
- You're not allowed back here.<br/>- Oh, no. Uh, I... Carl, look.
(STUTTERING) No. I don't want to go back.
Please, please,<br/>just don't make me go back.
- You got to go.<br/>- Don't. I...
- You got to go.<br/>- I just... No, Carl. I was...
I was somebody back there!
Everybody loved me.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Hey.<br/>- Hi.
Can we talk?
My roommate's<br/>just about to get out of the shower.
- Let's talk in my room.<br/>- Okay.
(SIGHS) Look, Cindy, I know<br/>the university rulebook says we can't date.
But it also says, "Don't teach drunk,"<br/>and I do that all the time.
The point is, I like you.
I do. You're sweet, you're funny.
You're writing a dissertation entitled<br/>"Foreign Direct Investment
"and Intergenerational Linkages<br/>in Consumption Behavior."
I mean, that is hot.
I know this sounds crazy,
but I feel like our paths<br/>are supposed to cross somehow.
And I don't want to miss out<br/>on knowing you.
I don't want to miss out on<br/>knowing you, either.
Look, I got to tell you,
I mean, just from looking around<br/>your room,
I can tell we have a ton in common.
- Really?<br/>- The Unicorns?
Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?
I have never met anyone else<br/>who has this album.
That's my roommate's. I borrowed it.
Oh.
Well, well, what about this?<br/>World's End by T.C. Boyle?
That was a birthday gift<br/>from my roommate.
Haven't checked it out yet.
Oh.
Oh, you should. It's a good read.
What about this? This is ridiculous.
You play bass? Seriously, ask my friends.
I always say, " My ideal woman
"does not play bass,"<br/>because this is clearly your roommate's.
- She's in a band.<br/>- Damn, that's cool.
This is unbelievable.
You just picked out the only three things<br/>in here that are my roommate's.
So, does your roommate's band<br/>ever play shows, or...
Get out.
OLDER TED: Kids, as you probably guessed,<br/>that wasn't the night I met your mother.
Although I think I glimpsed her foot.
But I did get a little bit closer<br/>to meeting the woman of my dreams.
And your mom?<br/>Well, she got her yellow umbrella back.
He was just so special, you know?
I feel like we should give him<br/>a moment of silence.
Followed by, like, 20 minutes of grunting.
I'm gonna make you feel all better.
Hmm.
- Let me just go freshen up.<br/>- All right.
Oh, wait. No, no, that's not the bathroom!
That...
Are these yours?
I'm suit-sitting for someone.
Barney, you lied to me.
(SIGHS)
You have to choose right now.
Me or the suits.
(SINGING) I know what you're thinking<br/>What's Barney been drinking?
That girl was smoking hot
Yes, I could've nailed her<br/>But no, it's not a failure
'Cause there's one thing she is not
To score a ten would be just fine<br/>But I'd rather be dressed to the nines
It's a truth you can't refute
Nothing suits me like a suit!
Picture a world<br/>Where all the boys and girls
Are impeccably well-dressed
That delivery guy in a jacket and tie
That puppy in a double-breast
That '80s dude with muttonchops<br/>That baby with a lollipop
That lady cop who's kind of cute
Nothing suits them like a suit
- Suits<br/>- A wingman I can wear
- Suits<br/>- They're oh, so debonair
- Suits<br/>- The perfect way to snare
A girl with daddy issues
- Suits<br/>- In navy blue or black
Check out this perfect rack
I want to give them a squeeze
Oh, really?
Then answer these questions if you please
What would you do if you had to choose<br/>Between your suits and a pot of gold?
Suits
What would you say<br/>if you gave your suits away
And in return you'd never grow old?
Suits
What would you pick?<br/>One million chicks
Or a single three-piece suit?
It's moot
What if world peace<br/>Were within your reach?
(STUTTERING) I'm gonna stop you<br/>right there.
It's suits. Come on, Lily,<br/>get your head out of your ass.
Two, three, four
Girls will go and girls will come<br/>But there's only one absolute
Every bro on the go needs to know<br/>That there's no accepted substitute
I'm sorry, suits, let's make amends<br/>My Sunday best are my best friends
Send casual Friday down the laundry chute
'Cause nothing suits the undisputed
Oft-saluted suitor of repute
Like
A
Wait for it.
Suit
Nothing suits him
Like a suit
Suit Up! Suit Up!
Suit Up! Suit Up!
Then again, she is pretty hot.
I choose you, baby.
First thing tomorrow,<br/>I'm getting rid of these suits.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
BARNEY: Mmm.
(WHISPERING) You guys are fine.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, when you're<br/>in your 30s and live in New York,
there's a few places<br/>you just never want to be.
Times Square on New Year's Eve.<br/>Rockefeller Center around Christmastime.
- Yeah.<br/>- But most of all...
A college bar? Man, we're probably<br/>gonna run into my students.
They're gonna corner me<br/>and want a free lecture.
I don't even have my slide projector.
Ted, I've been skee ball champ here<br/>since law school.
I have to pop in at least once a month<br/>to maintain my record.
Whoa, looks like you've been gone awhile.
Some guy named Big Fudge<br/>has been cleaning up.
Yeah, he has.
- And you're Big Fudge.<br/>- The biggest.
So, by the way,<br/>I have to tell you something.
- Yep.<br/>- I invited Jenkins.
Jenkins? No way.
We'd all started hearing about Jenkins<br/>a few weeks earlier.
You guys will not believe<br/>what Jenkins did this time.
Who's Jenkins?
He's this hilarious new lawyer<br/>at Marshall's office.
Hilarious!
Okay, so, there's this jar of maraschino<br/>cherries in the fridge at work,
so Jenkins says,<br/>"200 bucks, I'll eat the whole jar."
So we give Jenkins 200 bucks,
and Jenkins ate the whole jar!
(LAUGHING)
(PEOPLE EX CLAIMING)
Jenkins.
OLDER TED:<br/>And after that, the stories kept coming.
So the CFO comes in<br/>to sign some acquisition papers.
So Jenkins goes, "Excuse me, Mr. Wilcox.<br/>I think we forgot one of the documents. "
Jenkins!
So we all go out for beers after work.
Jenkins gets up on the table
and starts gyrating<br/>like some sort of deranged stripper.
Next thing you know, off comes the shirt.<br/>It was so gross.
- Jenkins.<br/>- Jenkins.
Right?
Well, it'll be great<br/>to finally meet the famous Jenkins
- after all those stories.<br/>- Yeah.
And there's about to be one more story.<br/>I'm gonna bang Jenkins.
- What?<br/>- You heard me.
You want to have sex with Jenkins?
With Jenkins, on Jenkins, near Jenkins.<br/>You name it.
I want to wear Jenkins like a sock.
You... But you're... Haven't you all...<br/>I'm... Really?
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Ted, this is Jenkins.
Oh!
Look, this is gonna sound crazy,<br/>but I thought Jenkins was a guy.
What? That's crazy.<br/>What gave you that idea?
I don't know, maybe the whole Jenkins-<br/>peed-out-the-window-of-a-cab story.
- Yeah. Much more impressive now, isn't it?<br/>- Yeah!
Okay, I'll come clean!<br/>It all started a few weeks ago.
By the way, four eyes, new lawyer.<br/>This is Jenkins.
- Watch out for this guy. He steals stuff.<br/>- I don't steal stuff.
And I don't wear glasses.
- I'm Marshall.<br/>- Hi, Marshall.
So, are you really a Vikings fan,<br/>or was he lying about that, too?
Why? Is this a trap?<br/>Are you a Packers fan?
My wife knows I'm here.<br/>She doesn't have money,
but what she does have<br/>is a very special set of skills.
I'm a Vikings fan, too.<br/>I bleed purple and gold.
I'm from Pelican Rapids!
- Pelican Rapids? No way!<br/>- Yeah.
My grandpa lives in Pelican Rapids.
Well, I mean, he's dead now,<br/>but he haunts a barn off Route 108.
(LAUGHS)
TED: Whoa! Hold it. Hold it.
Dude, if you tell me you have a thing<br/>for a woman that is not your wife,
I will drag you outside and kick your ass.
Okay, first of all, come on, buddy.<br/>You can't handle the Fudge.
Second of all, no,<br/>I think of her like a big brother,
who, I guess, has boobs.
But so does my oldest brother,<br/>Marvin Jr. Anyway,
that night, I told Lily about...
- Jenkins.<br/>- I can't wait to meet him.
MARSHALL: I should have corrected her.<br/>It would have been so easy.
But I didn't. So, after that,<br/>whenever I talked about Jenkins,
I always avoided pronouns.
So the head of marketing comes in<br/>to choose people for the mid-west audit.
So he goes, him, him, her, him, him,
Jenkins, him, her...
I don't understand<br/>why you wouldn't just tell Lily.
Do you really think<br/>she'd be all that jealous?
Ted, think about those stories I told you.
(WHISTLING)
(ALL EX CLAIMING)
- Yeah, I could see how that'd be a problem.<br/>- Exactly. That's why Lily can't find out.
- Lily can't find out what?<br/>- That Marshall's gonna buy her a horse.
You are? That is so awesome!<br/>I love those things!
Guys, why is that kid over there<br/>staring at me?
I think I know what this is.<br/>I think it has finally happened.
- I'm getting recognized from my show.<br/>- Robin, that is so cute.
But that's Scotty. He's one of my students,<br/>and he's looking at me.
How weird is it<br/>that I'm more famous than you?
(CHUCKLES)<br/>Not at all, 'cause you're not. I'm on TV.
Yeah, and I have 30 students in my class.<br/>That's what, 30 times your viewership?
Now let's give Scotty a little thrill.<br/>Buying a drink for the old prof.
All right, Scotter, one question<br/>about neo-classical architecture
- and that is it.<br/>- You're Robin Scherbatsky, right?
- What?<br/>- Yes, I am.
Wow! Look, I didn't mean to stare.<br/>It's just... I watch your show all the time.
- Really?<br/>- Really?
Totally!
- What are you doing out with Ted?<br/>- It's Professor Mosby.
We're friends.
Holy crap! Robin Scherbatsky's friends<br/>with my econ professor!
It's architecture!
All right, you know what, Scotty,<br/>you're crowding us. Hit the bricks.
- Wait a minute. You're Big Fudge!<br/>- Go!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Hey, baby, I'm on my way up.
What? Why?
There was a measles outbreak at school<br/>and they called a half-day.
Thought I'd come by here, have lunch,<br/>maybe give you the measles?
Okay.
Um. I have a problem. That was my wife.
When I first mentioned you,<br/>she mistakenly thought you were a guy,
- and so...<br/>- So now you're worried
that once she finds out I'm a woman,<br/>she's gonna totally flip out.
- Yes, exactly.<br/>- Oh, jeez. Oh, gosh.
Okay, okay.<br/>I was in an improv group in Pelican Rapids.
- Follow my lead.<br/>- Okay.
- Lily!<br/>- Hey, baby...
Hi, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.
Hi, Lily. I'm from the French Embassy.
I'm here because of a small but significant<br/>cheese incident that occurred.
She's Jenkins!
You're Jenkins?
Yeah, well, that Camembert crisis<br/>isn't gonna resolve itself,
so I'll catch you guys on the flip-flop.
OLDER TED: Marshall cringed.<br/>This was the moment he had feared.
The famous Jenkins! How about that?
Funny, I was picturing a guy.<br/>Anyhoo, lunch?
(STAMMERING)<br/>Wait. So you're not jealous at all?
(LAUGHING) Sweetie, I never have<br/>to worry about you with another woman.
Right, well,<br/>'cause we're so hopelessly in love, right?
(LAUGHS) Yeah, sure. Anyhoo, lunch?
- She wasn't jealous at all!<br/>- Of course she wasn't jealous.
That's the whole dynamic<br/>of your relationship.
- What's that supposed to mean?<br/>- Well, it's like this, my man.
Every good relationship<br/>has a reacher and a settler.
Exactly. One person reaches for someone<br/>out of their league,
the other one settles<br/>for someone below theirs.
I did not settle for Lily.<br/>Okay, yes, she's a little short,
and true, my mom says she doesn't have<br/>the hips to birth an Eriksen child, but it...
Oh, my God,<br/>you guys think I'm the reacher.
That's why Lily's not jealous.
The settler is never jealous of the reacher<br/>because where's the reacher gonna go?
The settler, Lily, is the best thing that<br/>the reacher, Marshall, is ever gonna get.
No! Okay, yes, I'm lucky to have Lily,<br/>but Lily is just as lucky to have me!
Okay? Neither one of us is the reacher.
Dude, you are so the reacher.<br/>You're getting her a horse.
(LAUGHING)
- What?<br/>- Shh. Take the hit. Take the hit.
Thus ending modern architecture's<br/>very brief experiment
with the V-frame house.
Um. Excuse me for a second.<br/>What are you doing here?
(LOUDLY) I noticed you forgot something<br/>this morning, so I thought I'd bring it by.
- Your pen.<br/>- This is your pen.
And you chewed<br/>on the end of this recently.
Not a problem, Ted.
- Your class was on my way to work...<br/>- No, it's not.
...at Come On, Get Up, New York,
- where I'm an anchor, so...<br/>- I watch your show all the time.
What? You watch the show?
Oh! Well, paint me flattered!<br/>Any other fans out there?
- Oh! We got...<br/>- Okay, all right.
- Thanks for coming by, Robin.<br/>- Well, tune in tonight.
I'm doing a great piece on snail poison.
Also, who's got the worst pizza<br/>in New York?
I'll give you the answer after traffic<br/>on the ones, threes, fives, and nines.
Really? You guys watch her show?
It's like watching a well-lit aquarium,<br/>but not as interesting.
And now that I think about it,<br/>not as well lit.
Well, the truth is,<br/>we watch it for the drinking game.
The who now?
Her morning show comes on so early<br/>we're usually still at the bar,
so whenever she does an interview,
you have to drink<br/>every time she says "but, um."
- "But, um"?<br/>- "But, um."
Apparently, she says it a lot.
It's funny.<br/>I had a drinking game based on Robin,
but it was actually on Robin.
I'd pour Peach Schnapps<br/>in her bellybutton...
- Dude, we agreed we wouldn't do this.<br/>- Sorry. You're right.
She didn't like it anyway.<br/>Said it woke her up.
Does she really say "but, um" that much?
OLDER TED: That night,<br/>we found out just how much she said it.
That's great, but, um...
- "But, um."<br/>- Nice.
This wasn't your first spelling bee, was it?
- Nope. Third.<br/>- Oh! Good for you, but, um...
- But, um.<br/>- But, um.
But, um... But, um... But, um...<br/>But, um... But, um...
But, um... But, um... But, um...<br/>But, um... But, um... But, um...
(LAUGHING)
(SLURRING INDISTINCTLY)
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
Hmm.
Interesting article in the paper.
Says that in every relationship<br/>there's a reacher and a settler.
Really? Let me see it.
It's not in this newspaper.<br/>It's in one I read awhile back.
This newspaper reminded me<br/>of the other newspaper. Anyhoo...
- What do you think about that?<br/>- Well, I guess sometimes that's the case.
But not in ours.
- What? No, of course not.<br/>- Right.
Well, say, gun to your head,<br/>you had to say one of us was the reacher.
Well, I'd say it's neither.<br/>That's what makes us great.
Okay, now, there's a gun to my head,
and our future children,<br/>and our future cat or monkey,
depending on who wins the game of Risk<br/>we've been playing for three years.
Nope. No reacher, no settler.
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, how about this...
OLDER TED: This went on for a while.
Until finally...
Our two kids, our eight grandkids,<br/>our 11 great-grandkids
are all on a plane piloted by Oprah,
and it's about to crash into an art museum<br/>with all of your favorite paintings,
and the only way,<br/>the only way to save everything,
is just to answer the question.<br/>Are you the reacher or the settler?
- And Oprah's tried everything?<br/>- Everything! You have to decide now!
(SIGHING)
Well, I guess if I had to say,<br/>then maybe I'd say
- I'm the settler.<br/>- How could you say that?
She thinks that she's the settler.
I mean, that's it. I gotta prove to her<br/>that I am not the reacher.
I gotta make her jealous.
Well, that's easy. Here's the plan.<br/>Step one, sleep with Jenkins.
Step two, I sleep with Jenkins first.
Step three, we do step two first.<br/>I'm gonna go get started on step two.
Okay, okay, I got something.
Remember the other night,<br/>the skee ball game?
When you were putting nothing but wood<br/>in the 50-hole?
Whatever. Just another night<br/>for Big Fudge.
(KABOOM PLAYING)
Hello, baby, ooh!
Swish, sock, bonk, ping
Hello, baby, ooh!
Fad, flip, flop, wing
Ooh!
Swish, sock, bonk, ping
Hello, baby
- You thought she was into me?<br/>- Full-on lady wood.
Yes. Of course. A plan taketh shape.
If Lady Lily's jealousy<br/>young Marshall cannot budge,
then perchance, fair gentles,
Big Fudge can make her jealous.
Okay, let me try that again.
- Lf Lady Lily...<br/>- I got it, buddy. I got it.
Ted, I have got a great idea.
Is it clean your hair out of the shower drain<br/>when you're done?
Seriously, it's like you're trying<br/>to carpet the tub.
If you wanted to print out<br/>one of your lectures or something,
I could read it on air.<br/>Coming from a more entertaining source,
your students might actually pay attention<br/>and learn something.
Oh! You're entertaining?
Last night there was three minutes<br/>of dead air
while you sewed a button<br/>back on your sweater.
Look, just because your class<br/>likes me more than you...
- You're a drinking game!<br/>- What?
That's why they watch.<br/>They made a drinking game out of you.
Every time you say "but, um,"<br/>they do a shot.
- "But, um"?<br/>- Yeah.
I don't say "but, um."<br/>I have never said "but, um."
Well, then I guess<br/>it's not a very good drinking game,
which would mean last night,<br/>when Barney and I played it,
I didn't get super wasted<br/>and throw up all over myself.
(LAUGHING)<br/>Wait! I did both of those things, so face!
- Hey, Jenkins.<br/>- Hey, buddy.
Hey, so Lily and I are gonna go back<br/>to that college bar again,
and we were wondering<br/>if maybe you wanted to come.
You could just, like,<br/>watch me play skee ball,
or do exactly what you did the other night.<br/>Something like that.
It's really up to you. I mean, I know that...
(SCREAMING)
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)
Hey, baby, what are you doing home?
"Baby"? That's a name I don't deserve.
- What?<br/>- Jenkins kissed me.
She kissed me.
The other day she saw me play skee ball,<br/>and I don't know,
I guess she caught<br/>some of the Big Fudge fever.
But you have to know,<br/>I stopped it right away,
and you're the only one for me, baby.
Oh, I see what this is.
This is about<br/>the whole reacher-settler thing.
Come again for Big Fudge?
You want to make me jealous,<br/>so you're making up a story about Jenkins.
I'm not making this up! This happened!<br/>That woman kissed me, with tongue.
- Her tongue was in my mouth!<br/>- Sure it was.
It was thick and rough, like a starfish arm!
I'm so jealous!<br/>I'm just gonna go over there
and punch her right in the nose.<br/>Give her a knuckle sandwich!
Come on, baby. You want some soup?
It happened!
Do you have any split-pea left?
These are just a few of the many<br/>contributions he made to architecture,
and yet, he is only remembered<br/>for one thing.
That, my friends, is the sad legacy<br/>of Gregorio Francetti Gazebo.
Any questions?
Hey, do you want to go out<br/>drinking with us tonight?
- What?<br/>- Yeah, we were gonna play
the Robin Scherbatsky drinking game.
We were wondering<br/>if you wanted to join us.
Well, what can I say except, "But-ums up."
Can I still come?
I'll pay.
(ALL MURMUR IN AGREEMENT)
So, your third book<br/>was your breakout novel, but, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
Damn! Sorry.
But... Just "but," no "um." Just "but."
Your first novel was written more quickly.
- That's correct.<br/>- But, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
How great is this?
OLDER TED: And it was right then<br/>that Robin got an idea
that would end the drinking game forever.
I wanted to ask you about the novel<br/>you're writing right now, but, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
It's an idea you've had for a... But, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
... time. But, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
No. No, no, no. Don't drink. It's a trap.
I think I'm gonna go.<br/>You can keep your 10 bucks.
Okay, but, um, thanks for being with us.
But, um,<br/>if there's any college kids watching,
but-um, but-um, but-um, but-um,<br/>but-um, but-um, but-um, but-um...
We have to drink, professor. It's the rules.
She said "but, um."
God help us all.
There you are.<br/>I'm so sorry I kissed you yesterday.
- That's okay.<br/>- And I'm sorry I had sex with you
in the mailroom.
That wasn't me.
Good grief! That's two awkward<br/>conversations I have to have today.
I don't normally do that. I was really drunk.
- You were drunk at 8:00 in the morning?<br/>- Yeah, I don't know how that happened.
ROBIN: I thought snail pellets were safe,<br/>but, um...
- But, um!<br/>- But, um!
I gotta get to work.
Man, that game is really catching on.
- Damn it! How could I do this?<br/>- It's okay.
No, you know what? It's not okay.<br/>You're the nicest guy in this stupid office,
and I really don't want<br/>to screw up our friendship.
This is so embarrassing.<br/>Please don't tell anyone.
No, who am I gonna tell? Lily? I told Lily.
For Pete's sake. Well, I gotta go talk to her.<br/>I gotta apologize.
- No! No! No!<br/>- Yes.
Marshall, I'm just gonna tell her<br/>that it happened, that it meant nothing,
- and that I'm sorry.<br/>- No, I...
Yes. Yes. Do that.
- I will.<br/>- Yeah,
and if you don't have time for all that,
just tell her it happened<br/>and that you're sorry.
And if you're in a real rush,<br/>you don't even have to say "I'm sorry."
Just tell her that it happened.
That's the important part,<br/>that it actually happened.
So, emphasize that as much as you can.
And so, Lily,<br/>I guess what I'm saying is, it happened.
I feel terrible about it, and I'm really sorry.
Well, it happened.
What are you gonna do?<br/>It happened. Terrible.
But like I said, it happened.
Exactly. And I feel awful about it.
And I'd hate myself<br/>if what I did hurt you in any way,
or affected your relationship<br/>with Marshall.
- Please forgive me.<br/>- Kiss my husband? My husband?
Nobody kisses my future baby-daddy<br/>but me!
(LILY GRUNTING)
- Marshall, you're blocking the shot!<br/>- Well, I...
OLDER TED: And kids, your Uncle Marshall<br/>never tried to make Lily jealous again.
- Lil!<br/>- That's good.
Okay, we're just gonna have<br/>a nice low-key class today.
Not a lot of talking. No loud noises.
Sup, guys?
No, no, no, no, no. Please, just go away.
I just wanted to drop by and say...
(SIREN BLARING)
Thanks for watching,<br/>Come on, Get Up, New York!
Whoo!
But, um!

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, we all have<br/>different ways of dealing with nerves.
It'll just be a few more minutes,<br/>Mr. Stinson.
OLDER TED: Some people chew their nails.<br/>Some people tap their feet.
And some people imagine they're being<br/>interviewed by renowned sportscaster,
Jim Nantz.
Hello, friends. Every sport has had an icon<br/>who transcends the game.
Boxing had Ali, basketball had Jordan,
and the sport of sleeping<br/>with random hotties
has my next guest, Mr. Barney Stinson.
- Barney, welcome.<br/>- Thanks, Jim.
- Great to be back on the show.<br/>- Good to have you with us.
And, you know, the stats,<br/>they really speak for themselves.
Over 200 women, spanning six continents,<br/>17 nationalities, 74 sexual positions,
and not a single fatty. It's impressive.
And with all<br/>these accomplishments though,
there's one laurel<br/>that's always eluded you,
which brings us to last week.<br/>What was the story there?
Buckle up, Jimbo. This one's a doozy.
BARNEY: It all started when I decided<br/>to set myself a little challenge.
- Oh, my God.<br/>- Whoa! He's calling his shot.
Whatever girl I'm pointing to right now,<br/>that's who I'm going home with tonight.
And,
play ball!
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
Hey. How'd the date with Dale go?
You know, sometimes that guy,<br/>with the horn-rimmed glasses
and a Smurfs T-shirt, is just being ironic.
Sometimes he is a dork with a lazy eye
and a love-hate relationship<br/>with Gargamel.
Robin, just because a guy talks a lot<br/>about a fictional character on a first date,
doesn't mean he's not husband material.
Sasquatch isn't fictional.
TED: That was quick.
So, night one was pretty routine.
Jim, there's nothing routine<br/>about the way I get down.
Respect. Take us to night two.
See that hotty over there<br/>nursing a Black Russian?
She's about to chase that<br/>with a white American. Up top!
You know, if you're not careful,<br/>you're gonna lose me.
Hey, guys, what should I say<br/>when Dale calls for a second date?
How do you know he's gonna call?
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
You're cute, Marshall,
but I think Mama knows<br/>when a dude's digging the show.
I mean, he couldn't keep<br/>his good eye off of me.
Well, let him down easy.<br/>People are fragile.
Sometimes without even meaning to,
you might rip someone's beating heart out<br/>and stomp on it
in a roomful of 26 people<br/>and a teacher's assistant.
- How did school go today, Ted?<br/>- Something bad happened.
It was the first class of the new semester.
Jamie Adamic? Hi.
Brian Glowatz, Glowatz? Hi.
Well done.<br/>Adding a fake name to the sign-up sheet.
That's real original, guys.
You know, I'd expect inspired minds<br/>such as yours to be a little more mature
and, frankly, more creative.
I mean, seriously,<br/>what kind of a fake name is Cook Pu?
Here.
Come on, guys.<br/>It's gotta at least sound real. Cook Pu?
Here.
Whatever happened to classics, right.<br/>You know, Seymour Butts?
Hugh Gerection? Those were fake names.<br/>But Cook Pu?
- (CRYING) Here.<br/>- Cook Pu!
She's back here, bro.
All right, come on. Let me have it.<br/>Bring on all the Cook Pu jokes.
Oh, we're not gonna make jokes, Ted.
That girl must be<br/>really down in the dumps.
You really smeared the Pu name.
You guys finished?
Are you asking us<br/>if all the Pu is out of our system?
Wow, back-to-back nights.<br/>Barney is on fire.
(SIGHING) That girl's lucky.<br/>Barney was the best sex I ever had.
And he's the best friend I've ever had.
- He's everything I want Marshall to be.<br/>- He's everything I wish I could be.
I'm just assuming that's what they say<br/>when I'm not around.
I buy it. You're awesome.
Now, night three. Paint us a word picture.
Jim, I could tell I was on a roll,<br/>so I decided to mix things up a little bit.
- I think I'm gonna go small boobs tonight.<br/>- You're disgusting.
Lily, they're people, too.
- Here's your burgers.<br/>- Thank you.
- Thanks.<br/>- You're welcome.
What, you're not sharing?<br/>You two always share a burger.
No, we don't.
We're not, like, weirdoes<br/>who share everything.
- Yeah, you are.<br/>- That's exactly what you are.
We're perfectly normal!
Guys, what's going on?
You know how Lily and I have<br/>been looking for new couple friends
ever since we lost Robin and Barney,<br/>and Ted and Stella,
and Ted and Robin, and Ted and Victoria?
Geez, Ted, when are you<br/>gonna get your life together?
How'd we end up here?
We went on a great double date last night.
We were cool. We were casual.<br/>We didn't spaz out.
And then one tiny little detail came out
- and the whole night was ruined.<br/>- Ruined!
And Joanna's toothbrush<br/>flips off the side of the sink,
hits the ceiling<br/>and falls right into the toilet.
Come on. That's crazy.
Last week, the same thing happened<br/>to our toothbrush.
"Our" toothbrush?
"Our" toothbrush?
"Our" toothbrush?
- Yeah.<br/>- Like, one toothbrush?
That you both use?
Every day?
Is that weird?
ALL: Super weird.
Marshall, four out of five dentists<br/>just threw up in their mouths.
(ROBIN SHUDDERS IN DISGUST)
Hey, check it out.<br/>Barney's leaving with another girl.
Wow, three girls in three nights?<br/>That's gross even for Barney.
Gross? Are you kidding?<br/>He's on his way to a Perfect...
Oh! (MUTTERING) Don't say it! You'll jinx it.
Jinx what?
I was on my way toward
a Perfect Week!
The Perfect Week.<br/>Seven nights, seven girls, zero rejections.
Incredible. I mean,<br/>it's really like the sexual equivalent
of baseball's perfect game. But even rarer.
Yeah. The only player in history<br/>to have ever achieved both
was Mustache Pete Drexel, back in 1896.
Now this wasn't the first time<br/>you'd come close to a Perfect Week.
You learn the hard way, though.<br/>One mistake, and it's all over.
NANTZ: Sometimes,<br/>a teammate makes an error.
Sometimes, one wild pitch...
You, me, the canned-food aisle<br/>in the bodega next door.
... leads to a walk.
And sometimes, you just lose focus,<br/>and it almost always leads to a hit.
(EX CLAIMING)
But this week, you were three-for-three,<br/>with no sign of slowing down.
I could do no wrong.
Wish I could say the same for my friends.
Cook didn't show up for class today.
I'm sorry, Cook?
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,<br/>a ton of people named Cook.
Yeah.
Cook Pu.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Uh-oh. Here we go. The dreaded Dale call.
Oh! It's my mom.
She's going through some<br/>pretty major league health stuff.
God, why won't that guy call?
- Wait a minute, you want him to call?<br/>- No. Shut up.
Don't you guys have, like,<br/>a toothbrush to share, or something?
Yeah. When did you guys<br/>even start doing that anyway?
Like, years ago. You should know.<br/>We lived with you.
Yeah, but you always kept your toothbrush<br/>in the bedroom.
Also weird, by the way.
No, we kept it in the bathroom.
No. There was only one toothbrush<br/>in the bathroom, and it was mine.
Wait. Are you saying that for eight years,
all three of you shared one toothbrush?
- Oh, my God.<br/>- TED: Kill me!
- I love this so much!<br/>- Kill me!
So, you're through four nights.<br/>You're over the hump.
- Nice, Jim.<br/>- Hey, I try. I'm no you.
But then came night five,<br/>and with it, trouble.
Beer here!
Thanks.
Hey, how's Barney doing tonight?
Cool as a cucumber,<br/>just like he's been all week.
- Yeah? That's hard to believe.<br/>- Why?
Apparently, this big merger<br/>fell through last week,
and Barney's being blamed for it.
That's weird. He hasn't said anything.
Look, I work with the guy.<br/>I didn't find out until this afternoon,
when I walked by his boss's office.
You cost this company, Stinson!
MARSHALL: I've never seen Barney<br/>look that scared.
I think he's gonna get fired.
I can't believe Barney might get fired.
Yeah, they're having a meeting on Friday
to determine whether or not<br/>he keeps his job.
Poor guy. He must be freaking out.
- I'm gonna go talk to him.<br/>- Wait, no!
You can't distract the man<br/>in the middle of you know what!
Oh, come on! This is his career!
This is much more important<br/>than some stupid Perfect...
(EX CLAIMING)
Okay.
You can lick my hand<br/>as long as you want.
I'm not gonna let you ruin his...<br/>(EX CLAIMING)
- Guys, we need to talk to him.<br/>- I'll go. He needs a bro.
- Hey, buddy.<br/>- Hey.
- Everything all right?<br/>- Absolutely. Sure. Top of the world.
(SIGHING) Who am I kidding?<br/>I need your help.
Anything, buddy. What is it?
(SIGHING)
Which one of these girls<br/>looks the dumbest?
All right, kid.<br/>Let's check the scouting report.
What about the heater?
High and outside?
All right. I'd go with the slider.
- Thanks, Skip.<br/>- Yo.
So, what'd he say?
Hmm? Oh!
Yeah, he's gonna take a swat<br/>at that hamburglar over there.
You were supposed to talk to him<br/>about losing his job.
Lily, how is forcing him to dwell on<br/>a problem he can do nothing about
- gonna help him?<br/>- How is ignoring it gonna solve anything?
Well, you ignored good dental hygiene<br/>for the better part of a decade
- and you seem...<br/>- Cook Pu!
- Cook Pu.<br/>- Dale call yet?
- No. Why are you...<br/>- Guys, guys, guys, look!
Barney, we gotta stop you for a second.<br/>There's something I have to ask.
Have you ever used<br/>performance-enhancing drugs?
No, sir. I respect the game too much.
Although, I can't say<br/>I haven't been offered.
(LILY HUMMING)
Dude, it was pretty awesome.
You should try it. I have some more.
- No, thanks.<br/>- You sure?
All right. Suit yourself.
What time is it?
- It's 8:00.<br/>- 8:00?
I need to go to the hospital.
I've never touched the stuff.<br/>You can test me if you want to, Nantz.
Barney, I trust you. I regret<br/>I even asked you the question, okay.
Let's go to night six.<br/>Two girls away from perfection.
- Honest to God.<br/>- Hey. Hey.
Dude, what are you doing here?<br/>Get down to the bar.
Ted, relax. I'm already six-for-six.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
I was lunching at Tavern on the Green.
I started chatting up<br/>this Swedish supermodel.
Next thing you know,<br/>I'm playing a day game
in the back of a horse-drawn carriage.
Giddy-what-up.
(MIMICS HORSE WHINNYING)
(SNORTING)
Awesome. What really happened?
I had lunch at a Staten Island Chili's<br/>and banged a drunk hairdresser.
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?
Barney, we know you might get fired.<br/>Wait. You have to talk about this.
You are just using meaningless sex<br/>to distract yourself
- from a really serious issue.<br/>- It is not meaningless, okay?
Number five and I really connected.
She's going back to school,<br/>or has a kid in school,
something about school!
So, today, one of my students told me<br/>Cook is dropping my class.
Oh, my God. Pu dropped out?
She is flushing her education<br/>down the toilet.
Any word from Dale?
It's only been five days. He's gonna call.
Why do you care anyway?<br/>You said he was a total dork.
Do not talk about Dale that way, okay!<br/>He is twice the man you will ever be!
And God forbid, if you can't find<br/>another job, sell your place.
Marshall and I have an extra room.<br/>You can stay there as long as you need.
Make sure you bring your own toothbrush.
Lily, what are you doing?
Talking to my friend<br/>who's going through a really tough time.
He's doing fine.
Trying to sleep with seven women<br/>in seven nights is not doing fine.
It's a cry for help.
Barney's whole life is a cry for help.
But you don't mess with a man<br/>when he's in the middle of a...
What? Perfect Week?
(ALL GASPING)
Perfect Week! Perfect Week! Perfect Week!<br/>Grow up!
(BARNEY HISSING)
Unbelievable. You know,<br/>there's two things you don't do.
One, you don't open an e-mail<br/>from Phil Simms in front of your kids.
And two, you don't jinx a man<br/>going for a Perfect Week.
I don't know what to tell you.<br/>Lily's always messing with me.
I think she has a thing for the Barnacle.
You're a keen observer<br/>of the human condition, Jim Nantz.
- I can't believe you jinxed him.<br/>- He doesn't stand a chance out there.
Okay, question. If I ruined everything,
why is Barney totally hitting it off<br/>with third-martini-girl over there?
- Oh, my God!<br/>- He's gonna do it.
Yeah. See,<br/>there is no such thing as a jinx.
(ALL EX CLAIMING)
Tell me she didn't say,<br/>"There's no such thing as a jinx."
Wish I could.
You were about to achieve<br/>something so beautiful.
Well, thanks to her, the only thing<br/>that could ruin a surefire hook-up
was about to walk through that door.
BARNEY: A member of the 2009<br/>World Champion New York Yankees.
Lily, I'm getting my own toothbrush.
Well, I guess that's it.<br/>Barney's streak ends at six.
What? Why? Because that guy<br/>with the weird hair just walked in?
That's Nick Swisher.<br/>He's a New York Yankee.
No normal guy in New York City<br/>can compete with a Yankee.
And it doesn't even have to be<br/>a current Yankee. When I first moved here,
I was on a fourth date<br/>with a girl I really liked,
until I got rack-jacked by Phil Rizzuto.
- I was there. Holy cow, that guy had game.<br/>- TED: Mmm-hmm.
No, I'm not seeing it.
Okay, let me try<br/>to Canada this up for you, eh?
How would you react<br/>if one of those Cachuck guys
with the skates and the sticks<br/>walked in here?
Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks<br/>walked in here,
my panties would drop so hard<br/>there would be a hole in the floor
halfway to China.
- That's what it's like with the Yankees.<br/>- Barney's screwed.
It's happening. Look.
Hey, wanna come over<br/>and look at my snow globe collection?
- Snow globe collection?<br/>- He's throwing junk out there!
That is Nick Swisher.
(ALL GROANING)
- Good effort.<br/>- Good game. Good game.
- Good game. Good game.<br/>- Not good enough.
This whole week was a waste.
And tomorrow, I'm gonna get fired.
I'm really sorry, dude.
But for what it's worth,<br/>this week wasn't a waste.
We were all having a really horrible week<br/>and you took our minds off it.
Yeah. I had my first student drop my class.<br/>It sucked.
I met my soul mate<br/>and he never called me back.
I mean, yet. He will. He will.
We scared off a really great couple<br/>just because we share a toothbrush.
You share a toothbrush!
- Well, them and Ted.<br/>- What?
Wait a second. When we were dating<br/>you borrowed that toothbrush all the time.
Oh, my God.
OLDER TED: And that's when Aunt Lily<br/>realized what's great about sports.
They take your mind off your troubles,<br/>if only for a moment.
And deep down,<br/>we all needed that Perfect Week.
TED: The second she sits down<br/>next to Swisher it's all over.
Wait a minute!<br/>Aldrin's got a bead on her!
She's running out of room.<br/>She dives, and...
And I have no idea<br/>where she's going with this.
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?<br/>- Yeah. Sorry, I'm such a klutz.
Oh! Thanks.<br/>(GROANING) I think I twisted my ankle.
- Can you get me some ice?<br/>- Of course.
Oh, my God. She did it!<br/>I guess there is no such thing as a jinx!
Oh, I'll get you some ice, Lily.
Damn it! Swisher's back in play.
- Swisher's back in play!<br/>- Follow me.
Hey, Nick Swisher, this guy<br/>and his wife share a toothbrush!
- So?<br/>- So, that's weird, right?
Actually, I think it's kind of sweet.
In a way, aren't we all trying to find<br/>that special someone
to share a toothbrush with?
Excuse me.<br/>Lily, Nick Swisher thinks we're sweet.
Martini?
We're having a beer with<br/>a New York Yankee. How cool is that!
Oh! It's amazing. I totally follow baseball.
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?
Yeah, baseball, it's amazing.<br/>But I tell you one thing, it's no hockey.
I live right upstairs.
What do you say we go back to my place?
(CHUCKLES) Wow, to be honest,<br/>I don't normally do that,
but I feel a real connection here, Seven.<br/>Christy.
Please.
I did it!
(ALL CHEERING)
I did it!
Amazing!<br/>Congratulations on your Perfect Week.
Thanks, Jim. I couldn't have done it<br/>without my teammates.
Hey, on to a new topic.
Do you really think<br/>you might get fired today?
(STAMMERING)
Jim, I...<br/>I told you I don't want to talk about that.
Barney, I'm a figment of your imagination,<br/>so, apparently, you do. Think about that.
- What a jerk!<br/>- You're a jerk.
Mr. Donovan will see you now.
Stinson, we've reached a decision.
We're keeping you on.
(SIGHING)
I know this past week<br/>must've been tough on you.
(CHUCKLES) I barely slept.
Here you go, guys,<br/>the official hat of Barney's Perfect Week.
I was gonna do shirts,<br/>but then you have to guess sizes,
and feelings get hurt. It's a mess.
In commemoration of Barney's<br/>induction into the Hall of Game,
this tie worn on the seventh night<br/>of his Perfect Week is hereby retired.
May Barney's heroic feat<br/>be remembered and spoken of
for generations to come.
I'm totally gonna<br/>sit my kids down one day,
and tell them about the time Uncle Barney<br/>nailed seven chicks in a row.
(ALL LAUGHING)
OLDER TED: Am I a bad dad?
Take-out order for Cook Pu.
We have a number two over here<br/>for Cook Pu.
You guys got Wendy saying it now?
Come on, okay, I get it.<br/>Cook Pu is a stupid name,
and it gets stupider and stupider<br/>the more you say it.
Cook Pu. Cook Pu. Cook Pu.
Here.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, I remember one time<br/>we all gathered at my apartment
to watch the Super Bowl.
Well, not all of us.
TV ANNOUNCER: Welcome back<br/>to Super Bowl XLIVin Miami.
Get a load of that guy.
You think that's his real number?
- Well, that explains where Barney is.<br/>- Dibs on his wings.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hi.
Does anyone know<br/>who won the Super Bowl?
You were there. It was the...
- I won.<br/>- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
Because I am now in possession<br/>of a magic phone that always rings.
And do you know who's always, usually,<br/>on the other end? A chick.
So how many chicks<br/>do I have calling me now?
Infinity!
You guys remember Ranjit.
- Hello.<br/>- Hey, Ranjit. Good to see you.
I've enlisted Ranjit's services<br/>as my personal driver
because for the next week,<br/>I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women,
and I don't wanna take the subway,<br/>'cause, you know, germs.
What, you're actually gonna<br/>hook up with these girls that call you?
Oh, indubitably.
I'm meeting the first one here any minute.<br/>Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater.
Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic,<br/>and wants to 96 me.
Semi-colon, end parentheses.
This ought to be good.<br/>I can only imagine the quality of girl that...
Oh, my God, you are the guy<br/>from the Super Bowl!
Magic phone, guys. Magic phone.
ROBIN: Hey, guys. Hey, Ranjit.
- Hello.<br/>- Hey.
- How's it goin'?<br/>- Hey.
- That beer looks a little flat.<br/>- It's scotch.
Whoa! Something troubling you, kiddo?
(SIGHS) Don.
OLDER TED: Don was Aunt Robin's co-host<br/>on her morning show.
Now, even though<br/>her show was on so early
that no one watched, Aunt Robin<br/>was a consummate professional.
But Don was not.
Oh, yeah.
But that morning, Don had gone too far.
Now that's what I call having<br/>a"woof" over your head.
Don?
Don?
Why is Ulee's Gold in every crossword?
Oh, it's me? Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Next Sunday is Valentine's Day.
And one lucky patient will be receiving<br/>a very special chocolate heart,
a human heart.
Hey, that reminds me,<br/>I have been meaning to ask you.
Robin, do you have<br/>any Valentine's Day plans?
- He asked you out?<br/>- He asked me out.
That's crazy.
And they use "Ulee"<br/>because of the vowels.
Ah. What did you say?
Well, we were on the air.<br/>I was on the spot, so I said okay.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Robin, you are gonna marry this guy<br/>so freaking hard, right in the butt.
What? No! I hate Don!
And now I can't cancel because I said<br/>I would go out with him on the air.
What would your viewer think?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You said you'd go out with him<br/>on Valentine's? I thought we had plans.
What? Getting drunk<br/>and cleaning the apartment was a plan?
I did not say it was a good plan.
Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now.
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)<br/>- And it is getting interesting.
Look at these texts. Read this one.
Yowza! Now look at this one.
Does she text her mother<br/>with those fingers?
Now look at this one.
Or this one. Or this one. Or this one.
Okay, okay, okay, buddy.
How about you do this?<br/>Go nail that girl, then read your texts.
I can't do that, Ted.<br/>I just can't hook up with a girl
if there is a hotter girl out there<br/>with whom up can be hooked.
Isn't there always a hotter girl?
I know. Isn't it wonderful?
Go for Barney.<br/>Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?
Oh, hi, Mom.
There's always a hotter girl.<br/>Isn't that the problem, in a nutshell?
There's too many options.<br/>You got Internet dating. You got bars.
Holding up your phone number<br/>on national TV.
I never had that problem.
When I was 18,<br/>I had an arranged marriage.
And I love my wife more and more<br/>every day.
It is true.
It is very rare that two people<br/>just meet and fall madly in love.
Like Robin and Don.
But we're not even, like,<br/>going out for dinner.
We're just hanging out at his place.
LILY AND TED: Ooh!
No, it's not like that!<br/>It's just us and a bunch of other people.
Wait. Robin, what exactly did Don say<br/>when he asked you out?
I'm having some friends over<br/>to my place for a little party.
You should come by if you want.
I... Okay.
Robin, Don didn't ask you out.
Of course he asked me out.
- No, he didn't.<br/>- Yes, he did.
- He did. He did! He did!<br/>- Okay.
Well, dog my cats.<br/>I think I know what's going on here.
Robin, did you want Don to ask you out?
What? No! I hate Don!
I can't stop thinking about<br/>how much I hate him!
It's like... It's like, all the time.<br/>I just wanna attack him,
and rip his stupid clothes off,
and just spank him with his little paddle<br/>until his bum's all red.
Shut up!
See? That right there<br/>is what free will gets you.
Constant, ego-shattering uncertainty.
I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has.
I've spent my entire adult life<br/>looking for the perfect woman,
and I'm spending Valentine's Day<br/>scrubbing the toilet.
I need someone else<br/>to find me that woman.
Marshall, Lily, "arranged marriage" me.
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)<br/>- Or this one. Or this one. Or this one.
- You want us to arrange your marriage?<br/>- Absolutely.
Look, there's two sides to dating, right?<br/>Picking and getting picked.
Getting picked, I'm good at.<br/>Ladies love Teddy West Side.
You're waiting for me to comment<br/>on your self-assigned nickname.
Well, here's my comment.
- I love it!<br/>- Really?
Teddy West Side, continue.
It's the picking I suck at.<br/>I pick the wrong girls.
But, you guys,<br/>you're the best pickers I know.
You picked each other.
Well, with a slight assist from<br/>the Wesleyan housing department.
And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir.
Get out there. Find me a girl.<br/>We'll double date on Valentine's Day.
If I like her, I will marry her.<br/>If she's cool with it.
And she will be<br/>'cause I'll wear my nice blazer.
I love that blazer<br/>almost as much as Robin loves Don.
- I do not love Don.<br/>- Robin, neurologically speaking,
the part of the human brain<br/>that makes you hate people
is located right next<br/>to the part of the brain
that makes you wanna<br/>jump people's bones.
The two responses are so similar<br/>it's hard to tell them apart.
You know what it's like?
Wait, I have to get a book.<br/>Give me 30 seconds.
Okay, this is fun.<br/>Look at this picture. It's a rabbit.
You can look at it for hours<br/>and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit.
But then one day, you look at it,
and you realize,<br/>"Wait a second, it's a duck."
It's a rabbit. It's a duck.<br/>Rabbit. Duck. Rabbit. Duck.
Isn't this fun?
OLDER TED: It sure was.
Relationships are like that.
I mean, look, when you first met Don,<br/>you hated him.
You thought, "This guy's a duck."
But one of these days,<br/>you're gonna realize,
"This is actually something that I love.<br/>He's a rabbit."
I think you got it backwards there, buddy.
The duck is the thing you love.
- The rabbit is the thing you hate.<br/>- What?
Yeah, I gotta agree.<br/>Ducks up, rabbits down.
Definitely, ducks are better than rabbits.
Are you guys... Ducks are... Ducks are...
Rabbits are adorable. Ducks are, well...
Have you ever been in a fight with a duck?<br/>I mean, ducks are jerks.
OLDER TED: This led to one of the most<br/>intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey!
- We're not talking about flavor, Ted!<br/>- Flavor counts!
Who carries around a duck's foot<br/>for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in a comforter<br/>stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one<br/>stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
- Okay.<br/>- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on! I have to get another book!
(SPEAKING PERSIAN)
Then why don't we take a rabbit, a duck,
stick 'em in a cardboard box,<br/>and let them fight it out?
- Because it's illegal, Ted!<br/>- Only if we bet on it, Marshall!
Fine!
I concede! You win.
Say it.
You have to say it.
Ducks are good.
Rabbits are bad.
- Yeah! So good!<br/>- Yes!
Thank you.<br/>And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin.
Think about it. Don, Donald, Donald Duck.
(MARSHALL GASPS)
And what, I wonder,<br/>does Donald Duck never wear?
- Pants.<br/>- Pants.
Don's a duck.
(BOTH EXHALING)
- Permission to say "lawyered"?<br/>- I'll allow it.
Lawyered.
OLDER TED: Yes, kids. Sometimes<br/>there's a fine line between love and hate.
Case in point...
There is no place I would rather be,<br/>and no one I'd rather be with.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I should get that.
Go for Barney.
Look, I'm sorta in the middle of someone,<br/>something, right now, and...
You're a hot lady bullfighter?
You gotta go.
- MacLaren's Pub.<br/>- MacLaren's Pub.
Well, hello.
There's no place I would rather be,<br/>and no one I would rather be...
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Would you excuse me for one moment?
Go for Barney. Look, I...
You're a gold-medalist<br/>Japanese figure skater?
(BIDDING FAREWELL IN SPANISH)
- MacLaren's Pub!<br/>- MacLaren's Pub!
Well, hello.
No place I'd rather be, no one I'd rather...
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh! For Pete's sake!
You're a hot chick?
(BIDDING FAREWELL IN JAPANESE)
- MacLaren's Pub!<br/>- MacLaren's Pub!
Well, hello.
I realize that you're very busy,<br/>so I'll just get straight to the point.
Okay.
(EX CLAIMING)
(GASPING)
(EX CLAIMING)
And that's my bad leg.
Very bad.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(LAUGHING) Are you okay?
Yeah, of course. Why... Why wouldn't I be?
Go for Barney.
OLDER TED: Barney had been sure<br/>that phone was something he loved.
But now he realized it wasn't that at all.
It was something else entirely.
(SCREAMS)
(GROANING)
I'm free!
Ah, now this feels right.
There is no place I would rather be,<br/>and no one I would rather be...
(CELL PHONE RINGING IN THE DISTANCE)
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
- Hear what?<br/>- (SHUSHING)
(CELL PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)
(EX CLAIMS)
- MacLaren's Pub!<br/>- MacLaren's Pub!
(SOBBING)
Go for Barney.
D-cups? Really?
OLDER TED: Finally,<br/>Valentine's Day arrived,
the deadline for Marshall and Lily<br/>to find me a wife,
an important job they had,<br/>well, forgotten to do.
Aren't we supposed to go<br/>on a double date with Ted?
Ted, no. He's not seeing anyone.<br/>Remember, he asked us to find...
Oh, no.
Hey, hey. Wanna get married?
I don't know what kind of architect.<br/>Houses, buildings, that kind of crap.
Want to marry my friend, Ted?
Wanna marry my friend, Ted?<br/>Wanna marry my friend, Ted?
What, you can be choosey?<br/>You're in a bar on Valentine's Day, huh?
Hey, just real quick.
(SCREAMS)
MARSHALL: You wanna marry my friend,<br/>Ted?
- Man, Ted's right. It's tough out there.<br/>- This is stupid.
You know what? We forgot about this.<br/>I'm sure Ted did also.
(SINGING) Here comes the groom
In his favorite blazer
Gonna meet my wife and I'm...
Laser, Taser, gazer... Blazer...
- ROBIN: Hey, Ted.<br/>- Yeah.
ROBIN: Before you go meet<br/>your future wife,
why don't you swing by Don's party<br/>with me?
That's what you're wearing?
- Yeah. Why?<br/>- He's a duck.
That dude be straight duckin'.
(SINGING) And I think that I'll amaze her
Nailed it!
OLDER TED: So, we went to Don's party.
Look, Robin, I don't wanna crowd you<br/>on your little date here,
so if things start to get<br/>hot and heavy with Don...
- They're not gonna get hot...<br/>- I'm just saying, if they do, I'll just say,
"Well, I got a dinner rez," and then...
Wait, this is the best part.<br/>I've been working on this for a while.
I'll duck out.
(SARCASTICALLY) Ha, ha, ha.
Okay, it's not gonna happen.
- But, yeah, do that.<br/>- Mmm.
Hello, Robin.
(SCREAMS)
Well, I got a dinner rez.
Oh, God, Don.<br/>What the hell are you doing?
I don't know.<br/>It's something called "The Naked Man."
I read about it on some guy's blog.
My God, I'm so stupid.
Why did I ever think it would work<br/>on someone like you?
Yeah. 'Cause I would never...<br/>Could, like... Standards, so...
You know. I thought this was a party.
I only said that to get you<br/>to come over here.
I didn't think you'd bring a date.
Ted's not my date. He's a friend.
Oh, God. You probably think<br/>I'm some kind of playboy now, right?
You could say that.
So, he's a rabbit.<br/>At least you know for sure.
Ted, this may hurt a little.
I'm recycling your<br/>old Architecture Weekly magazines.
- What are you doing?<br/>- Cleaning.
You go on your date.<br/>Happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh! Thank God you're here.<br/>- Yeah. I've been thinking.
- Maybe we should call this whole thing off.<br/>- No. Ted. We got her.
- What?<br/>- We got her. It's the craziest thing.
We were searching all week,<br/>and then, a couple of hours ago...
- Trudy?<br/>- Married.
- Blah, blah?<br/>- Committed.
- Relationship?<br/>- Bellevue.
Natalie?
Ted's her least favorite person<br/>in the world.
Well, she's not getting any younger.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Get rid of it!<br/>- What?
This phone is cursed. Cursed, I tell you!
I try to ignore it,<br/>but it just never stops ringing!
It's ruining my life!
I should get that.
No. Please! Please!<br/>Please, Marshall. Let me answer it.
It could be an emergency.<br/>She could be trapped in a giant bra!
Barney, Barney, let it go to voicemail.
(SOBBING)
I should let go.
Okay.
We have to find Ted a wife.<br/>We're being too choosey.
It almost doesn't matter<br/>who it is at this point.
Okay.
- It's a phone girl?<br/>- I know, I know.
No. But, no, then we met her.<br/>And, Ted, she's a world-class violinist.
She's a gourmet cook.
And she can quote every line<br/>from Caddyshack!
Wow.
Hello, Ted.
"And what brings you<br/>to this nape of the woods?
"Neck of the wape? Why are you here?"
OLDER TED: So, we all had dinner.
And, kids, Lily and Marshall's<br/>hard work had paid off,
because that girl was terrific. In fact...
Oh, but, Natalia, tell Ted the problem.
Yeah. Yeah. Tell him. Tell him.
Well, unfortunately, I'm going<br/>to have to leave the country soon
because my visa is about to expire.
She needs to get married.
Federal law expressly dictates<br/>that a foreign national
can't maintain residency for longer than<br/>six months without a work visa. Sorry.
OLDER TED: But when it came down to it...
And you, sir, the rabbit or the duck?
- What?<br/>- It's a prix fixe menu for Valentine's Day,
and we're already out of<br/>the steak, fish and chicken.
So, rabbit or duck?
Rabbit. Sorry, guys. I gotta go.
Why would Ted order rabbit<br/>if he was just gonna run out?
I need it back! Where's the phone?
Well, hello. Oh, I met you already.
Where's the phone?
- It's hidden.<br/>- Where?
OLDER TED: Where had Aunt Lily<br/>hidden the phone?
Well, to answer that question,<br/>we have to back up a little bit.
You go on your date.<br/>Happy Valentine's Day.
(BARNEY'S CELL PHONE RINGING)
Barney's phone.<br/>I wonder how it got in there.
Ted? Come on, big date.
Well, what's the harm? Hello?
OLDER TED: And just like that,<br/>I was hooked.
Terrific. I will see you there.<br/>And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer.
(LAUGHING)
I think you'll know the blazer<br/>when you see it.
- I gotta go.<br/>- Thank God you're here.
So, rabbit or duck?
Rabbit. Sorry, guys. I gotta go.
Well, hello.
Sorry, babe. I gotta take this.
Barney's phone.<br/>Teddy West Side speaking.
This is my phone! I'm taking it back!<br/>And I'm taking your cool nickname, too.
- Barney West Side speaking.<br/>- No, no, no, no, wait. I love it so much!
It just keeps ringing<br/>and ringing and ringing.
Give it to me! Give it to me. It's mine.<br/>It's mine. It's mine now.
- It's mine!<br/>- Give me the phone!
Lily. Lily, no! No!
(TED SCREAMS)
Oops.
- Being single sucks.<br/>- Mmm.
Turns you into a crazy person.
I know. So much running around<br/>and freaking out, and for what?
It's all so you can find someone<br/>you can sit on a couch
and put off cleaning the bathroom with.
Well, the joke's on the rest of the world<br/>because we can do that on our own.
- Exactly.<br/>- Exactly.
- Robin, I have to apologize.<br/>- Save it. Let's just do the news.
No, listen. After you left the other night,<br/>I was embarrassed.
Not because I was naked.<br/>I'm actually pretty okay with my body.
Clearly.
I got married in college.
I just got divorced three months ago.<br/>I have no idea how to be single.
But that's not why I was embarrassed.
I was embarrassed<br/>about my behavior right here, at Channel...
It starts with a one.
- Twelve.<br/>- Twelve.
I mean, just look at your mug.
Right. Well, no, you look at this mug.
You are a tremendous news anchor.
And you deserve a co-anchor<br/>who gives a crap.
And from here on out, that's gonna be me.
Well, I'll believe that when I see it.
Well, you'll see it right now.
I'll go get you some coffee.
Don.
You're wearing pants.
Well, look at that.
Aw, duck.

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, in many of my stories,
I'm a starry-eyed romantic<br/>on a noble search for true love.
In this one, I'm just a jerk.
Well, guys, tonight is the night.
I'm inviting Tiffany up to my place<br/>to see my antique camera collection.
- It's Ted's bait.<br/>- Bait?
A true gentleman invents a pretense to<br/>lure an honorable lady into his apartment,
some item of interest or beauty you can<br/>both pretend to admire for five minutes
before she hops on your disco stick.
Right. She's coming up to borrow a book,<br/>or check out an album on vinyl.
Or to see your new rap poster.
(SCOFFS) Rap poster?<br/>Who would that work on?
It was the first week of college.<br/>I was really into Wu-Tang Clan.
Yeah, bait is tricky.
It has to be something interesting enough<br/>to get the girl upstairs,
but not so interesting<br/>that it overpowers the night.
BARNEY: I found that<br/>a slot machine was too fun.
(EX CLAIMING)
And a trampoline<br/>turned out to be too dangerous.
But then I found the perfect bait.
- A teacup pig.<br/>- (GRUNTING)
Oh...
A teacup pig? Who's that working on?
- You have a teacup pig?<br/>- You have a teacup pig?
Can we see the teacup pig?
- Can I borrow your teacup pig?<br/>- Yes, you can borrow my teacup pig.
You have a teacup pig? Oh, my gosh,<br/>I can't believe you have a teacup pig.
You're just so cute.<br/>Yes, you are the cutest piggy ever.
What?
Were you always this pretty?<br/>Or are you gonna give me that whole
"Oh, in high school,<br/>I was really shy and awkward" line?
I was shy and awkward.
I was like 100 pounds heavier<br/>and I had these crazy buck teeth.
- Seriously?<br/>- No.
I've always been hot.<br/>What are you gonna do?
Do you know who else would love<br/>this teacup pig?
Hmm.
My boyfriend.
You have a boyfriend?
I know. So annoying, right?<br/>I mean, he's not really my boyfriend.
- Oh, good.<br/>- I mean, technically, he kind of is.
- Well, is he or isn't he?<br/>- Some of both, but definitely not neither.
Are you getting any of this?
Look, I really like you.
I just need you to be patient.<br/>I don't want to lose you, big brown eyes.
Yep. Somebody doesn't want to lose<br/>"big brown eyes."
Oh, Ted. She's got you on the hook.
- What? What? I'm not on the hook.<br/>- Oh, you are totally on the hook.
She's stringing you along,<br/>but she's not committing to you,
but she's keeping you around, just in case,<br/>like an old can of chili in the pantry.
Um... Who's buying canned chili<br/>and not eating it immediately?
Amen, sister.
But, Ted, don't feel bad.<br/>We've all been there.
I've been on both sides of it.<br/>I've been a hookee and a hooker.
Move past it, guys.
I've been a little bit loose,<br/>but money never changed hands.
I've been on the hook.
Lisa Walker. Picture it.<br/>1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.
So, I was, like, thinking, Lisa,
do you maybe want to,<br/>like, go out with me?
That sounds great.
But I'm sort of seeing this guy.
He's got a LeBaron convertible<br/>and an in at the roller rink,
so I'd hate to burn that bridge.
I understand.
But how about this?
You can be my secret boyfriend<br/>who does all my homework for me.
All right.
You want to see my rap poster?
Poster whore!
Anyway, Lisa Walker<br/>strung me along for months
until, one night, I went to go tell her<br/>how much I loved her,
(ALL EX CLAIMING IN ADMIRATION)
In song.
(ALL EX CLAIMING IN DISDAIN)
MARSHALL: She wasn't home yet,<br/>so I waited.
And waited.
I woke up four hours later<br/>covered in snow,
and that's when I saw it,
Lisa 's footsteps.
She had walked right over me<br/>and into the house.
It was the best thing<br/>that could've happened.
It got me off her hook.
Okay, that is definitely not<br/>what's going on with me and Tiffany.
Listen to this.
I'm really into you.
I just can't be with you right now.
Eh? Eh?
Ted, "right now" is the classic<br/>on-the-hook catchphrase.
Yep. "Right now" paints a picture of<br/>some sort of magical future time
when everything will work out.
But the truth is that will never happen.
It's like this,<br/>"I can't be with you." Boom! "Right now."
(IMITATING DOOR CREAKING OPEN)
Yeah, I think my high school boyfriend,<br/>Scooter, is still sort of on the hook for me.
Sort of? He totally is.
The poor guy showed up at our wedding<br/>hoping to win you back.
Yeah. It's still sometimes weird<br/>when I see him at work.
Wait, what?
Scooter works in the school cafeteria.<br/>We've talked about this.
Hey, Lily. Nice dress. Tater Tots?
(MOUTHING) I love you.
We most certainly<br/>have not talked about this!
Yes, we have.<br/>I've mentioned it tons of times.
Lunch lady Scooter.
I thought that you were referring<br/>to some sort of long overdue device
that carries around those<br/>poor, underappreciated lunch ladies.
This explains a lot.
Lunch lady Scooter was there again today.
Yeah, did you jump on that thing?<br/>Give it a ride?
No!
Really? If it were me,<br/>I'd be riding that scooter all day long
until I broke that thing in half.
So those poor women<br/>still have to walk everywhere?
Wait, Scooter is working at your school?
- Are you jealous?<br/>- No, I just feel bad for Scooter.
'Cause the only reason he took that job<br/>is he thinks he has a shot with you.
You have to make it clear that he doesn't<br/>so that he can move on,
and a real lunch lady can get her job back.
- Damn!<br/>- I've tried.
Hey, Lily.<br/>I saw you have seventh period free.
So do I. You want to run away together?
Let me be clear, Scooter,
there's no way you and I<br/>can ever be together.
Right now.
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.<br/>It's Tijuana Tuesday.
"Right now"?
You "right nowed" Scooter?
You need to let Scooter<br/>off the hook once and for all.
You're right. Day after tomorrow,<br/>that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Why not tomorrow?<br/>- Baby, I can't ruin Tijuana Tuesday.
Really? You're really gonna sit here<br/>all night watching the door
because Tiffany said<br/>she'll "try to stop by"?
Barney, I'm not gonna just give up on her.
OLDER TED: I should've given up on her.
This girl is special.
She was the devil.
Things are gonna work out with Tiffany.
No, they're not, dumbass!
Ted, let me be clear, this girl is a poison
and you need to cut her<br/>out of your life forever.
Hey, there she is.
Oh, she brought some of her co-workers.
Hang on to this girl, Ted. Hang on to her<br/>and never let go!
Ted, these are some of the hottest girls<br/>I've ever seen.
- And they all work with Tiffany?<br/>- Yep.
There can only be one explanation for this.
Ted, is Tiffany a (STUTTERS)<br/>Pharmaceutical sales rep?
- Yeah. How did you know that?<br/>- And you never thought to mention that?
What? It's just a job.
(EX CLAIMING) Just a... Just a...
- What?<br/>- Ted, throughout time,
there has always been<br/>one cutting-edge profession
to which hot girls, like Tiffany,<br/>have flocked.
- Shall I walk you through the history?<br/>- I'm gonna explicitly say no.
It all started 2.5 million years ago.
BARNEY: Man was a hunter.
So the hottest profession of the day?<br/>Gatherer.
Homo erectus, indeed.
As man mastered technology,<br/>the hottest profession of the day evolved.
I'm pretty sure it's a hernia.<br/>Can you check again?
And then man took to the skies.
And so hot women put on high heels<br/>and became stewardesses.
I am in the upright and locked position.
And then man said, " Life is hard.
"I should start taking lots<br/>of prescription drugs."
And so, hot girls rolled into doctors'<br/>offices, looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills they peddled<br/>ironically redundant.
So, now, pharma girls<br/>are today's hottest profession.
Hey, big brown eyes! How are you doing?
I'm good.
Hey, by the way,<br/>you ditch that loser boyfriend yet?
No, sir.
Touched my nose.
Dude, ditch Tiffany and join the Barnacle<br/>in a pharma girl free-for-all!
Side effects may include<br/>loss of clothing, rug burn,
shortness of breath<br/>and sore abdominals the next morning.
What in the world is up?
Hey, so, I know that you've been having<br/>trouble letting Scooter off the hook.
I decided what you need is practice.
Now, you say<br/>the problem is his cute, sad eyes?
Well...
(EX CLAIMING)
All right, shut it, woman.
Now, I want you to look at this teacup pig,
and tell him that there's no way<br/>that you could ever be with him.
Teacup pig,<br/>there is no way I can ever be with you.
Oh...
- Right now.<br/>- Oh, come on, grow a pair!
I'm sorry. But he's just so freaking cute.
I just want to cuddle him all day long.<br/>Yes, I do.
You know, it's funny, I remember when<br/>you used to say things like that about me.
- Well, I still do.<br/>- Yeah. Not as much, Lily.
Not as much.
(BARNEY LAUGHS)
Ain't no party like a pharma girl party<br/>'Cause a pharma girl party don't stop
Dude, I've already hooked up<br/>with three of them.
Fantazmo. Plus, my cholesterol is down,<br/>my Restless Leg Syndrome is cured.
I've never felt more alive! Ooh.
Guys, great news!<br/>Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend.
- Proof that I am not on the hook.<br/>- Oh, you're still on the hook.
Uh-uh. Listen to how we spent last night.
TED: First, we cuddled.
Then, we shared chocolate cake.
Then, well, I don't usually<br/>join in on locker room talk,
but I gave her a pretty sensual foot rub.
(INAUDIBLE)
And, let me guess,<br/>it didn't go any further than that.
Well, no, but...
And, tell me, did you by any chance<br/>make that chocolate cake?
It was a mix.
- Dude.<br/>- There's no shame in admitting it, Ted.
We've all been on people's hooks,<br/>and we've all kept someone on a hook.
Um, I most certainly have not.
- What? Are you joking?<br/>- What?
What about that girl<br/>from the university library, Henrietta?
Henrietta and I are just friends.
- Oh, she is so on your hook.<br/>- Absolutely not!
OLDER TED: She totally was.
I mean, we cuddled.
Ah!
OLDER TED: We shared chocolate cake.
Mmm, it's good.
She gave me foot rubs. Long ones.<br/>I'm not proud, kids.
You like having Henrietta around
for the same reason<br/>that Tiffany likes having you around.
It's a nice little ego boost.
No wonder you're such an expert<br/>about keeping people on the hook.
What about that poor camera guy<br/>you work with?
- Mike and I are just friends.<br/>- Come on!
Mmm! Oh!
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Robin, have you ever thought about<br/>taking us to the next level?
Well, if you're talking about<br/>doing my laundry, I'm on board.
- You got yourself a deal.<br/>- Mmm.
- What! I am not keeping Mike on the hook!<br/>- You are Captain Hook!
Uh, dude, I'm a girl.<br/>Okay, our girl parts are like a spider web.
Sometimes you're gonna catch stuff<br/>you don't want.
That doesn't make it okay.
Oh, and Henrietta's in no way<br/>wasting her time with you, right?
Henrietta knows that we're just friends.
In fact, I'm gonna call her up<br/>and hang out with her tonight as friends.
- Hey, Ted.<br/>- Hey.
I love you.
What? Do you want a foot massage?<br/>'Cause I've been practicing on myself.
- No, I'm good.<br/>- Okay.
I didn't know if you were hungry,<br/>so I just threw together some...
It's not a big deal.
OLDER TED: Kids, looking back,<br/>I don't know how I didn't see
that Henrietta was madly in love with me.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Hey, Ted.
Hey, Tiffany.
I'm going out of town this weekend<br/>for my friend's wedding.
Want to be my date?
I would love to.<br/>Hey, what are you doing right now?
Oh, God, no.
Awesome. Okay, I'll see you in, like,<br/>10 minutes?
Great.
Sorry, Henrietta. Something came up.<br/>Take a rain check, pal?
- Yeah, it's no problem.<br/>- All right. Hey, ho.
Oh! You're strong.
OLDER TED: What a jerk!
Henrietta, I...
Wait, where did Ted go?
I thought we were finally<br/>gonna get to meet him?
Yeah, something came up, okay, Mom?
- I told you there was no Ted.<br/>- HENRIETTA: I heard that!
OLDER TED: So there I was,
at one of the surest signs<br/>of taking a relationship to the next level,
an out-of-town wedding.<br/>It was finally happening.
- Champagne?<br/>- Ted! Oh, my gosh. I forgot to call you.
Well, whatever it is you wanted to<br/>talk about, we can talk about it now.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Um, this is Jack.<br/>He's the best man at the wedding.
We just got back together.
You know, now that I think about it,<br/>a phone call would have been nice.
You're Ted?
Ouch!
But I hear you make<br/>a mean chocolate cake.
Isn't he great? And he's in a band.
(SQUEALS)
Thanks.
Come on, Lily. You have to get Scooter<br/>off the hook. Now try again.
Teacup pig,
I don't want to be with you.
- Right now.<br/>- Man up!
Teacup pig,
I don't want to be with you.
- Ever!<br/>- Finish him!
We will never be together<br/>in any sort of sexual way ever again!
Nice.
- Sort of a weird thing to say to a pig.<br/>- It felt really wrong.
Anyway, I just don't think<br/>you and I are gonna work.
(WHISPERS) Right now.
OLDER TED: And that's when it hit me.<br/>I was on the hook. I also realized...
I missed this so much, baby.
Tiffany was on this guy's hook.<br/>It was a vicious cycle.
Henrietta was on my hook.
And years later, I found out<br/>this poor bastard was on Henrietta 's hook.
You know what?<br/>We're not gonna work, ever.
I'm done.
And it's really better for the circulation<br/>if you knead the arches with your thumbs.
Now I'm done.
- Marshall, I can do this by myself.<br/>- Okay. Well, then, prove it.
And grab me a pudding.
Listen up, Scooter, there is no way<br/>you and I will ever be together.
MARSHALL: Right now!
- Marshall!<br/>- I'm sorry. But he's adorable.
Listen, I don't want to be with you.
Right now. Hang in there, Scoots.<br/>I'm not gonna live forever.
Last night, I was with this pharma girl<br/>who was so hot
you should call a doctor if you don't have<br/>an erection for more than four hours.
Am I right, people?
Yeah, there's no people.<br/>Just the girl you most recently dated.
Hey, Barney, I want you to meet<br/>the newest pharma girl.
Gladys Reynolds.<br/>Nice to make your acquaintance.
I represent statins<br/>and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
- Come on, girl. Let's go get our drink on!<br/>- Okay.
- It's over.<br/>- What's over?
Pharma girls are no longer<br/>exclusively hot chicks.
It's the end of an era.
- You're being a little dramatic.<br/>- Am I?
It starts out with a Gladys.
Next thing you know, a few<br/>not-so-fabulous gay guys enter the ranks.
And before you know it,<br/>pharma girls look like the crew
on a Southwest flight<br/>from Albuquerque to Little Rock.
- It's over.<br/>- Okay.
OLDER TED: So that night,<br/>I went straight to Henrietta 's,
all set to let her off the hook.
This is Jack.<br/>He's the best man at the wedding.
I'm done.
Yes! The answer is yes!
- No!<br/>- Oh! It gets worse.
It's perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted proposed!
Oh, my God! I knew this day would come!
Oh! Oh!
- Son!<br/>- Yeah, well... There's been a...
No! What did you do?
I seriously considered just marrying her<br/>out of sheer awkwardness.
But I did what I had to do.
I did what anyone<br/>keeping someone on the hook should do.
I broke her heart.
Henrietta, I'm sorry if this is blunt,<br/>but I think I owe you this.
I don't want to be with you.
Right now?
Ever.
But we're still getting married, right?
- It was brutal.<br/>- Oh. I'm sorry, buddy.
Honesty is tough, but in the end,<br/>it's the far kinder alternative.
Yeah.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Mike, I have to tell you something.
- Wait, did you finish my delicates?<br/>- I got one more load.
Ah. It can wait. (CHUCKLES)
I...
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, how's it going?
Still in mourning over the end<br/>of the pharma girl era?
No. I realized that their reign had to end
to make room for some<br/>new hot girl profession.
Maybe it'll be<br/>intergalactic communications officer
on a rocket ship to some distant<br/>solar system we can't possibly imagine.
Maybe it'll be meter maids.<br/>We just don't know.
But one thing is sure.
The future glows like a giant sun
shooting amber rays of light<br/>into our hearts and minds.
Wow, what changed your mind?
The realization that<br/>hope springs eternal, Robin.
That and this little bottle of purple pills<br/>I found in my couch cushion.
I don't know what they are,<br/>(LAUGHING) but they're amazing!

</div>]

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids,<br/>on a warm March evening in 2010,
a New York City Police boat
pulled a 34-year-old white male<br/>out of the Hudson River,
your Uncle Barney.
All right, kid, let's hear the story,<br/>from the beginning.
Well, it all started a week ago.
I was making time<br/>at the local watering hole.
Enter, a dame.
Nothing sexier than a man in a fine cravat.
Except for a woman<br/>who appreciates a fine cravat.
How about we just call it a tie?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
- You see, a cravat is a kind of tie.<br/>- I get it.
Anyway, next thing you know,<br/>I get her back to my place.
Barney, when I get in bed with a man,<br/>my body becomes a machine,
fueled by desire and lust
and a singular hunger to satisfy<br/>my lover's every carnal need.
Good thing<br/>the cleaning lady's coming tomorrow.
- Well, good night.<br/>- What? Wait, what?
I thought your body was gonna<br/>become a machine,
fueled by desire, lust,
and a singular hunger to satisfy<br/>my every carnal need?
No.
(ALL LAUGHING)
You know, I really think that Don and I<br/>are hitting our stride as a news team.
MARSHALL: Yeah.<br/>DON: Well, all credit goes
to this lady on my left.
- Well, come on.<br/>- That story you did on which rodents
- to avoid on the subway...<br/>- The answer may surprise you.
It's all of them.
- I got to run, okay?<br/>- Okay.
- LILY: Well, bye.<br/>- I'll see you. It's good to meet you.
Yeah, you too. Okay. Bye, Don.
(LILY SIGHS)
Okay, Robin, that guy is awesome.
He's funny. He's smart. He's handsome.
You got to scoop him up<br/>before someone else does.
I hope you're not talking about you?
It has been four months<br/>since you broke up with Barney.
Maybe it's time<br/>to put yourself back out there.
Yeah, exactly. Barney's dating again,<br/>and he couldn't be happier.
I couldn't be more unhappy.
All night long, she's hot and heavy for me.
I get her back to my place,<br/>and she just bolts?
I mean, at least, when I run out on a girl,
I have the common courtesy<br/>to sleep with her first.
- It's called manners.<br/>- Sounds like she read that book,
Of Course You're Still Single.<br/>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut.
Well, it... It's this book that helps<br/>single girls find a husband.
It's Robin's copy. I've just...<br/>I've leafed through it a little bit.
- Is that right? Well...<br/>- LILY: Really?
- Men Are From Mars...<br/>- Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine!
Barney, when you were with this girl,
did she suddenly slip the word "sex"<br/>into the conversation?
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,<br/>and I only have a couple of sex,
before the light changes.<br/>Anyway, everyone's honking at me.
And it totally sex. But, I can't turn around,<br/>because a jogger slipped
and fell in horse sex-crement.
Go on. Go on.
Did she make excuses to establish<br/>physical contact with you?
- Is this cashmere?<br/>- Cashmere?
(SCOFFS) This is handspun virgin Merino.
The fibers in this suit<br/>are less than 12 microns thick.
Twelve microns?
I love a tiny fiber.
Well, you're in luck.<br/>'Cause mine's the tiniest.
And the more you touch it,<br/>the softer it gets.
(MOANS)
- She did that, too!<br/>- Now, here's the final test.
Next time you see her,<br/>ask her out for the following night.
The book says that's forbidden.
So, she'll probably give you<br/>some lame excuse,
like this, " Oh, I can't do anything<br/>tomorrow tonight,
"I've already made plans<br/>to clean my garbage disposal
"and treat myself to a bubble bath.
"But how about next week some time?"
Aha! You're trying that,<br/>Of Course You're Still Single.
Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut<br/>crap on me!
It's not crap!
Of Course You're Still Single.<br/>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut
is a brilliant book.
And, it scares away guys<br/>who are only interested in getting laid.
Why not just say you have a kid?
You'd be surprised<br/>how many jerks there are out there.
That's why the book says,<br/>"Never sleep with a guy on the first date."
- Totally.<br/>- "Or the second date."
- Of course.<br/>- "Or the third date."
- Well...<br/>- "Or the fourth date."
- Would you tell me how many dates?<br/>- Seventeen.
(STUTTERS)
Excuse me, is anyone using this?
(EXHALES)
Yep. Here it is.<br/>"No sex until after 17 dates."
Barney, if you're not gonna take her out<br/>on 17 dates,
- I think you should just give it up.<br/>- ROBIN: Hmm.
Oh, no. I'm not the one<br/>who's gonna give it up, she is.
- Because thanks to Ted's book...<br/>- That's Robin's. It's Robin's book.
...I can stay two steps<br/>ahead of her at all times.
There's a loophole in here somewhere,<br/>and I'm gonna find it.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Hello?<br/>- Hey, Robin.
Oh, hey, Don.
Listen, do you want to go out<br/>Saturday night?
- Saturday night?<br/>- Is he asking you out?
- Say yes! Say yes!<br/>- Look, Don, listen,
it's really sweet of you to ask.
- And you're a great guy.<br/>- Yes, I'll go out with you.
Robin, are you okay?
Um, I just have a little cold.
That's probably what you're hearing.<br/>But Saturday night sounds great.
We can even go to a steak house.
And you can bring home some prime rib<br/>for my friend Marshall.
Okay, got to go. Love you, bye.
- What the hell are you thinking?<br/>- Robin, you've got to do this, okay?
A great guy like Don is rare.
And speaking of rare, prime rib.<br/>Don't forget. Thank you.
Oh, my God. I don't believe it!
Guys, this is her! She wrote the book!
Huh. Her name must be Anita.<br/>Okay, my plan was to sleep with her.
But this changes everything.
New plan, I'm going to sleep with her.
Boy, this girl that Barney's going after,<br/>she kind of sounds like the anti-Barney.
I love how the universe decided<br/>to bring those two together.
Actually, Anita's going after Barney<br/>because I told her to.
Wait, you sicced Anita on Barney?
- How do you even know her?<br/>- She was on my show.
But, um, if you had to summarize<br/>your book, in 30 words or less.
I'll summarize it in one word, Robin.
And that word is "no."
By saying "no" constantly<br/>and consistently,
you empower yourself<br/>while simultaneously turning any jerk
into a submissive, sniveling,<br/>puddle of a man.
Hmm. And isn't that every girl's dream.
(CHUCKLES) After the break,<br/>we're gonna talk about your new book,
Of Course You Don't Have<br/>a Retirement Plan Yet.
Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut.
Due out in June. We'll be right back.
MIKE: We're clear.
- You guys want any coffee?<br/>- Thank you.
- Oh, you know what, Mike, that'd be great.<br/>- You?
No.
What about you, Robin?<br/>You dating anyone?
Oh. Dating's not really my bag right now.
Uh-oh. Did somebody break your heart?
And then, I told her everything.<br/>It just came pouring out.
And by the end of it, she said...
This Barney needs to be taught a lesson.
You say the word and I will destroy him.
- What do you mean?<br/>- I can use the power of no
to break your friend Barney.<br/>Just say the word.
Come on.<br/>That stuff doesn't really work, does it?
I didn't know what you wanted,<br/>so I got you a cappuccino,
an espresso, a latte, a decaf...<br/>Oh, hi, Robin.
- And this is a Turkish coffee.<br/>- Thank you, Mike.
Think about it.
ROBIN: I didn't think I was gonna<br/>think about it, but then,
- I thought about it.<br/>- Oh, this pilates instructor
was off the charts.
Picture Robin, but younger.<br/>And bigger boobs.
Maybe not bigger,<br/>but more shapely, and bigger.
- Hello?<br/>- I get her up against the StairMaster,
- and we...<br/>- Do it.
Spoilers! Anyway, we do it.
It's done.
Thank you, Michael.
Look, I know, it was stupid.
But you have to understand,<br/>back then I was still really upset
about the breakup.<br/>I was going through my mourning period.
There was a lot of Scotch and a lot<br/>of long nights at the shooting range.
Hmm. I hope those weren't<br/>the same nights.
Geez, Lily, it's not<br/>like I remember all of them.
Hey, babe, did you know that Robin<br/>was going through a mourning period?
I mean, she seemed fine after the breakup.
Oh, you know how she is.<br/>She tries to keep her emotions to herself.
But, yeah, I caught her crying<br/>a couple times.
She cried? Like real tears?
But that means...
Oh, no.
OLDER TED: And then Marshall realized<br/>what a jackass he'd been to Robin.
Exactly. Barney's dating again<br/>and he couldn't be happier.
I mean, that guy has been active sexually.
All right, he's just been like,<br/>bang, bang, bang!
You know, it's like,<br/>bang, bang, bang, bang.
(SINGING)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,<br/>bangity bang
I said a bang, bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>I said a bang, bang, bangity bang
How could you let me do that?
You're my wife.<br/>You're supposed to stop me
from embarrassing myself in public.
I know. But that song's kind of catchy.
(SINGING)
Bang, bang, bangity bang
Bang, bang, bangity bang
I said, bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>Bang, bang, bangity bang
Damn it! I've read the thing cover to cover<br/>and I can't find a loophole.
- What am I gonna do?<br/>- Well, there is one other option,
- but you're not ready.<br/>- Tell me.
Well, if you have to seal the deal<br/>in just one date,
it's got to be one doozy of a date, right?
I'm not talking dinner and a movie.
I'm not talking mini-golf.
I'm talking 17 dates' worth of romance<br/>wrapped up into one incredible night.
I'm talking about a superdate.
- A superdate?<br/>- Mmm-hmm.
That sounds kind of lame.<br/>What if we call it a megadate?
If you want my help, it's a superdate.
- All right.<br/>- Leave it to me.
I'll plan the whole thing.
- You're gonna plan the whole thing?<br/>- Mmm-hmm.
- I bet it'll be all gooey and romantic, huh?<br/>- Gooey and romantic?
Gooey and romantic?
Barney.
(SINGING)
You don't have to take her to Paris or Peru
Uh, Ted, what are you doing?
You just have to make her understand
Ted, people are looking at us.
What she means to you
Oh, God, really?<br/>You're really gonna do this right now?
On your superdate
Troubles of the world<br/>will simply have to wait
For wonders and amazement<br/>served up on a silver plate
Hurry up now, don't be late
'Cause hand in hand<br/>You'll find a land
Where paradise awaits
And then, boom!
Fireworks over the Manhattan skyline,<br/>you kiss her...
And that's your superdate
- That sounds gooey and romantic.<br/>- Yeah.
- Strip club?<br/>- Strip club.
(BARNEY CLEARS THROAT)
OLDER TED: Finally,<br/>the night of the big dates arrived.
So, tonight's the big night.<br/>Where's the D-bag taking you?
That's not a good nickname for Don.<br/>I'll think of a better one.
You know, that, I just... I cancelled.
- What do you mean you... Wait... Hey...<br/>- Hey, what's wrong?
- Robin cancelled her date.<br/>- What?
She was totally psyched for it,<br/>like an hour ago.
Robin Scherbatsky,
you look like the classiest,<br/>most expensive prostitute ever.
Oh, thank you.
I take it you're excited to go out with Don?
You know what, I kind of am.<br/>Don't tell Marshall.
I won't.<br/>I bet you'll have a nice time tonight.
- Yeah.<br/>- Not, however, a super time.
A super time will be had by Barney<br/>on his date with Anita.
Yep. Carriage ride,<br/>dinner at Le Tombeur des Culottes.
They're calling it a superdate. So...
Ted! How could you do that?<br/>Robin just got over her mourning period.
- She seemed so happy after the breakup.<br/>- Oh, Ted. So unobservant.
Such a guy. She was obviously crushed.
Wait, but that would mean... Oh, no.
OLDER TED: And then I realized<br/>what a jackass I'd been to Robin.
I said a bang, bang, bangity bang
- Hey, what you singing?<br/>- Just a little ditty I wrote
about how many girls<br/>Barney's been banging lately.
- Well, count me in for a verse.<br/>- Great!
Bang, bang, bangity bang
- I said, a bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>- Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>I said a bang bang...
- No! Oh, God. Where is she?<br/>- I think she's in the restroom.
(CRYING)
ALL: Oh.
No, guys, guys, I'm fine.
(WHISTLING)
Hey.
Dude, why would you do that?
Because I'm angry at you! I'm angry at me!<br/>I'm angry at Ted!
And frankly, I'm still angry at the Empire.
Why are you angry at me?
Dude, you've been a real jerk<br/>in front of Robin
while she's been going<br/>through her mourning period.
Mourning period? She hasn't been<br/>going through any mourning period.
- So unobservant.<br/>- Such a guy.
Ugh, Barney, sit down.<br/>You need to hear some stuff.
- What, what? Is she upset or something?<br/>- Of course she's upset.
Take a look at yourself, you dumb slut.
OLDER TED: And then Aunt Lily told Barney<br/>every excruciating detail
of what he hadn't been seeing<br/>since the breakup.
You should've seen this girl.<br/>Bang, ping, pawdau, gu-dunk.
Okay, I'm leaving.
So, we get up to my place.
(SOBBING)
(CROWD CHEERING ON TV)
(SNIFFLING)
... bang, bangity bang,<br/>bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bangity bang
I said bang, bang, bangity bang,<br/>bang, bang, bang
(VOMITING)
I can't believe Robin's been so upset.
I can't believe you threw up<br/>in your Stormtrooper helmet.
Eh. I did something worse in it<br/>after The Phantom Menace premiere.
So she's been this way<br/>ever since we broke up?
Actually, she was doing much better
until you decided to go<br/>on this stupid superdate with Anita.
And now, she's off sulking<br/>God knows where.
I know where.
(SIGHS)
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, Barney. What's up?
(SNIFFLING) I thought you were going<br/>on some big date.
- Robin, I know you're upset.<br/>- What? No.
I have never been happier.<br/>And this Anita sounds lovely.
I am so glad that you two just randomly<br/>happened to find each other.
It just warms my freaking heart!
(EX CLAIMS)
(GUN CLICKING)
(GRUNTS)
(EXHALING)
- So, are you sure you're not upset?<br/>- Well, of course I'm upset, Barney!
Don't you see how constantly<br/>talking about your conquests
makes me feel like<br/>I'm just another number to you?
But you're not just another number to me.
You know, and now you're taking Anita,
who you barely know,<br/>on this amazing date,
when I never got treated that way.
It just...<br/>It just sucks, that's all. It just sucks.
(SIGHS)
Wow. I knew<br/>I was bad at being a boyfriend,
but I had no idea I'd be so much worse<br/>at being an ex-boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
What can I do to make it up to you?
Nothing, Barney.
You've already proven<br/>that I'm not important to you.
Oh, stop that. I'm serious.<br/>Ask me for anything.
Uh, okay, don't sleep with Anita.
- Done.<br/>- Barney,
of course you're gonna sleep with her.
Why else would you be taking her<br/>on this superdate?
She's not going on the superdate, Robin.<br/>You are.
OLDER TED: Your Uncle Barney<br/>finally gave Aunt Robin
the superdate she truly deserved.
With a guy she truly deserved.
Of course, there was still one loose end.
- Barney.<br/>- Oh, hey, Anita.
I totally meant to call you.
Well, I'm breaking all my rules<br/>coming down here,
but nobody stands me up like that,<br/>so, are we going out or what?
I'm sorry, I made a promise to a friend.
I have to say no.
Oh. Oh, I see.
(SCOFFING) You're trying the "no" thing<br/>on me. You really think that's gonna work?
'Cause it won't!
Okay, how about this, I'll cut you a deal.
Maybe you might
get lucky after the 12th date.
- No.<br/>- The 11th date.
- No.<br/>- Fifth date.
- No.<br/>- Tonight.
- No.<br/>- Tonight before dinner.
- No.<br/>- How about you? You interested?
- Yeah.<br/>- Come on, Barney!
I'm sorry, Anita. The answer is no.
Well, good! Because my answer is no, too!
Okay, here's my final offer.
Barney!
And that's my story.
Well, here's a $500 ticket<br/>for jumping in the river.
I hope it was worth it.
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)
I hope so, too.
It's not true.<br/>It's an old wives' tale.
- Oh, hey, Robin.<br/>- Hey.
- How'd the big date go?<br/>- Uh, pretty well.
- Pretty, pretty well.<br/>- Like, how pretty well?
Oh, guys, guys, come on. It was fine.
You know, it was nice.<br/>We had a good time.
Let's just... Let's just leave it at that, okay?
Although, one interesting thing<br/>did happen.
I said a bang, bang, bangity bang<br/>I said a bang, bang, bangity bang
A bang, bang, bang, bang<br/>bang, bangity bang
I said a bang, bang, bangity bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang<br/>bang, bang, bangity bang

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, your Aunt Lily<br/>has always been one of those people
who loves their birthday. Loves it.
(BEEPING)
It's my birthday!
So it's a good thing she married Marshall.
(BEEPING)
It's still my birthday!
Because he loves planning birthdays.
Feliz Cumpleanos, baby.
The theme of today's birthday<br/>breakfast in bed is Spanish Interlude.
(SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING)
Yay!
It's, uh...
How on Earth did we end up in<br/>the lyrical rolling hills of Northern Spain?
Yay!
Baby, tonight is gonna be so much fun.<br/>Just the five of us, black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up your favorite<br/>cognac pumpkin cheesecake from Edgar's.
Yay!
Okay. I am off to run<br/>your super secret birthday errand.
Yay!
And I'm taking this guy with me,
because I don't like the way<br/>he's looking at you.
Yay.
A new camera. Oh, thank you, Marshall!<br/>I love it!
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, a little bonus.<br/>I took some naked pictures of myself
before I wrapped it, put a bow on it.
- There wasn't a bow on it.<br/>- Wrong "it."
(LILY GASPS)
Thank you, honey. I'm gonna get some<br/>great shots of our little group with this.
(BOTH GROAN)
OLDER TED: Now, kids, you've seen<br/>your Aunt Lily's photo albums:
Leather bound, acid-free paper,<br/>adorable handwritten captions.
And most importantly, the group shot.
Cute photo, right, kids?
But what you don't see<br/>is what happened 10 seconds
before this picture was taken.
Okay, I wanna get the perfect group shot.<br/>Marshall, sit between Robin and Barney.
Why?
Oh, you know,<br/>light, color balance, aperture.
You're just saying camera words.
Wait. You don't want Barney and me<br/>to look like a couple in this picture,
- do you?<br/>- Of course I don't!
You two aren't gonna last.<br/>I'm going for timeless here.
- How dare you!<br/>- That is so rude!
- It's true.<br/>- Totally true.
We're running on fumes here.<br/>But still rude.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
OLDER TED: We hated Lily's group shots.
Okay, maybe I get a little bossy,<br/>but I just wanna remember those times.
Like tonight.<br/>I can't imagine a better birthday
than being here,<br/>with just my four best friends.
- Yay!<br/>- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
And Ted's here now. Yay!
Happy birthday! This is Amanda.
(SHAKILY) And Amanda. Yay.
Ted, you were supposed<br/>to bring a cheesecake,
but instead you brought two grocery bags<br/>and a woman we've never seen before.
Hi, I'm Marshall. Welcome to our home.<br/>Start talking.
Well, Amanda's gonna make Lily a cake.<br/>She's a chef.
We met when I was at a restaurant<br/>last week, and I sent some soup back.
Luckily she's got such pretty hair,<br/>I didn't mind eating a little bit of it.
They call me The Shedder at work.
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) I'm so glad<br/>you're making my birthday cake.
In honor of Lily's 32nd birthday,<br/>I've got a lot of great games planned,
- starting with Lilial Pursuit.<br/>- Ah, clever.
- Okay, who's got number one?<br/>- I do.
Of course you do. Okay, Amanda goes first.
Thirty-two seconds on the clock<br/>to answer as many questions as possible.
And, go!
- Question one, what is Lily's favorite color?<br/>- (TICKING)
Well, she's wearing pink,<br/>so I'm gonna say pink.
Yeah, that's Robin.
Oh. Uh...
- Her favorite color is elbow.<br/>- (MOUTHING) Yellow.
I believe Ted<br/>was mouthing the word "yellow."
Which also would've been wrong.
This game is called Gilding The Lily.
- Nice.<br/>- Thank you.
Okay, you've all written down your favorite<br/>things about the birthday girl,
and, Lily-pad, you guess who wrote what.
"Lily makes everyone in her life,<br/>from her friends to her students..."
(WHISPERING)<br/>Lily's a kindergarten teacher.
That's what he means by students.
"...feel loved. She makes the best<br/>oatmeal raisin cookies ever,
"can recite every line from Goonies..."
Lily saw Goonies in the theater<br/>right after her parents separated.
For a long time after that,<br/>she had real trouble trusting people.
Ted!
"...and she's the strongest person<br/>I've ever met.
"I can't imagine my life without her.<br/>I love you, Lily."
- Aw! Robin.<br/>- Of course it was me.
- Come on.<br/>- So sweet. Okay.
(ROBIN AND LILY EX CLAIMING)
Lily, you try to guess who wrote this.
(AMANDA GULPING)
"You seem really nice."
Oh.
- I'm gonna guess Amanda.<br/>- No, that was me.
And I meant every word.
Well, I should get back to that cake.
Okay, let me know if you need anything.
All right, quick, let's do the group photo.<br/>Everybody gather around the fireplace.
Wait, hang on. I'll let Amanda know.
Oh, no, that's okay.<br/>She's busy in the kitchen.
Let's not bother her. Come on.<br/>(CLICKS TONGUE)
Wait, hang on a second.
You don't want Amanda<br/>in the photo, do you?
No, no. It's just, you know,<br/>auto focus, shutter speed, zoom.
- Lily, what's going on?<br/>- Who wants a party hat?
Hey, look. Look, I'm a bird!
- Let's all be birds!<br/>- Lily! Tell me the truth!
No, of course not! I'm not gonna let<br/>another one of your dumb skanks
ruin my precious memories!
(CLICKS)
- Lily, what are you talking about?<br/>- Ted, you always do this.
You bring girls that we barely know<br/>to all our big group events.
- I do not!<br/>- Oh, really?
Oh. Well, let's just take a little walk<br/>down Random Skank Lane.
Or we could just keep on strolling down<br/>Best Birthday Ever Avenue.
Do I get a vote? Skank Lane. Skank Lane!
Hey, hey, guys,<br/>I've composed a song for the evening.
Follow along. The chorus goes like this.
(SINGING) Happy, Happy Lily Day<br/>Happy, Happy...
Christmas morning, four years ago.
Our first Christmas together,<br/>just the five of us.
Oh, Ted,<br/>here's another fun little trivia game.
It's called Name That Bitch.
It's... It is... Sa... San...
Wrong. You're thinking of Santa,<br/>'cause it was Christmas.
Fun fact, each year, my mother<br/>has Easter tea with her friend Bunny.
(CHUCKLING) Okay, not that fun.
Yeah, I remember her name. It's Sara.
Close. It's Lailanie.<br/>She just had to come to Christmas
because you said,<br/>"Guys, she might be the one."
And she's not the only "might be the one."
New Year's Eve, 2007.
Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall,<br/>and "she's the one" Emily.
Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral.
Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted,
and " this-just-proves-you-find-the-one-<br/>when-you're-not-looking" Isabelle.
My appendix surgery.<br/>Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and...
Well, this one you admitted,<br/>you were just trying to bang.
Respect.
Oh, hey, remember this yoga instructor<br/>you brought to my birthday last year?
ALL: (SINGING) You.
Thank you. Oh, my God.
You guys are not gonna believe<br/>who just came in.
Don't look, don't look!<br/>Why aren't you looking?
- It's Slash from Guns N' Roses.<br/>- ALL: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Okay, okay. Group shot. Group shot!<br/>Come on!
And we got it! We got a picture<br/>with Slash on my birthday.
Awesome, right? Right?
- We were there. We know how this ends.<br/>- Wrong!
ROBIN: You know what's funny<br/>about this picture?
- He was grabbing my ass.<br/>- LILY: Really? He was grabbing my ass, too.
He was grabbing my ass, too.<br/>How many hands does that guy have?
No wonder he's such a good guitarist.
Actually, sorry, dude.<br/>I thought that you were Lily.
Wait a second,<br/>look at these pictures again.
Barney has the same pose in each shot,<br/>and these are, like, years apart.
Ah, yes, about that.<br/>I never take a bad picture.
Never have. Never will.
(SCOFFS) Dude, there has to be<br/>a bad picture of you.
- Nope! Not one.<br/>- What about from elementary school?
- Everyone has bad pictures from school.<br/>- Not the Barnacle.
I always look drop-dead,<br/>stone-cold amazing.
Unlike Marshall, who just looks<br/>dead, stoned, and cold.
OLDER TED: He was right, kids.
Your Uncle Marshall<br/>does a lot of things well,
but he does not take a good picture.
They're not all bad, okay? Like, here.
Here, look at this one, my eyes are open.
- Marshall, no!<br/>- You did put a bow on it!
- Chip and dip, Barney?<br/>- Sure.
- A-ha!<br/>- (CLICKS)
Got it! A bad picture.
Is it, though?
No, wait. You were eating a chip!
- Where's the chip?<br/>- It is physically impossible
for me to take a bad picture.<br/>I don't know why. Ask God.
Look, Lily, I'm sorry about Amanda,<br/>but I'm just gonna say it.
You are being a birthday brat.
(GASPS)
You're all bent out of shape
just 'cause you think<br/>I ruined a couple of pictures?
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Ted, these girls<br/>have ruined so many events.
- Or are you forgetting Paris?<br/>- What happened in Paris?
It was junior year,<br/>and I was studying abroad in Paris,
- and hadn't seen Marshall for two months.<br/>- Two months!
And I had just started having sex.<br/>I wasn't ready to stop for two months.
And Marshall was coming to visit<br/>over spring break.
And at the last minute,<br/>Ted decided to come
with the girl he had just<br/>gotten back together with, Karen.
Karen.
- I am so excited you're here.<br/>- I'm so excited to go to Paris.
I'm so excited to have sex again.
LILY: But just before the plane took off...
- Wait, I wanna tell you something.<br/>- Really?
'Cause I think I wanna<br/>tell you the same thing.
Is your thing, " I had sex with<br/>my philosophy professor last night"?
'Cause that's my thing.
LILY: And thus began the longest<br/>seven-and-a-half hours of Marshall's life.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)
(INAUDIBLE)
When I picked them up at the airport...
Ted broke up with me.<br/>I need to sleep in your room this week.
Marshall can bunk with Ted.
(INAUDIBLE)
Two months!<br/>My balls were bleues! Bleues!
This will come as no shock,<br/>but the rest of the trip was terrible.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)
And all I wanted was a romantic kiss<br/>picture in front of the Eiffel Tower,
which I actually did get.
It just happened to be<br/>between Karen and Fran?ois,
our waiter from the day before.
Wow, that's just awful. Just, just, just...
(CLATTERS)
Oh, whoopsie, hey, I dropped my phone.<br/>You mind picking it up for me?
- Oh, sure.<br/>- Smile, you son-of-a-bitch!
- Got it!<br/>- Did you, though?
What? How do you do that?<br/>You weren't even standing up.
The camera loves me, Robin.
More than loves me.<br/>The camera lusts after me.
The camera wants to put on<br/>some nice lingerie, pop in an Al Green CD,
dim the lights, and do all the work,<br/>while I just lie there with my eyes closed.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Look, I'm sorry about Paris,<br/>and all the ruined group shots.
But when you're single, you gotta hope<br/>that each next new girl is the one.
- I mean, Erin.<br/>- Emily.
- Irene.<br/>- Isabelle.
- And Sara.<br/>- It's Lailanie. What is wrong with you?
At the time, yes. I thought each<br/>of these girls could be the one.
But I gotta stay hopeful.<br/>I mean, what's the alternative?
Here's the alternative. How about<br/>no more random skanks at my birthday?
Hey, sweetie.
- Uh, do you guys have a cooling rack?<br/>- Oh, drawer under the oven.
Can't wait. You're just the best.
And, Ted, I'm sorry. I'm gonna<br/>have to agree with Lily on this.
I mean, these kind of events<br/>are hard for a new person.
That's why I didn't bring Don tonight.<br/>I mean, when I lived in Japan,
this guy, for our third date,<br/>brought me to his brother's wedding.
Now I, a total stranger,
am in that Japanese couple's<br/>wedding picture for all eternity.
(CLICKS)
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
Yeah, Ted,<br/>I think you should listen to Robin.
Right. Right.<br/>'Cause Robin's your best friend.
- Exactly.<br/>- Your best friend in the whole world.
- Absolutely.<br/>- (WHISPERING) Careful, Lily. It's a trap.
TED: And before she was your best friend,<br/>what was she?
Oh, that's right, one of my random skanks.
- Hey!<br/>- Okay, yes, Ted.
- This particular skank...<br/>- Hey!
...happened to work out.<br/>But she's the skanky exception,
- not the skanky rule.<br/>- Hey, I'm crying a little bit.
Okay. Hey, guys, that about wraps up<br/>this whole skank conversation.
Let's get back to the birthday song.
Okay, Barney, your part goes like this.
(SINGING) She's cute
She's cute
She's cute
Lily, I bring girls to these events<br/>because you guys are important to me.
- You're my family.<br/>- And, hey, Robin. Hey, Robin.
Robin. Your part goes like this.
(SINGING IN FALSETTO) And nice
And nice
And oh, so nice
Yes, we're a family.
So, why can't these events<br/>ever just be us?
Like the time we celebrated<br/>Marshall passing the bar exam.
Hey, guys. This is the disgusting,<br/>smelly hippie I'm dating.
ALL: Hey.
- I did not say that.<br/>- Well, you might as well have.
Hey, guys. This is Strawberry.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- Um, should we order some more food?<br/>- Oh, no, Strawberry's not eating.
- I'm a vegetarian.<br/>- Okay.
Well, let's all raise a glass.
For the last three years,<br/>Marshall has been working so hard,
- and I am so proud of you.<br/>- Meat is murder!
(SCREAMING) Meat is murder!
Okay, I admit it.<br/>Strawberry was a mistake.
But how could I have known that going in?
ALL: Her name was Strawberry!
Look, if it's such a big deal,
Amanda doesn't have to be<br/>in the group photo.
But I promise,<br/>she's not gonna ruin your birthday.
- Just give her a chance.<br/>- See, look, guys,
we're all friends again!<br/>Now let's work on those harmonies.
(SINGING) Happy, Happy Lily Day
Happy, Happy Lily Day
All done! I hope you like it.
"Happy 42nd birthday, Lori."
OLDER TED: Kids, you know how I've told<br/>you about Lily's you're-dead-to-me look?
That expression she gets just<br/>before she explodes in white-hot rage?
Well, this wasn't it.
(CHUCKLES)
But this was Marshall's.
Forty-second?<br/>Does this hot piece of ass look 42 to you?
Or does she look like her name is Lori?
- Oh, Marshall, it's okay.<br/>- No, Lily, it's not okay!
- Ted, get this stranger out of my house.<br/>- I am so sorry.
Out!
(DOOR CLOSES)
(SINGING) Happy, Happy Lily Day<br/>Happy, Happy Lily Day
Well, Amanda refused to come back.<br/>She thinks you guys hate her.
Marshall, you have to go apologize.
You ruined Lily's birthday,<br/>and you want me to apologize.
If anything, you should apologize to me.
What are you talking about?
Ted, you bring girls<br/>to these intimate events,
and it makes them think<br/>that things are really serious.
And then, when you break up with them,<br/>you know who they turn to? Me.
I've been your girlfriend clean-up crew<br/>for years.
February, 2005. I had just come back<br/>from a marathon study session
at the law library.
Hey, hey, Natalie. Where's Ted?
We broke up. Again.
Uh-oh.
Won't you sit with me for a little while?<br/>Just sit.
Oh, man. You know what?<br/>I've been up for, like, 36 hours.
(SOBBING INCOHERENTLY) Yeah,<br/>but I don't have anyone else to talk to.
- Just for a few minutes.<br/>- Thanks.
(MARSHALL SIGHS)
(WEEPING)
And, at first,<br/>I was completely sympathetic.
But, damn it, Ted, over the years,<br/>you've made me cynical.
You know what?<br/>I'm gonna go get us some Rocky Road,
and we're just gonna sit here<br/>and talk it out until it makes sense.
I just thought we had something<br/>so special, you know?
Me, too. Yeah, but, you know,<br/>life goes on, sweetheart.
I don't know how I'm gonna put<br/>my life back together after this.
Oh, shut up.
Well, I'm sorry my search for true love has<br/>been such an inconvenience to you guys.
You know what?<br/>Maybe your precious pictures
would look a lot better if I wasn't in them.
They'd look a lot better<br/>if Marshall weren't in them.
Cheap shot, cheap shot.
You know what these pictures are, Lily?
They're a big, fat lie. They're posed.<br/>They're touched up.
They're what you want our life to be,<br/>not what it is.
- That's not true.<br/>- Oh, yeah?
Okay. Look at this one.<br/>Halloween, two years ago.
You and Marshall got in a huge fight
because you didn't wanna<br/>dress up as penguins.
No, no, no.<br/>It's not just that she didn't want to.
It's that she called<br/>penguins lame. Penguins.
And yet, here you are,<br/>smiling like nothing's wrong.
Completely phony.
Oh! Robin's birthday, three years ago.<br/>Robin had a cold,
and you made her change<br/>out of her pajamas for the picture.
And then you pinched my cheeks<br/>really hard to get some color in them.
Yeah, but you looked pretty.
And then we all ate chocolate cake<br/>in my bed.
- Actually, that was a really nice night.<br/>- Yeah, it was.
- Yeah, I guess it was.<br/>- Hey, look at this one.
This is the first picture the three of us<br/>ever took together.
That's right. It was.
Hey, you remember how it happened?
- Okay, ready?<br/>- Wait, wait, wait.
What pose should we do?<br/>Buddy cop picture?
Oh, no, no. What about an '80s sitcom<br/>about two roommates
- who never agree on anything?<br/>- Mmm-hmm.
Nice. Okay, one, two...
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hi, Marshall. Ready for the movie?
Um, yeah. Just a second, though, okay?<br/>We're about to make history.
We're about to take<br/>our first ever roommate picture.
Yeah. Hey, why don't you get<br/>in the picture, too?
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
Wait. What are you doing, Ted?<br/>What if we break up?
What if you don't?
- Come on.<br/>- Come on.
(CLICKS)
I forgot all about that.
Marshall and I had just<br/>been dating a few weeks,
and you invited me into the picture.
Well, I liked you.
- We have to get Amanda back.<br/>- Really?
Ted, you believed in me.<br/>It's my turn to believe in you.
For all I know, she's the one.
Thanks, Lil.
I think Lori's age has made her very wise.
They say your 40s are<br/>when you really get to know yourself.
Mmm.
OLDER TED: So, your Aunt Lily<br/>called Amanda.
All right, people, gather around.<br/>Let's make a memory.
- Okay.<br/>- Okay, Marshall. No, Marshall, try this.
Keep your eyes closed<br/>until the last second,
- and when I say so, open them. Okay?<br/>- Okay, Ted.
Hey, Barney, is that a hole<br/>in your suit jacket?
What? Where?
Now, Marshall.
(CLICKS)
ROBIN: Damn it!
Ted, name that bitch.
- Bertha... Bertha?<br/>- No. It was my birthday.
Your brain makes associations<br/>in a very obvious way.
All right, people, gather around.<br/>Let's make a memory.
Hey, Robin,<br/>what's in this dip that you made?
It tastes like cilantro,
and you know that cilantro makes me...
- (SNEEZING)<br/>- (CLICKS)
ROBIN: Yes!

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, you may be wondering<br/>how many of these stories
I'm telling you are true. It's a fair question.
After all, there's a fine line between<br/>a good story and a bald-faced lie.
I never met anyone who could work<br/>that line better than your Uncle Barney.
Heck, he could jump rope with it.
I love to travel myself.
- Really?<br/>- Hmm.
- Where's the best place you've visited?<br/>- Hawaii's nice.
A buddy of mine lives in Seattle,<br/>that's a good spot.
But the best place,<br/>I'd have to say the moon.
Hi, Neil Armstrong.
No! You did not convince a girl
you were the first man<br/>to walk on the moon!
That happened seven years<br/>before you were born.
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.
Oh, yeah,<br/>our spaceship passed through a wormhole
or some gamma rays or something.<br/>I started aging backwards, blah, blah, blah.
So, you work in a yogurt shop,<br/>that must be wild.
(ALL GROANING)
Although, I did actually<br/>work in a yogurt store in high school.
And it was indeed wild.
Anywho, 20 minutes later,<br/>the eagle landed.
We knocked space boots.
Houston, we have a moaner.
Other space related double entendres.
Why do you feel the need<br/>to lie all the time?
I'm not lying! Guys, we made sweet love.
I got pictures.
No.
(SIGHING)
I hate my job.
What are you talking about?<br/>I thought you just interviewed the mayor.
Mayor McWoof. He wears a dog costume,<br/>and teaches kids not to litter.
At least he's supposed to.
I don't want to talk about Mayor McWoof.
I want to talk about these amazing insoles<br/>from Bon Appe-Feet!
Just look how shock absorbent they are!
A prop! The table's a prop!
(SIGHING) We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
Oh! Sorry, Robin. Got bored.
Yeah, I don't blame you.
Man, just one decent interview<br/>would be so nice for a change.
Fine. I'll look at my schedule,<br/>see when I'm available.
But I want a list of questions<br/>ahead of time,
and my personal life is off limits.
Ted, you caught seven peanuts in a row.<br/>It's impressive but it's not newsworthy.
- You caught seven in a row?<br/>- Seven in a row.
- Whoa!<br/>- But that's not what I'm talking about.
No, I'm talking about how I was selected
to build a scale model<br/>of the Empire State Building,
for the largest re-creation<br/>of the New York skyline in the world.
Is that the thing you were playing with<br/>the other night?
I wasn't playing. I was working.
"It's you." "It's me."
"I saw you in the street."
"Are you Annie?"
"Yes."
Ted?
Are you acting out<br/>the last scene of Sleepless in Seattle
with little dolls?
How long have you been out here?
- Ten seconds.<br/>- Yeah. Just the last scene.
Oh, Ted. Again?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Ooh! That's the pizza.<br/>Baby, do you have any cash?
Oh!
You know, I don't... I actually...<br/>I don't think that I should have to pay,
'cause I'm not a fan of pizza.
(LILY GASPING)
- What?<br/>- Marshall, we've driven halfway
across the country for a piece of pizza,<br/>literally, hundreds of times.
I once caught you eating pizza<br/>in the shower.
Marshall, there's a cartoon of you<br/>on our coupons.
I'm not saying<br/>Marshall's a guy who likes pizza,
but last time<br/>he went in for a physical, doctor says,
"Marshall, you got to stop eating pizza."<br/>Marshall says, "Why?"
Doc says, "So I can examine you."<br/>But seriously, we kid because we love.
All right, look, the reason<br/>that I don't have any money on me
is because
I got mugged.
You what?
Can somebody please pay Arthur, all right?<br/>I'm starving.
- How's your dad, by the way?<br/>- Better.
Good.
- Oh, my God! You got mugged?<br/>- Who mugged you?
Was he wearing a black skull-knit cap<br/>and a five o'clock shadow?
- Did he say, "Stick them up"?<br/>- Yes, Barney,
because I got mugged in 1947,<br/>at the corner of Abbott and Costello.
No. I was cutting through Central Park<br/>on my way home from work.
Watch it. Don't get any closer.
It's cool. It's cool.
It was completely terrifying.
"It was completely terrifying."
- What are you doing?<br/>- I'm rehearsing.
I'm gonna pretend this happened to me<br/>later to try and get some sympathy sex.
Barney, that won't work.
- Will it?<br/>- Big time.
I'll allow it.
I can't believe someone pointed a gun<br/>at my Marshmallow!
I'm shaking! I don't think<br/>I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight.
Aw! Here, sweetie.<br/>I have something that will help you sleep.
(ALL GASPING)
Just stick this under your pillow.<br/>You'll sleep like a freaking baby.
- Robin, put that away!<br/>- It's not gonna hurt anyone.
- (GUN CLICKS)<br/>- The safety's on.
Okay, you know what, let's all just relax.
We don't need a gun.
I'd just like to forget this ever happened<br/>and try to move on with my life.
"I'd just like to forget this ever happened,<br/>and try to move on with my life."
This is great stuff.<br/>I think I'm going to add tears, though.
Listen, baby, I know that it's scary,<br/>but look at me.
I'm fine, okay?<br/>Can't we just put this behind us?
That's gold. But I'm gonna switch it to<br/>"putting me behind you."
Baby, you don't have to worry about me.
I mean, yes, I'm a little scared.
But I'm a New Yorker,<br/>I'm not gonna let this change me.
I've changed! I'm a gun person now.
- Clip!<br/>- Yeah, maybe we should
- just take a break for a little bit.<br/>- (IN HUSKY VOICE) I said, "Clip!"
- You want to get a gun?<br/>- Not a scary one.
Just a cute, little pink Beretta
that matches these adorable<br/>strappy sandals I just bought.
By the way, our new credit card works.
You don't need a gun.
Every statistic in the world<br/>points to the fact that
it's safer not to have a gun in the home<br/>than to have one.
Especially in our home.
You know how I'm always<br/>accidentally injuring you.
Pretty easy, right?
(LILY SCREAMING)
(LILY SCREAMING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Hurry up, baby. The party's about to start.
- Boo!<br/>- (SCREAMS)
Oh, my God, Lily!<br/>I thought you were going as a sexy cat!
I changed my mind.
And now you want to bring a gun<br/>into that equation?
I know, you're right,
but every time I close my eyes,<br/>I picture that guy pointing a gun at you.
(CRYING) And you're my whole world,<br/>Marshall.
If something ever happened to you,<br/>I would just... I would just...
Okay, okay. I know. I know. I know.
Okay, look, I got to admit something.
That mugging didn't happen<br/>exactly the way that I said it did.
Aha! So he was wearing<br/>a black skull-knit cap!
Told you!
No, he wasn't wearing<br/>a black skull-knit cap.
He wasn't wearing anything.
Wait. So...
Watch it. Don't get any closer.
It's... It's cool. It's cool.
He naked-muggered you?
I'm not gonna ask<br/>where he was keeping the gun.
Are we sure it was a gun?
No, guys. I was walking home from work,
through Central Park,<br/>and I stopped at the zoo.
Watch it. Don't get any closer.
Oh! It's cool. It's cool.
(MONKEY CHATTERING)
You're telling us...
That you got mugged...
By a monkey.
I got mugged by a monkey.
(ALL LAUGHING)
- You got mugged by a monkey?<br/>- Yep. I got mugged by a monkey.
I was embarrassed,<br/>so I made up the other story.
But the point is, Lily, you don't need a gun.
(LAUGHING) Forget about the gun.<br/>We're on this now.
Wow, monkeys are mugging people now?<br/>It really is a jungle out there.
(GASPING) Oh, my God. That monkey<br/>has our address. What if he's in a gang?
I hope he doesn't do a swing by.
Why didn't you just ask the zookeeper<br/>to get your wallet back?
'Cause I saw what the monkey<br/>was doing with it,
and I didn't really want it after that.
Hey, guys. What's up?
Oh! Some new information<br/>has come to light on Marshall's mugging.
- Oh, really? Did they catch the guy?<br/>- Well, he's behind bars.
Well, where did they find him?
I'm guessing naked in a tree,<br/>throwing his own feces.
Oh. I've seen that guy.<br/>See, that's why I take cabs.
You know how they caught him, right?
- There was a tail on him.<br/>- There was a tail on him!
- Okay, what is going on?<br/>- All right, Robin, here's what happened.
No, no, no, no, no. Let me tell it.<br/>It's my story.
You see, young Marshall was at the zoo,<br/>eating a banana.
No, I wasn't eating a banana.<br/>If you're gonna tell it, tell it right.
You're right.<br/>The banana was on the ground.
There was no banana. There was no...<br/>There was no banana.
Marshall, I apologize. Truly.
Robin, here's what happened.
(MONKEY CHATTERING)
Oh, God. Oh, God, don't shoot.
There was no banana!
Come on, Barney. I know Marshall<br/>didn't get mugged by a monkey.
Marshall?
- That part he got right.<br/>- What?
Guys, this is not<br/>an uncommon thing, okay?
In Thailand, in China, in Costa Rica, people<br/>get mugged by monkeys all the time.
Monkeys are gatherers.<br/>Because of their inter-social dynamics,
having a predisposition towards stealing<br/>gives one a genetic advantage.
You were mugged by a monkey.
Maybe he was just curious.<br/>Were you wearing a yellow hat?
Marshall, in all seriousness,<br/>this is a great story.
I mean, can I interview you about it<br/>on my show?
What? He gets to be on your show?<br/>What about my model?
No one wants to see a guy<br/>come on my show and play with dolls.
Okay, first of all, that is not what it is.
And second of all, you just had a guy<br/>on your show playing with dolls.
So, your dolls are favored to win at the<br/>Rhinebeck Collector Awards next month.
Only if they behave themselves.
Last year, I found one of them<br/>cavorting with a G.I. Joe.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
It's not funny.
What were you thinking?<br/>What if you'd gotten pregnant?
And you invited him back<br/>for a follow-up interview!
Only because the FBI asked us to keep him<br/>occupied while they searched his house.
Come on, Marshall, I need the story.<br/>It's got everything.
Crime, monkeys, no stupid model<br/>of the Empire State Building
that takes up my entire living room<br/>and makes the whole place smell like glue.
Come on. Do this for me, as a friend.
- It'd be fun to see you on TV.<br/>- Yeah.
Okay, can you promise<br/>to present it in a way
that doesn't make a joke out of the fact<br/>that I got mugged by a monkey?
You got mugged by a monkey.
Oh, my God! I just got mugged!
- What?<br/>- Is what I was saying
to this girl at the bar earlier.
It was completely terrifying.
I just want to forget this ever happened<br/>and try to move on with my life.
Oh, you poor thing.
Neil?
- Neil?<br/>- I...
- Neil?<br/>- I...
- Neil!<br/>- Lady, my name's not Neil.
It's Ba... (GAGGING)
- Why are you calling him Neil?<br/>- Because that's his name.
He's Neil Armstrong.
The cyclist?
I thought you were supposed to be<br/>on a shuttle mission.
I thought you just got mugged.
Okay, I can do this. You see,
I was on my way to the launch pad<br/>when I was mugged.
And the mugger<br/>took my space shuttle keys.
Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way?
- I am!<br/>- Me, too!
(BARNEY CHUCKLING)
And it was the best three-way ever.
Strange, 'cause you look like you just<br/>had two vodka tonics thrown in your face.
You have lime in your hair.
The story's better with my ending...<br/>Just... Okay?
So, there we are, zero gravity.
The three of us<br/>wearing nothing but space helmets.
- ROBIN: Marshall.<br/>- And I...
You won't believe it. I pitched<br/>the monkey mugger story to my producer,
and he loves it!
Oh! Wow.
- Yeah. Yeah.<br/>- Really? Cool.
I mean, who's ever heard of a guy<br/>getting mugged by a monkey?
No one, except for the good people<br/>of Thailand, China, Costa Rica,
and plenty of other countries
where monkey crime is<br/>an extremely common nuisance.
Well, the best part is, he said that<br/>it might get picked up to go national.
Guys, this monkey mugger story<br/>could make me famous.
Me, too.
(STAMMERING) Guys, this is bad.<br/>I can't do this.
- So it'll be a little embarrassing. So what?<br/>- It's not that.
Guys,
(WHISPERING) I wasn't mugged<br/>by a monkey.
- So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?<br/>- No, I wasn't.
So, what you're saying is,
the monkey tricked you<br/>into giving him your wallet?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
- So, you mugged the monkey?<br/>- Guys, there was no monkey!
It was a human being with a gun.
Are you sure it wasn't one monkey<br/>standing on another monkey's shoulders
wearing a men's trench coat?
- Be about the right height.<br/>- No! I...
I just made that story up<br/>so that Lily wouldn't get a gun.
The truth is that it never happened.
I don't buy it!
- What?<br/>- You heard me.
I think you were mugged by a monkey.<br/>You just don't want to go on Robin's show,
'cause you're afraid<br/>it'll make you look like a big joke.
- Well, won't it?<br/>- The biggest 'cause it's so funny.
Well, it never happened, okay?
And I can lie to you guys about it,<br/>because you're my best friends.
- I am, but go on.<br/>- But I can't lie about it on national TV.
Ted, you've known him the longest.<br/>Is he telling the truth?
Ted, don't.
I can't tell.
He smells good.
I just can't tell.
Well, I'm still saying it happened.
Maybe. But, Marshall,<br/>if you didn't get mugged by a monkey,
you can't let Robin report it on her show.<br/>I mean, this could hurt her credibility.
Oh, please. Journalists lie all the time.
I'm sorry, but I will believe that<br/>Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.
Okay, this may come as a shock to you,<br/>Barney, but people don't like to be lied to.
Wrong. They don't like finding out<br/>they've been lied to.
"Because a lie is just a great story
"that someone ruined with the truth."<br/>Barney Stinson.
Case in point,<br/>what that girl Sarah did to me.
- You mean what you did to her.<br/>- No. I mean what she did to me.
The truth is, I'm afraid the three-way story<br/>didn't go exactly as I said it did.
Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way?
Lisa, wait.
- Yes, Neil?<br/>- You're Lisa? Sarah, wait.
Look,
I'm not Neil Armstrong.
I'm sorry I lied.
Well, I guess I wasn't<br/>completely honest with you either.
I mean, I said that I was 28,<br/>but the truth is that I'm really 31.
And if we're being completely honest,
I went to the doctor the other day<br/>and found out...
Thirty-one! I was happy, very happy,
thinking that I had nailed a 28-year-old<br/>with some sun damage.
People want the lie, Marshall.<br/>They need the lie,
which is why, as far as I'm concerned,<br/>you were mugged by a monkey.
Just as sure as I had that three-way.<br/>I am the greatest in the world!
(BARNEY CHUCKLING)
Barney, is that the three-way belt?
- You know it.<br/>- Props!
Man, I slept so great last night.
(SIGHS) Can you believe<br/>I almost bought a gun?
I'm so glad you got mugged by a monkey.
Okay, you guys got me.
I was just nervous.<br/>I got mugged by a monkey.
- Yes! I knew it!<br/>- Wait a minute.
Now I'm thinking<br/>you really weren't mugged by a monkey.
Come on, Ted. Why would<br/>he make something like that up?
Yeah, come on, Ted.
Come here.
Okay, seriously, what is that cologne?<br/>It's intoxicating.
OLDER TED: So, late the following night,<br/>we all went to the set of Robin's show.
Okay, Marshall, now, don't be nervous.
What we're going to do is,<br/>we're going to sit you...
- What the hell is this?<br/>- I don't know.
Looks like something covered by a sheet.
Guess if you want to find out,<br/>you're gonna have to do a story on it.
You're gonna be covered by a sheet
if you don't<br/>get your stupid model out of here.
Dude, what are you doing?
I don't think Marshall's going to lie on TV.
And when he backs out, I want to be there<br/>for my friend Robin with a story.
Or rather, 102 stories,
because that's how tall<br/>a certain iconic New York landmark is.
Now, I want to buy a gun.
Whoa, the monkey's here.
Surprise. We thought it would<br/>help the story to bring him here
so you could face your attacker.
Yeah, because of this incident,
we will be sending Captain Bobo<br/>to a wildlife sanctuary.
Ooh! I bet he'll like it there.
No, ma'am. You see, we'll be<br/>splitting him up from his mate Milly.
They've been together for a long time.
His mate's name is Milly?
OLDER TED: And then the interview began.
Marshall, in your own words,<br/>describe what happened.
Well, I would... I... I would love to<br/>tell you what happened, Robin.
But...
I'm just... I'm so curious as to<br/>what is going on underneath that sheet.
Well, we're not here to talk about that.<br/>We're here to talk about your mugging.
Right. Well, people get mugged<br/>in New York City all the time, Robin.
But how often do you get to see<br/>whatever's under that sheet?
- Mike, can we get a shot of that?<br/>- We'll be right back.
- We're clear.<br/>- What the hell are you doing?
Okay, Robin, I wasn't really mugged<br/>by a monkey, okay?
I just made up that story<br/>so that Lily wouldn't buy a gun.
- So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?<br/>- No, what are you talking about, baby?
Of course I was mugged by a monkey.
Great. Tell it to America.<br/>We're back in five.
No. No. No. Not back in five.<br/>I wasn't mugged by a monkey.
- Okay, that's it. I'm getting a gun.<br/>- No, no. Don't get a gun.
- I was mugged by a monkey.<br/>- Well, then, Bobo here is going away.
Wasn't. I wasn't mugged by a monkey.
Ted, do you have any idea<br/>if Marshall was mugged by a monkey?
- None whatsoever.<br/>- Just tell me,
were you or were you not mugged<br/>by Captain Bobo?
Yeah, baby,<br/>just tell us what really happened.
Yeah, Marshall, just tell us the truth.
Come on, you promised.
(ALL CLAMORING)
OLDER TED: And that's when<br/>Marshall realized
there was only one thing he could say.
All right.
Here's the truth.
I...
am going back to bed.
OLDER TED: And that was it.
We never found out what really happened<br/>to Uncle Marshall's wallet.
But we do know this.<br/>Aunt Lily never got a gun.
Aunt Robin's credibility<br/>remained unimpeached.
And Bobo and Milly lived out their days<br/>together in the Central Park Zoo.
(SIGHING) Damn it.
All right, Ted, mike up.
Miked up and made up.<br/>Red leather, yellow leather.
That wasn't very satisfying.
When I tell everyone at work this story,<br/>I'm saying he was mugged by a monkey.
And I'm gonna keep the banana-on-a-string<br/>thing. That was working.
Barney, enough with the lies.
You can't just tack on a new ending
because you're not satisfied<br/>with how a story wraps up.
Oh, really?
Well, mark my words, Mosby.
Someday, you'll be telling this story,<br/>and you'll see it my way.
Doubtful.
OLDER TED: And then, kids,<br/>you'll never believe what happened.
The monkey got loose.
He's got one of my dolls!
ZOOKEEPER: Bobo, come here, Bobo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's climbing the building.
- Bobo, come here.<br/>- I'll get him.
Is this really happening?
Sure is, Ted.
OLDER TED: True story.
ENGLISH - US - SDH
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids,<br/>everyone has one or two moments
when they make a huge, crazy decision<br/>that changes their lives forever.
This is the story of mine.
It all started with a visit from my mom<br/>and her long-time boyfriend, Clint,
who was always saying stuff like...
Ted, your mother<br/>is a very, very erotic woman.
Please don't.
As a painter /songwriter /<br/>volunteer fear fighter,
I find her incredibly sexual.
But you have your own sexual memories<br/>with your mom, don't you?
Please don't.
Exiting her womb. Receiving her milk.<br/>You get me?
Good.
I cannot believe I am with that man.
Mom, Mom, it's okay.
You don't have to settle.<br/>There are plenty of guys...
He's so cool. And he picked me.
Well, I'm glad you're both so happy.
Well, good.<br/>Because we do have an announcement.
Son.
Sync by vNaru
Yes, my mom was lapping me.
Getting married for a second time,<br/>before I was even married once.
I was so happy for them,<br/>so freaking happy.
Still, weddings can be magical.
For all I knew, I'd end up sharing a dance<br/>with my own future wife there.
And if you don't boil those jam jars,<br/>it's just a welcome mat for bacteria.
That wasn't her.
- Oh, congratulations.<br/>- We are so happy for you.
I feel like I'm 19 again.
It's like the last 35 years of my life<br/>never happened.
So wonderful to hear, Mom.
Son, to show that your mom and I<br/>will always be there for you,
I want you to have this beautiful picture,<br/>that I painted.
Kids, there was no guitar.
Excuse me, Ted.
- Best...<br/>- Wedding...
Ever.
Hello, everyone.<br/>Mahalo for being here with us.
My entire life,
well, this life,
this is your song.
When I squeeze<br/>her trembling bosom
Oh, God.
The blood pumps to my loins
When I penetrate her...
Kids, I swear to God,<br/>I blacked out for the next 12 minutes.
So I have no idea<br/>how the song got to this ending.
And Mahatma Gandhi<br/>And the pancakes
- Everyone. And the dragon<br/>And the dragon
And you, Virginia
Guys, guys. Guess what Robin just did?
And true.
Are you crying?
I know it's stupid, but...
- Everyone. And the dragon<br/>- And the dragon
And you...
I'm happy, you know.
Not as happy as I am, Robin.
Guys, guys. Guess what Robin just did?
And then, I told you guys<br/>what Robin just did,
but you were there for that.<br/>I got to tell the rest of the wedding.
Aunt Meredith.
Kids, I can't overstate<br/>how horrible it is to be the single guy
at your own mother's second wedding.
So, Ted, when's your wedding?
So, Ted, when's your wedding?
- When's your wedding?<br/>- When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?
Robin cried at Clint's song.
Oh, I told you already.
Ted's hot sister Heather.
I have to leave.
Wait, Ted, what about your toast?
Make up some emergency or something.<br/>I just... I can't handle this.
Ted, Ted, where you going?<br/>It's your mother's wedding.
Uncle Larry, my hand to God,<br/>Niagara Falls.
And my friends didn't see me<br/>for the next 72 hours.
Seriously, is Ted okay?<br/>I mean, I know it was a rough weekend,
but this radio silence is weird.
I know. His mom's called like five times<br/>asking where he disappeared to.
Sorry, Robin, they're all out of pretzels.<br/>And I know how emotional you get...
Let it go. Let it go.
Okay. Okay.
- I cried at Clint's song.<br/>- She cried at Clint's song.
Hi, guys.
- Ted, where have you been?<br/>- Are you okay?
Oh, I'm better than okay.<br/>I am on top of the world.
Come on. We're going for a ride.
Hey, buddy, do you want to,<br/>maybe, let somebody
who isn't having some sort of<br/>manic episode drive for a while?
Yeah. And where the hell are we going?
First, let me tell you what happened<br/>the night of the wedding.
Watching my mom get married,
I realized how far behind I was<br/>in my own life.
I just had to get out of there.<br/>So I went back to my hotel room,
and got onto this Web site<br/>I sometimes visit when I can't sleep.
No, no, no, no.
We do not want to know what you<br/>and the Internet do when you're lonely.
I didn't. I...
That's not the part of the night<br/>I was talking about.
I went to my favorite<br/>real estate auction site.
Come on, we've all got one.<br/>Scrolled through a few properties and...
Guys, I just bought my dream house.
What do you mean you bought this house?
I mean, I made a bid online,
I won the auction the next day,<br/>and I got approval.
I just finalized the paperwork.
And was the Blair Witch easy to deal with,<br/>or did she haggle over the closing costs?
Don't even joke about that, man.
So, I'm thinking this room<br/>will be the study.
You know, a place just for Dad.
I mean, the kids are welcome in here,<br/>if they're reading a book, but no toys.
It's not a question of withholding love.<br/>It's a question of drawing boundaries.
- Whoa.<br/>- Ted, this is insane.
This is gonna take years,<br/>and a small fortune to make livable.
I'm an architect. I'll find a way.<br/>And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time<br/>the old wifey and I are ready to move in.
Is she in the room with us right now, Ted?
Okay, okay. I know.<br/>I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet.
But I will, knock on wood.
- Careful, buddy.<br/>- Okay. Ted.
You can't just skip ahead to<br/>where you think your life should be.
It doesn't work that way.
Yeah, I got to agree. This may be<br/>the stupidest thing you've ever done.
Stupidest thing any of us have ever done.
- Okay, all right. Let's lay off Ted.<br/>- Thank you.
All right. We've all done<br/>some stupid things in our lives.
For example, I remember a time
when I dropped some bottle rockets<br/>in the toilet,
and I tried to dry them off<br/>in the microwave.
You must've been drunk off your ass.
No. Too stupid to be an adult.
He was obviously a kid<br/>when that happened.
A kid? How does a kid even get...
Who puts a bottle rocket<br/>in a microwave?
Oh, my God. Guys, great new game.
"Drunk or Kid?" Which one was I?<br/>Lock in your guesses.
- Drunk.<br/>- Kid.
Drum roll, please.
I was...
Drunk.
- Yeah.<br/>- Hey.
You know, I'm glad Robin got it right.
'Cause she's<br/>very sensitive and fragile.
I'm referencing the time<br/>she cried at Clint's song.
And even though I'm whispering,<br/>I actually hope she hears me.
It wasn't me.
What?
I'm not the one who cried at Clint's song.
And true.
Are you crying?
I know it's stupid, but...
- Everyone. And the dragon<br/>- And the dragon
They're just so happy, you know.
Not as happy as I am.
I will give you $500 if this<br/>just happened to you instead of me.
500 bucks? Deal.
Thank you, Robin.
You just saved me unspeakable<br/>public humiliation and shame.
Hmm.
Guys, guys. Guess what Robin just did?
Wait, you guys are...
Hi, I'm here for the inspection.
Oh! Great.<br/>I was worried you weren't coming.
Well, I was actually here<br/>a few minutes ago,
- but I guess the doorbell doesn't work.<br/>- Hmm.
Oh! Hey,
doorbell does not work.
Wait, wait, you're just getting<br/>this place inspected now?
- Well, yeah.<br/>- Ted...
All right. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
All right. Let's all remember that
we've all done<br/>some stupid things in our lives, okay?
For example, I once tried to ride my bike<br/>down an extension ladder
from the roof of a two-story house.
The only looming question is,
was I drunk or a kid?
- Drunk.<br/>- Kid.
Drum roll, please.
- I was...<br/>- Marshall's dead.
- A kid.<br/>- Marshall's dead. Marshall.
Moms, right?
Just always making a big deal<br/>out of nothing.
Came out of that coma in under a week.
Hey, let's check out the porch, huh?<br/>Come on.
I'm gonna put a grill out here,<br/>every Sunday, right here.
- It's gonna be a total sausage fest.<br/>- Hmm.
Sausage party? Burgers.<br/>Right, I'll do... We'll do burgers.
Ted, stop it. You can't keep this house.<br/>It's a huge mistake.
Lily, listen to me.
I had a plan, okay? Wife, house, kids.
As it turns out, the universe<br/>is being kind of a wad
about the whole wife and kids part.
So what's the one thing I can control?<br/>The house. I bought it.
It's not a huge mistake.
Exactly. Now, me driving my brother's car<br/>the wrong way down l-94,
that was a huge mistake.
- Drunk.<br/>- Kid.
I was...
A kid.
Wow, Barney, what,<br/>did you cry on that guy or something?
Uh... You got leaky pipes.<br/>But the bright side,
the pond in your basement is drowning<br/>some of the larger, slower rats.
The rest of them, well,<br/>they're headed this way.
See, you should've waited to find out<br/>the problems with this house.
You can always find problems<br/>with any decision.
But you can't let that stop you.
Freshman year, Marshall knew right away<br/>he wanted to spend his life with you.
What if someone had been there<br/>to second-guess that decision?
Bye.
I know we've only been on two dates,<br/>but, damn it, Lily Aldrin, I'm...
I'm gonna marry you.
Not so fast.
We got some structural issues here.
These hips are not<br/>Eriksen-baby compliant.
And this thing right here<br/>does not have a proper filter.
That's a maintenance issue<br/>that's never gonna go away.
And I know you think that<br/>you like this gothic exterior now,
but deep down, didn't you always<br/>picture yourself in something Spanish?
I recommend you look into<br/>the rental option.
But Marshall took that leap of faith,
and it's the best thing<br/>that ever happened to you both.
It was Robin.
"What?" Yes!<br/>It was Robin who cried at Clint's song.
"But she said..." I know what she said.
But here's what<br/>she didn't want you to know.
Listen, Barney, I can't stand<br/>all these jokes about me crying.
If I pretend to reveal that<br/>you were the one who cried,
will you go along with it?
Sure.
I made a mistake<br/>letting you go, didn't I?
Your penis is enormous.
Dude, you almost had us.
You always take it one too far.
Damn it.
All right, good news.<br/>I think we'll be out of here early.
- Really?<br/>- Yep.
I finished downstairs and the outside.
Now, I could keep looking<br/>and see what else I can find,
besides the black mold,<br/>the damaged retaining wall,
the frayed electrical wires,<br/>the lead paint, the water damage,
the fire damage, the sun damage,
the broken furnace,<br/>the rotted floorboards...
- Hey, look at that, no termites.<br/>- Ooh.
The cracked chimney,<br/>the bats, the rats, the spiders,
the raccoons,<br/>the hobo, the detached gutter,
the outdated fuse box
and the paint job in the kitchen,<br/>which is fine,
but the trim really clashes<br/>with the countertops.
Or I could just recommend
that you do not buy this godforsaken<br/>Guant?namo Bay of a house,
and suggest that<br/>we all get our asses out of here
before a medium-sized wind<br/>blows the whole sumbitch down.
What if...<br/>What if I already bought the sumbitch?
Well, I will check out the upstairs.
Did he say he found a hobo?
Okay, yes. There are problems.
But I see this house<br/>for what I know it can be.
I see a swing on that tree outside.
I see a wreath on the front door<br/>at Christmas,
I see a grill out on that patio,<br/>where I'll be barbecuing every weekend.
I see a life that I know I can have here.
Mama.
I see a lawsuit.
Found termites.
Bye.
Hey, well, the good news is, the inspector<br/>killed some roaches on impact.
Hold on.
Giant hole in second floor.
Just want to make sure<br/>the report is thorough.
Oh, you were right.
This was a huge mistake. It's just...
Everyone's moving on but me.<br/>You guys got a place years ago.
Robin's getting serious with Don.
Barney, maybe, that's a new tie?
Thank you. Jeez.
Now, my mom's remarried.
I'm exactly where I was five years ago.<br/>I'm sick of it. I'm...
I'm ready for the life<br/>that fits into this house.
That's all right, buddy.
Sometimes, people make<br/>the wrong decisions in life.
Like your mother.
What do you mean?
Ted, as you know, I've always been<br/>very, very fond of your mother.
Please don't.
In fact, Virginia and I<br/>shared a special moment
back in 2006 B.C.
Before Clint.
What the hell are you talking about?
I wanted to be your dad.
- What does that even mean?<br/>- Don't you talk back to me, young man.
That's why I cried at Clint's song.
Because that bastard<br/>took her away from me.
And now, all I'm left with
is the memory<br/>of dropping her off at the airport.
And that's how you got the brooch?
Unbelievable.
I was a little too tall<br/>Could've used a few pounds
So, here we are.
Here we are.
She was a black-haired beauty<br/>with big dark eyes
- We made good time.<br/>- Not a lot of traffic.
Stupid.
Oh, I love this song.
Do you? I can...
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields<br/>where the woods got heavy
Listen, Ted's mom.
I should really not... I...
Working on our night moves
Trying to make some front page<br/>drive-in news
Working on our night moves
Your penis is enormous.
Again. Always one too far.
Okay, all right, fine.<br/>That last part I made up.
But the rest of it, I swear, was true.<br/>Come on, dude, your mom is a cougar.
Wait, I thought you said<br/>a cougar can't be over 50.
Okay, she's a Mellencamp.
Guys, I am screwed.
I mean, the best I can do is level this place,<br/>and sell the property for a huge loss.
Look, Ted, usually in life,<br/>when you make a stupid decision,
you just have to live with it.
But how often do you get the chance
to pick up a sledgehammer<br/>and bash the living hell out of it?
This is stupid.
Your mom and I got to second base.
I light the fire
You place the flowers
In the vase that you bought today
Staring at the fire<br/>for hours and hours
While I listen to you
Thanks, Lily. That felt fantastic.
Aw! To Ted Mosby.
Homeowner, friend,<br/>and if he can rent it out, slumlord.
- Yeah.<br/>- Cheers.
There's...
There's one last thing I got to do.
And my friends didn't see me<br/>for the next 72 hours.
He was our ride.
Hi.
Ted, what are you doing here?
I never got to give you guys your toast.
I was selfish, and I freaked out,<br/>and I'm so sorry.
So here it is.
How about a hand for the DJ?<br/>Gesture to D...
I'll skip down.
Mom, I love you.
And I've never seen you<br/>as happy as you are with Clint.
And, Clint, welcome to the family.
What you two have<br/>is what I one day hope to find.
But until then, cheers to you both.
I love you guys.
Ted...
I am so
baked right now.
I'm only 60% sure<br/>you're actually standing in front of me.
But if you are,
I love you.
And you are the best son<br/>a mother could ever have.
There was no logical reason
why my mother<br/>should be with a guy like that.
And yet, as you kids know,
being with your Grandpa Clint was<br/>the best decision your grandma ever made.
Sometimes, our best decisions are<br/>the ones that don't make any sense at all.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, buddy.
How'd you know<br/>I was gonna be up here today?
Robin told me.
Happy house-warming.
But I told you last time I saw you,<br/>I'm selling the place.
I know what you said.
I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby.
Look, all the times over the years<br/>when I've said to you,
"Slow down,<br/>don't rush into things with this girl,"
you haven't listened to me<br/>a single damn time.
Your heart is both drunk and a kid.
Thanks for sticking up for me, man.
That's what I do.
Can I...<br/>Can I show you some of the ideas I have?
Yeah.
And kids, Marshall was right.<br/>I didn't give up on my dream house.
Because that's the thing<br/>about stupid decisions.
We all make them. But time is funny.
And sometimes a little magical.
It can take a stupid decision
and turn it into something else entirely.
Because, kids, as you know,
that house
is this house.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, your Aunt Robin<br/>had only been dating Don a short while,
when one evening, out of nowhere...
- Robin?<br/>- Hmm.
Do you wanna move in?
(STUTTERING) Well, it's kind of soon, but,<br/>sure, I would consider moving in here.
Just let me think about it.
No, I meant do you wanna move in<br/>on the couch so I could sit down?
Yeah. That's what I meant, too.
Like I said, just let me think about it.
- Okay.<br/>- Okay.
- Yeah. I'm okay with that.<br/>- Okay.
But now that you mentioned it,
do you wanna move in?
So, what did you say?
- I'm considering it.<br/>- You're considering it?
- Yeah.<br/>- You barely know him.
Plus, the guy's a loser with a dead-end job.
We have the same job, Barney.
- And we couldn't be prouder of you, angel.<br/>- Ugh.
Well, sweetie, this does seem kind of fast.
- Yeah.<br/>- Yeah, maybe you're right.
Well, I think you should move in with him.
- You do?<br/>- Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, I see how happy you are.
And as much as I love you as a roommate,
- I want you to do what's right for you.<br/>- Oh!
Are you trying to kick me out<br/>because of the milk thing?
It's really annoying.
(SHOUTING) Robin!
No. I have a system.
I put the empty carton back in the fridge<br/>to remind us to buy milk.
Okay, why don't you leave a full carton<br/>to remind us we don't have to buy milk?
All right, all right.
As your ex, before you jump into anything,
I need to meet this guy.
I think it's kind of weird<br/>that I haven't met him yet.
Totally weird. It's almost like someone
carefully orchestrated it that way<br/>on purpose.
Fine. But you have to promise<br/>to be on your best behavior.
I promise.
So, I'm banging<br/>this Portuguese contortionist
and I swear, she is so flexible,
at one point she was on top of me<br/>and underneath me.
Up top and down low!
One and two, bang!
- Who needs? Who needs? Who needs?<br/>- I'm good. I'm good.
And that would be Barney.
He means well.
Well, actually, I'm not sure that's true.
I think he's awesome.
But I feel bad for any woman<br/>with the kind of low self-esteem
who would actually date a guy like that.
OLDER TED: And that's when I realized
Robin never told Don<br/>she had dated Barney.
I like you, Don.
We both love a good Scotch.
- We both enjoy my compelling stories.<br/>- Yeah.
And we both dated Robin.
OLDER TED: Now he knew.
So, Barney's your ex<br/>and you still hang out with him?
I got to say<br/>I'm a little uncomfortable with that.
Oh, look, don't be. It's like we never dated.
Long story short,<br/>this exchange student's arms gave out,
and we both fell, ass over sex swing.
Seriously,<br/>I have not been able to find a girl
who can do that position since Robin.
Hey, Lily! Marshall!
How was your weekend away,<br/>or any other topic?
- Awful.<br/>- Terrible.
Twin beds?<br/>We can't sleep in separate beds.
We should go complain.
Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna march<br/>down there and demand another room.
Yeah, I'll go with you in just a sec.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
MAID: Housekeeping.
Could you come back later?<br/>We're taking a little catnap.
MAID: It's time to check out.
We slept for 18 hours.
- We missed four pre-paid meals.<br/>- I lost 11 pounds.
Hey, Ted, do you think it's weird<br/>that Robin is still friends with Barney?
I think it's weird<br/>that we're all still friends with Barney.
I just don't know how I feel<br/>about her hanging out
with one of her exes all the time.
OLDER TED: And that's when I realized<br/>Robin had failed to tell Don
about another one of her exes, me.
No, hanging out with one ex is fine.<br/>Even two, I'd give a pass.
Hell, two might be even better than one,
for some reason.
Yeah, but if you were dating someone
and he hung out with one of his exes<br/>all the time...
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. "He"?
Yeah, and he was friends<br/>with one of his exes...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, dude, dude, hold on.
Do you think I'm gay?
Well, yeah.
Why would you assume that?
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, Ted, your calligraphy teacher called.
- And? And?<br/>- Your ink is in.
Yes!
Hey, guys, I just wanna make sure<br/>Project Runway is recording.
Did the Jets get new costumes?
Well, I guess we won't be having<br/>creme brul?e tonight.
My browning torch is broken.
You know, when I heard your roommate<br/>was a single guy,
I was a little jealous.<br/>But now that I know he's gay, I'm okay.
Oh, Ted's not...
But we still got homemade lady fingers<br/>and piping hot Darjeeling.
Awesome. Thank you.
Ted's not what?
Ted's not gonna be around a lot.
He's following Cher on tour.
Okay, don't get me wrong,<br/>Cher puts on a hell of a show.
But I am not gay.
Hey, Lily, be honest.
Is it weird that Robin hangs out<br/>with one of her exes all the time?
Well, Ted and Robin broke up years ago.<br/>It's a non-issue.
Ted and Robin?
Not seeming so gay now, am I, Donny?
- Appletini for the gentleman.<br/>- Thank you.
You dated Ted, too?
Robin, of the four people you consider<br/>your best friends in New York,
you've slept with 50% of them.
- Don, they're just my friends.<br/>- Yeah, but they're also your exes.
And you live with one of them.
Look, I'm sorry, I got to...<br/>I got to think about all this.
- LILY: (SIGHING) Mmm.<br/>- Mmm.
MARSHALL: My God,<br/>she's a thousand degrees!
It's like putting my leg against a tailpipe.
LILY: Ow!<br/>His toenails are like daggers.
MARSHALL: I'd love a sandwich,
but no eating in bed.
Stupid rule.
We have ants one time.
LILY: Great, and now he's falling asleep.
Cue the river of drool.
(GRUNTS)
MARSHALL: My knee itches.
Just one little scratch.
Marshall!
I think we should get separate beds.
Yes! A mini fridge and separate beds.
Deal!
- Don.<br/>- Hi.
I came to apologize to all of you.<br/>I overreacted.
Well, we owe you an apology, too, Don.
- We said some pretty hurtful things.<br/>- No, you didn't.
Right, right, that was after you left.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth<br/>in the first place.
No, I acted like a total drama queen.
That's not offensive, right?
- Still not gay.<br/>- Sorry.
So, look, the point is you both<br/>are clearly very important to Robin.
So, why don't we all<br/>have dinner tomorrow night at my place?
Oh, that's great.
Looking forward to it, buddy.
- Thanks.<br/>- You're welcome.
- DON: You want to go?<br/>- Yeah.
- See you guys.<br/>- Bye.
Bye.
- Ted?<br/>- Yeah?
I must have Robin back.
- You're kidding, right?<br/>- No.
I don't know what it is,<br/>but I want Robin back.
I know what it is.
You're like a little kid<br/>who throws a toy away
and then wants it back the second<br/>another kid starts playing with it.
Well, maybe I wasn't done playing with it.
Maybe I just set it down
'cause I wanted to play with<br/>some other stuff for a second!
Okay.
You're ready.
Ready for what?
To read the letter.
OLDER TED: Kids,<br/>the letter was a device I'd invented
to remind myself<br/>why I'd broken up with somebody.
I'd been doing it for years.
"Dear Future Ted, never get back with<br/>Karen because she's a pretentious snob.
"Oh, also, she cheated on you.
"I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
(CHUCKLES)
"See, we're already laughing about it."
"Dear Future Ted, stay away from Natalie,
"or any girl who can pin you to the ground
"and beat you senseless<br/>in front of a cheering crowd.
"P.S. Please consult a therapist<br/>about why that turned you on a little bit. "
"Dear Relationship Genius,
"Stella left you at the altar.
"You may never love again<br/>and will probably die alone. "
Huh!
It doesn't look so sad<br/>written in calligraphy.
OLDER TED: So, when Barney and Robin<br/>broke up the previous fall...
Dating Robin was a huge mistake.
- Write that down.<br/>- What?
Write yourself a letter.
That way, when you miss Robin,<br/>and you will,
you can remind yourself why you broke up.
Gladly.
- "Dear Future Barney..."<br/>- Ooh!
- This ink is cool.<br/>- Right? Right?
"You and Robin..."
"Were a terrible couple.
"It just didn't work.<br/>Sure, you'll always love Robin,
"but remember other women?
"More importantly,<br/>remember other boobs?
"And all the<br/>cool stuff you can do with boobs?
"Nuzzle, juggle, honka-honka.
"I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic."
Then there's just<br/>a bunch of drawings of boobs.
- You get it now?<br/>- Yeah, I get it.
I definitely want her back.
(SIGHS)
I don't think human beings were<br/>ever meant to sleep in the same bed.
Somehow sex and sleep<br/>got all jumbled together,
but they're two different things.
I know. I mean, I love you,<br/>but I want this new bed
to be a sanctuary for sleep and sleep alone.
Me, too.<br/>And some light snacking, but that's it.
Hey, you know what we should get?
We should get a third bed just for sex.
Yes! A sex bed! A dirty, dirty sex bed!
It's genius. That way each bed<br/>would have a specific purpose.
Exactly.
We'll have two sleep beds, a sex bed,
and I'm thinking a bean bag chair,<br/>just for special birthday stuff.
Baby, did we just revolutionize<br/>modern marriage?
Damn straight!
(CLICKING TONGUE)
- Hey!<br/>- Hey!
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey, Don.
I hope you like sushi.
How cool is it that Don makes sushi?<br/>He learned while on assignment in Japan.
Ringworm-ilicious.
Barney, be nice. You only want her<br/>'cause you can't have her.
It's like if I said you can sit anywhere<br/>in this room except that chair.
Are you so petty that...
My chair! My chair!
Oh, spicy tuna with jalapeno! My favorite!
Mine, too. I love spicy food.<br/>The hotter the better.
I love spicy stuff, too, guy.
Probably more than you do.
- Check it.<br/>- Don't...
Super mild.
I'm not feeling it.
Hey, Lily, you won't believe it,<br/>it's the craziest thing.
Don has twin beds, too.
Oh, my God! We just got twin beds.
Oh, Oh. Great, great.
Well, wait, that "great"<br/>didn't sound so great.
Well, my ex-wife and I<br/>thought they'd be a good idea,
but we just started to drift apart. So...
Yeah, but I bet you didn't have<br/>another bed just for sex.
No, but she did<br/>at her personal trainer's house.
This chili is like an ice cube in my mouth.
I will say this, though.
I'm gonna get a king-size bed<br/>if Robin decides to move in.
Oh, I'd like that.
- Lf I move in.<br/>- Lf you move in.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Tokyo Don,
you ever do this back in Japan?
- Wasabi!<br/>- I wouldn't, Barney, no.
Hey. Oh, my God, Barney?
(EX CLAIMS)
- Awesome!<br/>- Give him some milk!
Spit it out, Barney! Spit it out!
Oh, we're out of milk.
But thanks for the reminder, Robin.
(EX CLAIMING)
ROBIN: Oh, sweet.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Hey, I stand by what I did.
It was bold and romantic.
You soiled yourself<br/>from both ends of your body.
Oh, come on! You have done<br/>tons of stupid stuff to impress Robin.
Yeah, I did, but I don't anymore,<br/>'cause I'm over her.
- Just like you are.<br/>- You are not over her.
You want her back just as much as I do.
You just won't let yourself go there.
That is ridiculous. And I'll tell you why.
"For my biographer"?
Just... Just focus on the letter, okay?
"Dear Ted, Robin is the perfect girl for you.
"But she doesn't wanna be<br/>in a serious relationship.
"You need someone<br/>who wants to settle down,
"so until Robin's ready for that next step,<br/>she's not your girl.
"Still, I'll always remember stealing her<br/>the blue French horn,
"our first kiss,
"the look in her eye<br/>when she told me she loved me."
Damn it.
Now I want her back.
OLDER TED: So, that night,<br/>your Uncle Barney and I sat down
to have a calm, rational discussion,<br/>about who deserved Robin more.
- No!<br/>- I stole her a blue French horn!
I dated her for a year!
I wanted her to be<br/>the mother of my children
and spend eternity in her arms.
See, I wanna have sex with her<br/>at least one more time!
She is mine!
She's not yours!<br/>And she's not mine, either.
- She's Don's.<br/>- You're right.
- We got to get rid of that guy.<br/>- Yeah.
- Yeah.<br/>- You know, figuratively.
Of course.
Or literally.
Oh, my God, Ted, this is how it starts!
This is how it starts!<br/>I'm scared, Teddy, I'm scared, Teddy!
(SHUSHING) Two guys talking.<br/>Just two guys talking.
Okay. Okay.
Marshall, I'm worried.
I don't wanna get divorced.
Oh, baby.
Honey, that's Don. That's not us.
Our new sleeping arrangement<br/>is only gonna bring us closer together.
Now get out of my bed.
Can we at least push them together?
Sure.
Oh, you meant the beds.<br/>No, I don't wanna do that.
Why not?
Baby, I love you more than life itself.
But you're a million degrees.
Honestly, I'm surprised<br/>your hourly pee breaks aren't just steam.
Well, you're no picnic in bed, either.
Oh, except for the food and the ants.
But, well, I still wanna be next to you.
Why? So you can kick me and slap me<br/>all night?
I swear to God, the second you fall asleep,<br/>it's like you grow extra limbs.
It's like spooning<br/>with a Hindu deity, Ganesh!
Wanna push them together?
You still talking about the beds?
- Nope.<br/>- Get over here.
- Robin Stinson!<br/>- Robin Mosby!
Robin Stinson!
Ted Scherbatsky!<br/>I'll take her name. I don't care.
Okay. Wait.<br/>How about this? How about this?
We share her.
I'll take her until she's 40,
and then you can have her after that.
Okay, who are we kidding?<br/>She's with Don now.
We just have to accept that, and move on.
You're right.
I'm gonna go to the...<br/>I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
and then I'll skedaddle.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hey, Robin, it's Barn Door.<br/>Guess what? I'm open.
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)
Hey, Barn Door, hang on.<br/>I'm getting another call.
Hello?
Hey, Robin, it's Teddy Bear.<br/>Need a little honey?
(GROWLING)
- No. Ted, hang on.<br/>- Okay.
Hey, Barney, I'm gonna have to<br/>call you back.
Ted's on the other line,<br/>and I think he's in trouble.
Ted's calling you? He's in trouble, all right!
Ted, what's up?
You have pretty hair. That's what's up.
And down your back.
(GROWLING SUGGESTIVELY)
(SCREAMING)
Wow.<br/>We almost let that get out of control.
Agreed.
I'm gonna get out of here<br/>before we do something we regret.
Robin! Robin, I love you!
- You son of a bitch!<br/>- Robin!
Robin, I brought you the blue French horn!
I brought you the blue French horn!<br/>Robin, Ted's just holding it for me.
Sorry, buddy, all's fair.
Oh, God. Guys, what are you doing?
Robin, I wanna win you back!
Hey, guys. Why don't you come upstairs?
Right.
All right, Don!
Let's settle this. You, me and Ted!
Yeah! A three-way.
Look, guys, Robin and I<br/>have to go do our show,
so why don't you have a seat<br/>on the couch, watch some television,
and we'll talk about this<br/>when we get back, okay?
Wow, you give up easy. Game, set, match.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
Where's...
Where's this TV<br/>you've been bragging about?
It's right here.
(BOTH SIGH)
- Thanks.<br/>- You're welcome.
- Good night, boys.<br/>- Good night.
Night, night, Papa.
- That was nice.<br/>- Yeah.
- Well, she gots to go.<br/>- What?
Oh, I'm sorry. That was a blast.<br/>And you're great.
But I have to be up early, so...
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Well, you're just kicking me out?
You knew what this was.
Lily, Lily, wait.
Don't forget your sweatshirt. Nice try.
Teddy Bear! Barn Door!
- Papa?<br/>- Rise and shine, jackasses!
So, do you guys remember<br/>anything from last night?
Yeah.
Boy, was Ted drunk. Embarrassing.
I'm really sorry. We both are.
We were drunk and stupid.
But we're gonna do anything we can
to make sure that Don feels<br/>a part of the group.
Don's not gonna be a part of the group.
And neither am I.
At least for a while.
Guys, this thing with Don is real.
And I wanna see where it goes.
And I'll never be able to do that<br/>if I keep hanging out
with my ex-boyfriends all the time.
It just won't work.
I'm moving in with Don.
(SINGING)<br/>It should be boredom by now
I know the tricks
So, what's going on with Robin?
You were right. She was just mad.
It's been four days, she hasn't said<br/>another word about moving out.
But listen, we can never<br/>pull crap like that ever again.
Agreed. In fact, I even wrote myself<br/>another letter.
"Dear Future Barney, you think you want<br/>Robin back again, but you really don't.
"Let her go. Sincerely, Past Barney."
- Let me see that.<br/>- Hey, hey, give it to me.
All right, all right,<br/>"P.S. That top part was just for Ted.
"Did he buy it? Good.
"Now get back together with Robin.
"But don't mention your plan to Ted,<br/>'cause he'll just screw it up again."
And then there's more drawings of boobs.
Okay, okay. In my defense,
how great are boobs?
- They're pretty great. They're pretty great.<br/>- So?
(EX CLAIMS)
(SHOUTING) Robin!
Just like a heavy drinker
I go for it every time

No to that.
I wish I could,<br/>but I have plans with Don on Saturday.
- He's making me Chinese.<br/>- I'll assume you're talking about food.
Otherwise, I have<br/>some follow-up questions.
I'm sorry, Lily, but I gotta give<br/>this thing with Don a chance.
And I can't do that if I'm out drinking<br/>with you guys every single night,
especially when "you guys"<br/>includes two of my ex-boyfriends.
I understand. You're right.
It's just we all really miss you.
Oh, I miss you, too. Listen, I gotta go.<br/>Talk soon. Okay. Bye.
Sorry, New York. I had to take that.<br/>Now, where were we?
Yeah, yes, bus crash.
She said no? How could she say no?
Robots vs. Wrestlers is our<br/>most important tradition as a group!
Tradition? We've never done this before.
It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily.
How is that not gonna be a tradition?
Well, this is how it starts.
First Robin moves in with Don,<br/>then Marshall and Lily have a baby,
- then Ted...<br/>- Gets married.
I was gonna say was found alone in<br/>his apartment, devoured by his cats,
but either way, not pretty.
Everyone's leaving me and I don't like it!
Oh, Barney, you don't have to worry<br/>about Marshall and me having kids.
That's a long way down the road.
Exactly. It's down the road,<br/>a medium way.
A medium long way.
- I mean, you can see it ahead.<br/>- In the vast, vast distance.
But you're already seeing exit signs for it.
- Really? I didn't see any.<br/>- You might wanna get in the right lane.
I understand how you feel, Barney.<br/>Friendships are important.
In fact, Emerson wrote<br/>a great poem entitled Friendship.
You guys are gonna love this.
"A ruddy drop of manly blood<br/>The surging sea outweighs"
(BARNEY MAKES FARTING NOISE)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
OLDER TED: That's how it had<br/>always been for me with the gang.
Any time I tried to get<br/>a little high-minded...
You guys, you gotta try this Syrah.
Hints of creme de cassis,<br/>red berries, toasty oak...
(MAKES FARTING NOISE)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hmm.
Five letters, blank baritone.
Of course. "Lyric" baritone, which is<br/>actually higher than a dramatic baritone.
You know, there's a telling moment<br/>in the second act of La Boheme...
(MAKES FARTING NOISE)
(MARSHALL LAUGHING)
Guys, come on. I'm just trying to<br/>add a little class to these proceedings.
It's like that line from Dante's Inferno.
- (MAKES FARTING NOISE)<br/>- (BOTH LAUGHING)
"Consider your origins.<br/>You were not born to live like brutes.
(MAKES FARTING NOISE)
"But to follow virtue and knowledge."
(MAKES LOUD FARTING NOISE)
Or, in the original Italian...
(ALL GROANING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(ALL MAKING FARTING NOISES)
You guys are right. I'm totally<br/>overreacting to this whole Robin thing.
What's this envelope?<br/>Is this a wedding invitation?
Robin's marrying Don!<br/>I'm gonna die alone!
Ted's gonna get eaten by cats!
Dude, relax. It's for Marissa Heller.
Marissa Heller? She sounds hot.
Face, boobs, describe. Start with boobs.
OLDER TED: Who was Marissa Heller?
That mystery began when<br/>Marshall and I first moved in together.
Ted, we got our first mail delivery!
We are popular.
We've got a golf magazine<br/>for Marissa Heller.
We got a wicker furniture catalog,<br/>also for Marissa Heller.
And a coupon for a bird store<br/>addressed to Marissa Heller,
or, stay with me,
"current occupant." That's us!<br/>We've got mail!
Fantastic!
Marissa Heller? She must be<br/>the woman who lived here before us.
I wonder what she was like.
OLDER TED: And just like that,<br/>a picture began to take shape.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
A picture of Marissa Heller, the golfer.
Marissa Heller, the wicker catalog shopper.
And Marissa Heller, the bird owner.
And since then,<br/>with each piece of mail we've gotten,
the picture's become a little clearer.
The only thing we don't know is<br/>what she looks like.
Well, I guess I'll forward this along like<br/>I've been forwarding along
- all the other... Okay.<br/>- Oh, just open it.
It's an invitation to Jefferson Van Smoot's<br/>Annual Spring Social this Saturday night,
in the penthouse apartment of the Alberta!
You guys, that's the most<br/>beautiful building in Manhattan.
We gotta go to this party.
That depends.<br/>Does it say anything on that invitation
about robots battling wrestlers<br/>for intergalactic supremacy?
- No. But it says open bar.<br/>- Revised agenda for Saturday night.
Free booze at Marissa Heller's party,<br/>then Robots vs. Wrestlers.
One of us just needs to pretend<br/>to be Marissa Heller.
(LAUGHS) Oh, guys, I'm flattered.<br/>But I think Lily should do it.
OLDER TED: So the big night arrived.
Our first stop, the Alberta building.
Wow! This building is amazing!
Did you guys see the porte cochere<br/>and the terracotta spandrels outside?
Oh, my God!<br/>Look, I just got a text from Robin.
It says...
(MAKES FARTING NOISE)
Okay, guys, huddle up.
Now, Lil, you can do this.
All you have to do is look<br/>that guy in the eyes,
say your name is Marissa Heller,<br/>and we are golden.
And again, just so we're clear, no accent.
Are we sure she's not British, innit?
- ALL: No!<br/>- No!
All right. Here I go. I'm doing this.
- Hi.<br/>- Hello.
Sorry. Go ahead.
I'm here for the Van Smoot party.<br/>My name is Marissa Heller.
Bollocks.
So that's Marissa Heller, huh.
She fine.
Her teeth look really nice.
She must be remembering<br/>to go to the dentist
even without those reminder postcards.
So, what are we doing?
I'm getting us into the party, that's what.
Marissa Heller! Barney Stinson.
We met at that gathering for bird owners.
I don't think so.
- Wicker lovers?<br/>- No.
Stinson out.
- Guys, it's not gonna happen.<br/>- I got this.
You know, this elevator still uses<br/>the same mechanism
from when it was first installed in 1906.
Rumor is, Louis Lamar Skullnick,<br/>the architect who designed this building,
carved these panels himself.
- Oh! A Skullnick fan?<br/>- Well...
I love his juxtaposition between<br/>the North German Renaissance exterior...
And the decidedly French influence<br/>on the inside. I know!
He was an architect<br/>with the soul of a poet, really.
No, no, no, don't, don't. It's working.
You know, I have a confession to make.<br/>We're not on the guest list.
But I've always wanted to see<br/>the inside of the Alberta.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Well, then, right this way.<br/>We're all together.
Told you I'd get us in.
So, anyone been watching<br/>The Young and the Restless?
(GASPS) Awesome!<br/>Who ordered Soap Opera Illustrated?
Huh. Marissa Heller, I like your style.
Anyone?
Am I to understand that there isn't a single<br/>soap opera fan in this entire elevator?
Hmm?
I don't own a TV.<br/>The only operas I watch are at the MET.
Dibs.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh! Excuse me. Jefferson, darling!
Wow, I am not dressed for this.
One word, made up. Douche-pocalypse.
Guys, that's Peter Bogdanovich<br/>talking to Arianna Huffington
and Will Shortz,<br/>editor of the New York Times crossword!
Look, let's give this party a chance, okay.<br/>There's free food, free booze.
Twenty minutes, then we can leave.
But you see, music was changing,
and Giovanni Artusi simply didn't<br/>understand the new style of composing.
Excuse me.
Are you talking about Monteverdi<br/>and his fourth book of madrigals?
My dear chap, what else?
That's my favorite book of madrigals!
Smoked foie gras with caramelized mango<br/>and creme fra?che?
Hey, hey, guy. You have anything<br/>in the mini-cheeseburger department?
I don't think so, sir.
No. Mini-pizzas? Little cups of fries?
Any food at all<br/>that'll make me feel like a giant?
I'll check, sir.
He's not gonna check.
I'm performing open heart surgery<br/>on the Dutch ambassador in the morning.
I hope he pulls through.
Really? A colleague of mine just prescribed<br/>Coumadin to the Dutch ambassador.
And there's no way<br/>she'd be on anticoagulants
if she were about to undergo surgery.
Just... Okay.
You know who published<br/>a great article on Walt Whitman
and the politics of semantics?<br/>Professor Hammersmith of Oxford.
I am Professor Hammersmith.
What?
Which is exactly<br/>what Truffaut was talking about
in his 1954 article in Cahiers du cin?ma.
Film is an auteur's medium, full stop.
(LAUGHING)
Movies. Right?
Actors.
Willem Dafoe.
Funny thing about Willem Dafoe.
His name kind of sounds like a frog<br/>talking to a parrot.
Willem. Dafoe!
Willem. Dafoe!
No?
As Under Secretary of the Treasury,<br/>I had a big hand in crafting that legislation.
Now, I wonder if you'd like to join me<br/>in the map room,
and give my package some stimulus.
I'm afraid, my darling,<br/>you're too old for my taste.
Hey, Zsa Zsa Gabor is still looking pretty<br/>hot, but otherwise, this party sucks.
Yeah, well, we gave it a chance.<br/>It's been 20 minutes.
- Let's get out of here. Where's Ted?<br/>- Yeah.
I know how to find him.<br/>Just give me one minute.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Gongs, right?<br/>They're louder than you think.
Young man,<br/>that gong is a 500-year-old relic
that hasn't been struck<br/>since W.S. Gilbert hit it
at the London premiere<br/>of The Mikado in 1885.
Ooh.
His wife's a 500-year-old relic that<br/>hasn't been struck since W.S. Gilbert hit it
at the London premiere<br/>of The Mikado in 1885.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, Will Shortz!<br/>Editor of the Times crossword!
You know how I've been saying,<br/>"They always use Ulee from Ulee's Gold
"because of the vowels"?<br/>Well, tell them, Will, tell them.
- Because of the vowels.<br/>- It's because of the vowels!
Wow. Ted, can I talk to you<br/>just for a second?
Hey, Will. Ten-letter word for<br/>diminutive egg-based torte?
- Mini-quiche? Where?<br/>- Right there.
Such a great party! Such a great party!
Yeah, totally. Ted, it's time to go.<br/>It's Robots vs. Wrestlers o'clock!
Oh.
Ted? There you are.
We'll be blind taste testing French whites<br/>in a bit.
It should be a hoot and a half.
Well, I decant miss that.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I know, you don't have to say it.<br/>You don't decant white wine.
Miss Lily, in the living room,<br/>with the candlestick.
JEFFERSON: Oh, my heavens, no!<br/>That was Edgar Allan Poe's!
Sorry.
Guys, listen. I'm having fun here,
so I think I'm gonna skip<br/>Robots vs. Wrestlers.
(GASPING)
But, Ted, you've never<br/>missed Robots vs. Wrestlers.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Ted, this isn't happening.
First, Robin ditches us and now you!
And for these stuffy, pretentious snoots!
Actually, I kind of like<br/>these stuffy, pretentious snoots.
They don't make fart noises<br/>every time I open my mouth.
Well, look, I'm gonna stay.<br/>I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Yeah, come on, Barney. It's just one night.<br/>- It doesn't mean anything.
Oh! It means everything.
Ted, if you don't come<br/>to Robots vs. Wrestlers,
it's the end of our friendship.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Fine. Then you are out of our gang forever.
You can re-apply in two years.<br/>Marshall, Lily.
Let's go watch wrestlers fight robots.
So embarrassing. I forgot something.
So, Ted, where did those chums of<br/>yours scoot off to?
Oh! You know, a poetry reading.
(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Best tradition ever.
Don't humor me, Marshall.
Let's face it, the gang is over.
Ted's gone, Robin's gone.
We might as well just go<br/>our separate ways.
God, Barney,<br/>enough with the abandonment issues.
Ted's allowed to have<br/>a life outside of the group. We all are.
Wait a minute.<br/>Why are you saying that all of a sudden?
- Oh, God, you're pregnant!<br/>- No!
Oh, God, you already had the baby!
It's right behind me, isn't it?
No, you idiot. It's just...
Eventually, we're all gonna move on.<br/>It's called growing up.
ROBOT: Is that all you got, bitch?
But can you at least promise me that<br/>you won't get pregnant for another year?
Can't make that promise.
- You can't?<br/>- You can't?
(ALL CHEERING)
Mmm.
Citrus and honeycomb flavors<br/>with crisp acidity.
It's a Sauv blanc, Loire Valley.<br/>Town of Sancerre.
(SIGHS) Correct again! Bravo, boy.
(CHUCKLING)
No, you can't have kids!
You don't want to bring a child<br/>into this crazy, messed up world.
I don't know. The world seems<br/>pretty awesome right now, Barney.
(ROBOT WHIRRING)
Okay, Lily, you leave me no choice.
If you have a daughter, the day,<br/>nay, the minute she turns 18,
gong!
Oh, God!
But, Lily, Lily, babies.
(COOING)
I hope Ted is miserable right now.
ALL: (SINGING) Constance Fry<br/>Constance Fry
Anytime you call
Constance will fulfill your needs
Winter, spring or fall
Ted, your lyric baritone is outstanding.
Thank you, Will Shortz.
Fine, you guys can have a baby,<br/>but only under these conditions.
One, you promise to always love me<br/>more than the baby.
Two, once a month I get to use<br/>the baby to pick up chicks.
Three, that may involve<br/>the baby falling from a two-story window
and me heroically catching it.
Four, no breast-feeding in front of me.
Five, forget about four. You can<br/>whip them out whenever you want.
(IMITATES WHIP)
OLDER TED: And then,<br/>something amazing happened.
(WRESTLER GRUNTING)
(LILY GASPING)
- Holy crap!<br/>- I don't believe it!
(EX CLAIMING)
Well, of course, hell is an<br/>interesting concept, isn't it?
I've always loved to imagine it<br/>as Dante did in The Divine Comedy.
If you'll allow me. In the original Italian.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
TED: I can't believe this.
I'm reciting The Divine Comedy<br/>in its original Italian,
and nobody's making fart noises!
Wow, this is weird.<br/>I've never gotten this far.
You know,<br/>I actually sound kind of douchey.
My God. I'm out of control.
Listen to me. I'm completely unleashed.<br/>I'm the biggest douche on the planet.
(TED CONTINUES SPEAKING ITALIAN)
I wish somebody would stop me.
OLDER TED: And then, somebody did.
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)
(EX CUSES HIMSELF IN ITALIAN)
OLDER TED: Kids, I think I told you<br/>how earlier that year
we had seen some doppelgangers<br/>of ourselves around town.
There was Lesbian Robin.
(SPITTING)
(LILY LAUGHING)
There was Mustache Marshall.
And, of course, Stripper Lily.
Well, that night,<br/>one more doppelganger surfaced.
Mexican Wrestler Ted.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(ALL CHEERING)
(METALLIC CLANGING)
(EX CLAIMING)
I gotta go.
(DRUNKENLY) Rule number 83,
if anything that comes out of<br/>that baby gets on one of my suits,
I get to touch Lily's boobs.
Dude, what is it with you<br/>and my wife's boobs tonight?
Hey, hey! I don't make the rules.
Baby, are you really starting to<br/>think about this?
I don't know. Well, maybe a little.
Okay. Well, for whatever it's worth,<br/>I think that we're ready.
You know, look, we love each other,<br/>we're financially stable
and honestly, I don't think it would change<br/>our lifestyle all that much.
OLDER TED: Aunt Lily still likes to<br/>remind Uncle Marshall he once said this.
Marshall, if we were at home<br/>with a baby tonight,
we never would've seen<br/>Ted's doppelganger.
Imagine missing that.<br/>How would that feel?
I would blame that child<br/>for the rest of his life.
Exactly. For the rest of her life.
Okay, you're right. There's no hurry.
Okay, how about this?<br/>We agree there's no sense in having a baby
until we've seen<br/>all five doppelgangers, right?
Of course. Stands to reason.
Okay, so, when we finally<br/>see Barney's doppelganger,
that's the universe telling us it's go time,
and that's when we'll start trying. Deal?
Deal.
Hey, guys.
Well, well.<br/>Look who thinks he can just waltz in here,
and be part of the gang again.
Well, you can forget it.
- Listen, Barney, I...<br/>- Please be part of the gang again!
I don't wanna lose anyone else!<br/>We're all really sorry.
We'll even let you recite<br/>all the douchey poems you want,
and we'll never, never say<br/>a bad thing about it. I promise.
Really? Because there actually<br/>is a poem I'd like to recite.
Friendship, by Ralph Waldo Emerson.
"A ruddy drop of manly blood<br/>The surging sea outweighs
"The world uncertain comes and goes"
(MAKES FARTING NOISE)
I'm sorry. Someone had to do that.
Who wants another drink? I'm buying.
OLDER TED: Kids, I'd love to tell you<br/>that over the years,
we didn't all drift apart<br/>a little at one time or another.
You don't mean for it to happen,<br/>but it does.
But no matter what, to this day,
come hell or high water,
we still all get together every year<br/>for Robots vs. Wrestlers.
Good night. Thanks a lot.<br/>I had a great time.
Willem. Dafoe!
Willem. Dafoe!
Willem. Dafoe!

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, when you're in your 20s,<br/>dating is great.
But by the time you reach your 30s,
you find out pretty fast<br/>everyone has baggage.
Sure you can stick to the small talk,<br/>and pretend it's not there,
but sooner or later...
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)<br/>- Oh!
It's my ex.<br/>Sorry, we're trying to remain friends.
Hi, pumpkin.<br/>Did you get our tickets to Maui?
OLDER TED: Yeah, it's there.
That spring, I had just started dating<br/>a girl named Royce.
She was smart, beautiful...
Blah, blah, blah,<br/>we're very happy together.
- But...<br/>- Exactly. That's the problem.
Her butt?
- What is it, too much?<br/>- Too little?
Or is it an issue of access?
(LAUGHS)
No. The but is,<br/>there's always gonna be a but.
No matter how great things are going,<br/>sooner or later, it's gonna get ruined.
When she turns 30.
When I find out what her baggage is.
It's there. I don't know what it is,<br/>but when I do, party's over.
Whoa! Ted, please tell me you are<br/>not impugning emotional baggage.
Baggage is a good thing?
Emotional baggage is the bedrock of<br/>America's most important cultural export.
- ALL: Porn.<br/>- Porn.
Actually, it's porn.
Only women with major baggage<br/>go into porn.
- Major baggage.<br/>- Major baggage.
Ted, everyone has baggage,<br/>you just gotta look past it.
Really? 'Cause the last time<br/>I looked past a girl's baggage,
that baggage belonged<br/>to a girl named Stella, and...
Oh, I'm drawing a blank here.<br/>How did that work out again?
OLDER TED: Here's how it worked out.
I asked her to marry me,<br/>she said yes. We were happy.
But then the day of the wedding,<br/>her karate instructor ex-boyfriend,
Tony Grafanello, showed up,<br/>declared his love for her,
and Stella ran off with him to California,
leaving me utterly<br/>and completely heartbroken.
Ted, look, what happened<br/>with Stella was awful.
But that doesn't mean anyone<br/>with baggage is undateable.
Well, I'm just glad that we met young<br/>enough that I don't have any baggage.
- Mother issues.<br/>- I do not.
- Grandmother issues.<br/>- Definitely do not.
- Great-grandmother issues.<br/>- I just don't like it when she picks me up.
And you know what<br/>your biggest baggage is? You're too nice.
How is being nice baggage?
Have you ever seen<br/>you walk down the street?
I don't even know how to answer that.
Well, let me help you out.
Michael. Javier. Marcello.
Suzanne.<br/>Hey, Deng. Let me help you with that.
That ought to do it.
Oh, guys, no. I could not today.<br/>It would just be...
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXHALES FORCEFULLY)
That's normal.
There is only one street<br/>where that is normal.
Here's a hint,<br/>a giant yellow bird lives on it.
Well, I'll be pretty happy if Royce's<br/>only baggage is that she's too nice.
Too nice?<br/>That is the worst kind of baggage.
Best baggage, hates her dad,
and thinks she's fat but isn't.
Angry sex on the first date,
and then as soon as you<br/>mention breakfast, she's gone.
Why do you guys hang out with me?
OLDER TED: That night,<br/>on my date with Royce,
I kept waiting to see<br/>what her baggage would be.
So is spaghetti your specialty?
No. The main event is my pancakes.
I'll make them for you sometime.<br/>They are insane.
My dad used to make<br/>multi-grain pancakes.
He's the one who got me working in porn.
You know PORN,<br/>Parents Offering Recreation and Nutrition.
It's a charity for inner-city teens who don't<br/>have access to sports or healthy food.
(EXHALES IN RELIEF)
That reminds me, I killed my brother
with this joke I told him last night.
A barber, a stripper and a Jew...
...lliard-trained violinist,<br/>walked into a bar.
OLDER TED: I looked and looked<br/>and looked,
but it really appeared as though<br/>there was no baggage to worry about.
Until we went to go see a movie.
Oh, no.
Hey, what took you guys so long?
Nothing. Forget about it.
We were on our way here,
and Marshall wanted to stop and help<br/>some guys load their moving van.
To be nice. Didn't cost nothing.
And when the moving van drove away,<br/>who should show up
but the owner of the apartment<br/>we had just helped some guys rob.
And that one was hard to explain<br/>to the police.
See, Marshall, this is what I mean.
You can't treat New York City like it's<br/>the small, friendly, crime-free, inbred,
backwoods, Podunk, cow-tipping<br/>Minnesota hickville where you grew up.
Crime-free? Crime-free?
In 1994, the cashier from the feed store<br/>was held up at hoe-point.
And besides, I like being friendly, okay?<br/>I'm not gonna change that about myself.
No, don't change, baby. I think it's sweet.
Sweet, sweet, sweet mother of God.<br/>He's an idiot sometimes.
He actually lent the burglars gas money.
He gave them money?
Not gave, lent.<br/>They said that they would send us a check,
so Marshall gave them our address.
What's to stop them from coming<br/>to our apartment one night,
and maybe tying me up?
I mean, sure, Marshall and I like to<br/>pretend, but the reality is scary.
Why don't you say something to him?
(GROANS) What's the point?<br/>He's from Minnesota.
His high school mascot was a hug.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey, how'd the date with Royce go?
It was interesting. We went to see<br/>that new movie, The Wedding Bride.
Oh! How was it?
Not that I care. I mean, it's a chick flick.
This one will probably drag me to it,<br/>like the 7:10 show tomorrow night,
or 9:40 because I have that meeting,<br/>but I can probably get out of it,
so let's try for the 7:10.
- ROBIN: What's that movie about, anyway?<br/>- That's the interesting part.
Hey, bonehead! I'm Jed Mosley.
I'm the most powerful<br/>and corrupt architect in New York.
I... (SCREAMING)<br/>That's gonna leave a mark!
It's about me.
- The Wedding Bride is about you?<br/>- Yeah.
Okay, are you sure it's about you?<br/>Because when I saw Spaceballs
- for the first time, I could've sworn...<br/>- This movie is about me, Marshall.
- It was written by Tony Grafanello.<br/>- Tony Grafanello? That's...
Yeah, the guy that Stella left me for.
This movie is the whole<br/>story of our breakup.
(LAUGHS) Why would<br/>he write a movie about that?
Isn't he the bad guy in that story?
Yeah, and the good guy is<br/>a guy named Ted Mosby.
Funny, that was my memory of it, too.
But, according to the movie...
SECRETARY ON INTERCOM:<br/>Mr. Mosley, your fianc?e is here.
Great. The old ball and chain.
I can't wait to make her move out<br/>of her beautiful house in New Jersey
and come live with me in an apartment<br/>above a bar. Send her in.
Ah, Stella. To what do I owe the pleasure?
We're supposed to taste wedding cakes<br/>this afternoon, remember?
Ouch!
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.
Whoa!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(SIGHING)
AUDIENCE: Aw!
- Well, I am stunned.<br/>- Right.
That's what passes for comedy<br/>these days?
Whoa! "I'm falling back in my chair."
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)
Whoa.
- I'm really falling back in my chair.<br/>- LILY: Baby.
MARSHALL: Okay, that was pretty funny.
What a jerk. Did he at least get<br/>someone hot to play me?
- You're not in it.<br/>- (SIGHING) What a jerk.
No, no, no, no, no. Tony's not a jerk,<br/>not according to the movie, anyway.
I'm going through with this wedding.<br/>I'm sorry, Tony.
Stella, your happiness is<br/>the only thing I care about,
except for these underprivileged children<br/>that I work with for free.
AUDIENCE: Aw!
I love him.
It's not that easy, Tony.
Jed Mosley may not be as handsome<br/>as you are, or as tall as you are...
I'm taller than that guy.
... and our sex life is terrible.
Once he even fell asleep<br/>while we were doing it. I mean...
It was one time. I was on cold medicine.
- What?<br/>- Nothing.
This is a terrible movie!<br/>And it got everything wrong.
Remember how I proposed to Stella?
TED: That spontaneous moment<br/>in the arcade.
I didn't have a ring, so I gave her a toy<br/>I won from a crane machine?
- Oh, that was so sweet.<br/>- So romantic.
A little cheesy.
Well, here's how it went in the movie.
Look, if it'll shut you up,<br/>I guess we can get married.
Well, aren't you gonna give me a ring?
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.
- Here. Put this on your finger.<br/>- Hey!
And remember the two-minute date?
TED: When I squeezed<br/>an entire romantic evening
into just two minutes<br/>to accommodate Stella 's busy schedule?
- Oh, Ted, you're such a good guy.<br/>- That was really nice.
Also, a little cheesy.
Well, according to the movie...
What about our big romantic weekend?
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.
Alls I got time for is a two-minute date,<br/>if you know what I mean.
Sex.
Whoa!
(THUDDING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
(SIGHING)
AUDIENCE: Aw!
Hey, if you know what you're doing,<br/>two minutes is all you need.
Run tell dat.
But the worst, the worst, was the ending.<br/>So they're at the wedding...
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley to be<br/>your lawfully-wedded husband?
- I...<br/>- Whoa! Spoilers!
Is what I would say if I ever<br/>plan on seeing such an awful film.
Continue.
So they're at the wedding.
- I...<br/>- Stella!
- Tony!<br/>- Tony?
Something I need to say.
A long time ago, I let this beautiful girl<br/>named Stella get away.
And now she's with some jerk
who doesn't appreciate what he has<br/>in this beautiful, wedding bride.
AUDIENCE: Oh!
What is wrong with you people?
You can't talk to me like that.<br/>I'm Ted Mosley!
Did he say Ted that time?
(SHUSHING)
Stella, I promised to make you my wife.<br/>And I'd like to live up to that promise.
Oh, Tony, all I've wanted<br/>all my life was your love.
Oh, go on, honey. Kiss him.
- ALL: Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him...<br/>- Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him...
Stella, if you still truly love me,
can you let me make you<br/>my wedding bride?
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.
No! No! No! Stop doing that!
Daddy!
(GROANS)
Take that, Ted Mosby.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Okay, he definitely said it that time.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
(SIGHING)
Oh, my God. That was so good!<br/>I'm laughing. I'm crying.
I know it's all fake, but didn't<br/>those seem like real characters?
It was just so real.
Hey, how come you said "oh, no"<br/>when the movie started?
OLDER TED: That's when I realized<br/>everyone has baggage, including me.
Oh, uh, no reason.
Ted, I think you need to tell Royce
the story of what happened<br/>with you and Stella.
It's gonna come out eventually.
Why? Why does it even have to?
Well, for starters, it's now the fifth<br/>highest-grossing movie of all time.
I don't care. I don't care.<br/>I'm taking this to the grave.
It's a stupid movie, anyway.
Sounds terrible.
My gosh, I would<br/>never go and see that film.
(ALL CHATTERING)
OLDER TED: Kids,<br/>you know where this is going.
Well, she's made her choice.
Don't worry. I won't go to the wedding.
Oh, you'll go all right.
I'm gonna drive you there myself<br/>and make you watch.
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)
Billy, no! The code.
This is exactly how it happened.<br/>He got every part right.
Even that thing with the nunchucks.
OLDER TED: So I was resolved<br/>to put The Wedding Bride
as far behind me as possible.
Unfortunately...
Oh! How great was The Wedding Bride?
(BOTH EX CLAIMING)
- Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!<br/>- We're going to see it again tomorrow.
Ooh! Can we come?<br/>Ted, you wanna see it again, right?
Yeah. It was good.
"Good"? Try instant classic.<br/>The only thing wrong with it,
and I mean, it's such a minor flaw<br/>in an otherwise flawless film,
is I just didn't get why Stella would even<br/>wanna marry a guy like Jed Mosley
in the first place.<br/>I mean, even that guy's name, Jed Mosley.
Come on, Royce. You've dated<br/>a few Jed Mosleys in your day.
Well, okay. But who hasn't?
He's such a type. The butterfly tattoo,<br/>the way he pronounces encyclopedia.
- Encyclopaedia.<br/>- Encyclopaedia.
Totally. Totally. All right, well,<br/>technically, that is the correct...
I was so, so happy when that loser<br/>got left at the altar, and you know why?
- Because he had it coming.<br/>- Mmm-hmm.
And the great part is he is gonna live
a long, sad life, knowing that he lost<br/>his only chance at happiness.
Oh! What about when he got beat up<br/>by the goat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)<br/>- So funny. What a loser.
Totally! I mean, the guy's life was<br/>shattered in a very public humiliation.
What a hoot!
And it may be years before he can look<br/>certain family members in the eye again.
He may be so emotionally traumatized
he never fully loves<br/>or trusts anyone ever again.
That's hysterical. Move over, Adolf Hitler.<br/>There's a new king of comedy.
Ted, are you okay?
Yeah. I just think you all might be<br/>interested to learn something about
that movie y'all love so much.
It sucks. And you're all stupid for liking it.
Wow. That was really mean.<br/>I think you owe us an apology.
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.
No-can-do's-ville.
You said, "No-can-do's-ville, babydoll"?
You actually used<br/>Jed Mosley's catchphrase?
I know. I was just so upset that...
How do you know that's his catchphrase?
- You said it was his catchphrase.<br/>- They dragged me to it. I didn't wanna go.
- I wanted to see A vatar again.<br/>- TED: All right, that's it.
I'm just gonna move to some country<br/>where no one's seen The Wedding Bride.
Good luck, Ted.<br/>That movie is worldwide. It's huge.
- Maybe North Korea.<br/>- Nope.
I read that Kim Jong II said it was<br/>his second favorite movie of all time.
Right behind a movie of him riding a horse<br/>in slow motion through a field of turnips.
Sorry, Ted. You're screwed.
No. You know what?<br/>No, Ted is not screwed.
All right, do you guys wanna know<br/>why I'm nice to everyone?
It's because I don't care about baggage.
I mean, most people, they see<br/>another person walking down the street
with that big heavy bag they're carrying,<br/>and they just walk on by.
But not me. I look at them, and I say...
I say, " Howdy, stranger.<br/>Can I give you a hand with that?"
And you know who taught me to be<br/>that way? A guy called Ted Mosby.
A guy who's uncynical and sincere<br/>and believed in things.
And you know what, Ted? I believe<br/>that deep down, you're still that guy.
I am still that guy.
I think you wanna go out there<br/>and get that girl.
I do wanna go out there and get that girl.
- Because she's the love of your life!<br/>- Because she's...
Well, okay, let's... We're three dates in.<br/>She seems nice.
- Because she seems nice!<br/>- She does seem nice!
You're right, Marshall. I gotta go get her.
And I know exactly where she is.
The wedding's in 15 minutes.<br/>I'll never make it.
You can do it, sensei. Go give love<br/>a roundhouse kick right in the heart.
You're right. What am I doing?
There's still time.
MINISTER: Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley<br/>to be your lawfully-wedded husband?
STELLA: I...
(CLEARING THROAT)
- Royce?<br/>- Stella?
- Ted?<br/>- Tony!
- Tony?<br/>- Ted?
Barney?
(SLURPING)
Something I need to say.
Look, there's something I need to say.
- A long time ago...<br/>- A long time ago,
- I let a horrible girl named Stella...<br/>...I let this beautiful girl named Stella...
...break my heart.<br/>...get away.
- And now she's with some jerk...<br/>- And now she's with this jerk
- who wrote a movie about it and...<br/>...who doesn't appreciate what he has
- in this beautiful, wedding bride.<br/>...that movie is called The Wedding Bride.
- What are you saying?<br/>- JED: You can't talk to me like that.
- I'm Jed Mosley!<br/>- I'm Jed Mosley. But, Royce...
TONY: This girl<br/>in the white wedding dress...
...this doofus in the red cowboy boots,
- this isn't me.<br/>- TONY: This isn't you.
So, just to be clear,
are you saying that you don't have a pair<br/>of red cowboy boots in your closet?
Barney, what...
Well, I just wanted... I mean, that's...<br/>Everyone wants to know.
They're actually more of a burgundy.
- Royce...<br/>- Stella,
- I promised to make you my wife.<br/>...I promised to make you some pancakes.
- And I'd like to live up to that promise.<br/>- And I'd like to live up to that promise.
- STELLA: Tony, all I've wanted all my life...<br/>- Ted, all I've wanted all week...
- STELLA: Was your love.<br/>Was some pancakes.
- MINISTER: Go on, honey. Kiss him.<br/>- Go on, honey. Kiss him.
- GUESTS: Kiss him, kiss him...<br/>- Kiss him, kiss him...
OLDER TED: Um, Uncle Barney<br/>didn't say "kiss."
Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him!
OLDER TED: Still not saying "kiss."
Sir, you need to leave, now!
This is outrageous! Who the kiss are you?
- Stella, if you still truly love me...<br/>- Royce, if you still kind of like me...
... can you let me make you<br/>my wedding bride?
...can you let me make you<br/>some pancakes?
- Can-do's-ville, babydoll.<br/>- STELLA: Can-do's-ville, babydoll.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
JED: No! No! No! Stop doing that!
- Kiss this. Kissing movie's over, anyway.<br/>- Sir!
BARNEY: Oh. Oops, oops!
Hey,
that stuff that happened to me,
it was pretty rough.<br/>I'm still getting over it.
Let me help you with that.
OLDER TED: And just like that, kids,
my baggage didn't seem<br/>quite so heavy anymore.
You see, everyone's got some baggage.<br/>It's part of life.
But like anything else, it's easier when<br/>someone gives you a hand with it.
Wow, it feels so good to have told<br/>you all that stuff about me.
I'm really glad I can open up to you.
Ted, it's not that big of a deal.
Heck, I've been left at the altar.
Three times.
The last time was because<br/>I blew all our money on online poker.
That's why I live with my brother now.
Wait, I thought you said you had<br/>a tiny studio apartment.
Yup, just the two of us.<br/>You should see how he hogs the covers.
(GROANS)
Yeah, you gotta go.
ENGLISH - US - SDH
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">OLDER TED: Kids, up to this point<br/>in the story, we had found doppelgangers,
eerie but awesome look-alikes, for four of<br/>the five members of our little group.
There was Lesbian Robin...
(SPITTING)
Mustache Marshall,
Stripper Lily...
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
And Mexican Wrestler Me.<br/>Yes, mine was the coolest.
And so, we were all eager to find<br/>the fifth doppelganger, Barney's.
Turned out it was more important<br/>to some of us than others.
We agree there's no sense in having a baby
until we've seen<br/>all five doppelgangers, right?
Of course. Stands to reason.
Okay, so, when we finally<br/>see Barney's doppelganger,
that's the universe telling us it's go time,
and that's when we'll start trying. Deal?
Deal.
OLDER TED: And then one day,<br/>a few weeks later...
Baby, were you serious about<br/>the whole fifth doppelganger thing?
I mean, having a baby is a pretty big thing<br/>to leave up to the universe.
Yeah, I know it's crazy. It's just so much<br/>easier to let the universe decide.
- Why do you ask?<br/>- Boom! Universed!
Oh, my God! Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
That could easily be Barney<br/>pulling some scam to meet chicks.
I'm one step ahead of you.
Go for Barney.
Barney, hey, it's Marshall.<br/>So, you are at work?
You're not, I don't know, driving a cab,<br/>wearing a wig?
Yes, I'm at work.
That's the sound of my stapler.<br/>That's the sound of my three-hole punch.
And this is the sound of me filing
my corporate guidelines<br/>on sexual harassment.
What is up? Gotta go, Big Chief.
Barney's at work.
That was the fifth doppelganger.
(SIGHING)
Marshall Eriksen, put a baby in my belly.
I can't wait to tell the gang. This is one of<br/>those moments you dream about.
"Guys, Lily and I
"are having unprotected sex."<br/>Ooh, I just got the chills.
- We're not gonna say anything.<br/>- What? Why?
Marshall, if we tell them,<br/>we're basically inviting them
into the most private,<br/>intimate moment of our lives.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
- You guys banging?<br/>- (BOTH SCREAMING)
Keep going. I'm not even here.
But just for the record,<br/>having a baby, huge mistake.
Now show me what you got.
- Uncle Teddy's here!<br/>- (BOTH SCREAMING)
Quick question. How are you guys<br/>gonna handle the whole Santa thing?
I'm thinking, just be honest.<br/>(CHUCKLES) Oh, hell. I'll dress up.
- "This just in"<br/>- (BOTH SCREAMING)
Is what Marshall Eriksen is about to say<br/>to his wife
as he attempts to impregnate her.
Chopper 12 is live on the scene<br/>with Baby Watch: 2010.
(CHOPPER BLADES WHIRRING)
Okay, fine.<br/>I won't tell anybody about the baby thing.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey.
Guys, we saw the fifth doppelganger!
- (GASPING) Amazing!<br/>- Whoa! That is awesome!
Ooh! Freaky. A brunette Barney.
I know. Say what you will about the guy,<br/>but Barney seems right as a blond.
Well, that's true.<br/>Not every dude can pull off that blond look.
- I don't know about that.<br/>- What?
That summer I was lifeguarding<br/>at the Chagrin Falls Country Club,
I was lathering a little lemon juice<br/>into the old mop,
playing with some natural highlights.
Let's just say<br/>there were a few senior citizens
who pretended to drown on my watch.
And sadly, one who did.
Anyway, I'd look good blond.
MARSHALL: Okay, people,<br/>we're in a delicate
but very, very promising situation here.
LILY: If we play the next 30 seconds right,<br/>Ted will dye his hair blond.
ROBIN: Guys, this is mean. We can't...<br/>Whoa! Just pictured it. How do we do this?
TED: What are we all thinking about?<br/>Nachos?
MARSHALL: Ted Mosby responds<br/>to one thing above all else.
TED: I don't know.<br/>I'm still kind of full from lunch.
MARSHALL: A bunch of people<br/>emphatically telling him
not to do something. Follow my lead.
TED: Screw it. I could eat.
Yes, we'd all like some nachos.
I love you, buddy, but there is absolutely<br/>no way that you could pull off blond.
Yeah, it just wouldn't look right.
Yeah. Seriously, Ted, don't go blond.
I'm going blond.
- No.<br/>- No way.
That is not the outcome<br/>we were hoping for.
OLDER TED: Now, kids, Robin and Don<br/>were becoming such a great team,
both off and on the air,
that Local Channel 12 started asking<br/>them to guest-host
some of their other top-notch programs.
(SINGING) Monty and Moo-Moo<br/>are laughing and learning with you
- Moo-Moo<br/>- Moo-Moo
Moo!
So, that's why Monty and I vowed never<br/>to do drugs, because drugs are bad.
Right, Monty?
Well, sure. Man-made, chemical stuff.
But things that grow in nature,<br/>they're okay to try, like, once or twice.
Not looking for gray areas here, Monty.
I don't think it's right to lie<br/>to the kids, Moo-Moo.
So, what are you saying?
I've experimented with drugs.
(GASPING)
OLDER TED: Fun fact, highest rated<br/>Monty and Moo-Moo episode ever.
ROBIN: Mmm.
Mmm. What was that for?
Before I met you,<br/>I'd given up on everything,
relationships, career, pants.
But you made me wanna try again.<br/>I love you for that.
Oh.
Ooh! Oh, I see. Mmm.
(DON CHUCKLING)
Hi. Hey. Hi.
Sorry, you don't know me,<br/>but I just wanted to say thank you.
You're actually<br/>a very important person in my life.
Important? More like legendary.<br/>Marshall, it's me, Barney.
OLDER TED: Oddly enough,<br/>this would rank as only
the second biggest surprise of the day.
Wow, this is just very sudden.
Sure, I can get you an answer<br/>by tomorrow. Okay. Thanks.
(SIGHS)
Ted, something big has just happened and<br/>you're the most sensible person I know.
I need to talk to you right now.
- You know what, it can wait.<br/>- No, go ahead. I'm listening.
Okay, well,<br/>the executive producer from WNKW
happened to see our show<br/>the other morning and loved me.
(SIGHS) They offered me the lead anchor<br/>job starting next week.
- Wow! That's great!<br/>- It is great. But here's the catch.
WNKW is in...
(DRYER WHIRRING)
Helen, kill the dryer!
(WHIRRING STOPS)
Is in Chicago.
But you were the fifth doppelganger.<br/>How can you be you?
I called you, Barney.<br/>We had a whole conversation.
Ah! Yes. I know what happened.
See, people at work have<br/>this very strange expectation
that I, well, work. (SCOFFS) I know. I know.
BARNEY: So to make my colleagues think<br/>I'm busting my hump
when I'm really out humping busty chicks,<br/>I decided to record a special message.
(BARNEY ON VOICEMAIL)<br/>What is up? Gotta go, Big Chief.
How can it be a recording?
You called me "Big Chief,"<br/>my special workplace nickname.
Oh, buddy.
Hey, hey, come on, Big Chief.
Don't. Just don't.
Why does this have to happen now?
I mean, just when things are going<br/>so great with Don.
(SIGHING) It's the never-ending battle<br/>of my life. Career versus romance.
(LAUGHS) "Never-ending battle"?<br/>Career's been trouncing romance for years.
It's like the Globetrotters versus<br/>the Generals.
Career's sinking hook shots<br/>from half court.
Romance is just<br/>a bunch of slow, white guys
who couldn't make it in the Italian league.
Ted, I'm lost. What should I do?
Okay, you seriously need to talk<br/>to Don about this.
I'm just too confused to put this on Don.
I need to leave him out of it<br/>until I figure out what I want.
- That makes sense.<br/>- Yeah.
And I'm sorry I can't give you better advice<br/>on this. The truth is,
it's impossible for me to be objective<br/>about you moving away.
Mmm.
Did you get a manicure?
- No, I didn't get a...<br/>- He sure did.
Flo!
- Why are you brunette and driving a cab?<br/>- Oh! That.
You know how it's my dream to have sex<br/>with at least one woman
- from every country on the planet?<br/>- Sure.
Wow. You're doing surprisingly well<br/>in the Baltics.
Mmm-hmm.
So I figured, what's the quickest way to<br/>get around the world in 180 lays?
Lease a cab and wait outside<br/>the UN building for hot foreign chicks.
BARNEY: It was the perfect plan.
There was only one small detail<br/>I didn't take into account.
- Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers?<br/>- Chicks do not want to bang cab drivers.
- And I put a lot of work into this one.<br/>- I can't believe this.
Now I gotta tell Lily<br/>the fifth doppelganger is a fake.
So, what does she care?
Lily decided that once<br/>we spotted your doppelganger,
- we'd start trying to have kids.<br/>- Kids! No! Uh-uh!
The rule is, no kids until you're at least 45.<br/>Do you ever read my blog?
It's gotten a lot better.
I'm ready to be a dad, you know?
But Lily needs some sign<br/>from the universe.
And now it could be years.
I'm sorry, buddy.
That'll be 37.50.
OLDER TED: So, that night, Marshall went<br/>home to break the bad news to Lily.
The universe has spoken.<br/>Marshall Eriksen, let's make a baby.
I...
Okay.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)
You... Hang on, hang on, hang on.
I heard you were doing this,<br/>so I wrote down some stuff.
"Hey, I'm planning a white wedding.
"Tell me, Billy Idol,<br/>is it a nice day for that?"
Some other Billy Idol ones.
"If anyone's looking for<br/>the real Slim Shady, he's right here."
That one's only okay.<br/>Robin, why aren't you getting in on this?
Okay, first of all,<br/>I'm getting tons of compliments.
Second of all, tell him.
- He's not getting tons of compliments.<br/>- No, the other thing.
ROBIN: Oh.
I might move to Chicago next week.
- Hey, baby.<br/>- Mmm-hmm?
Not for nothing or nothing,<br/>but we'd still be doing this
even if we hadn't seen<br/>Doppelganger Barney, right?
Oh, but we did see him, which means<br/>the universe, in all its infinite wisdom,
is telling you to stick me<br/>and stick me real good.
I can't.<br/>I can't, in good conscience, stick you.
(LILY SIGHING)
- I know what's bothering you.<br/>- Really?
The cabbie just didn't look enough<br/>like Barney.
Well, that's just not true.
No! Time out. This is a group decision.
You can't just move to Chicago,<br/>unless we all say it's okay.
Barney, I think this has to be Robin's...
Stay out of this, Brigitte Nielsen<br/>or Dolph Lundgren from Rocky IV.
We need Marshall and Lily.
That cabbie was, like,<br/>a foot shorter than Barney.
He was the exact same size.
And you know what? I think he was Asian.
Yeah, that guy was like<br/>a tiny, graying Asian man,
with a soul patch and a potbelly.
Have you completely forgotten<br/>what Barney looks like?
- You guys banging?<br/>- (BOTH SCREAMING)
Why are you in our bedroom?
(BOTH SCREAMING)
Why are you in our bedroom?
(BOTH SCREAMING)
Why is Ellen DeGeneres in our bedroom?
- (ROBIN AND BARNEY GIGGLE)<br/>- Hey! This is working.
Wait a minute. Candles, flowers.
Oh! I guess Marshall "forgot" to tell you.<br/>The fifth doppelganger was me.
What, wait, and you knew about this?<br/>You lied to me?
By omission. And it's only because
this whole "leave it to the universe"<br/>thing of yours is insane, Lily.
- Baby, you knew I needed to decide if we...<br/>- Lily, we need to be
in control of our own destinies.
Guys! Guys! We're forgetting<br/>what's really important here.
Ted's blond.
(ALL GIGGLE)
Guys, I am pulling this off.
Now, Robin has something important<br/>to tell you.
- He's not pulling it off.<br/>- No, the other thing.
- He got a manicure.<br/>- The other thing.
I got a job offer in Chicago.
Whoa!
That's why we all came down here,
to try and talk Robin out of<br/>making a huge...
Actually, I've already made a decision.
(SIGHS) Guys, I gotta take it.
I can't believe we're losing Robin.
LILY: Guys, this might be<br/>the depression talking,
but is Ted's hair starting to look<br/>kind of good?
MARSHALL: Thank God.<br/>I thought I was the only one.
BARNEY: He looks like<br/>a freaking movie star.
And by the way, this was a huge mistake.
- I'm changing my hair back.<br/>- Smart. Very smart.
- Told you.<br/>- Not at all awesome.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
So, I just got off the phone with Chicago.
Yes, I have made a decision. Um...
I appreciate the offer,<br/>but I can't take the job. Thanks.
- I'm staying.<br/>- Damn straight!
(ALL CHEERING)
Hey, Lily. Tell me something.
You saw actual Barney driving that cab,
and you thought it was<br/>a petite, potbellied Asian man.
I know. Weird, right?
It's not weird.
It means you're not ready.<br/>And I'm sorry that I tried to rush things.
Our baby can wait for<br/>the real Doppelganger Barney.
(SIGHS) Oh.
(IN PUPPET VOICE) Hey, Moo-Moo.
Monty made you thin crust pizza,<br/>just the way you like it.
ROBIN: Mmm.
You okay?
Robin, you're not gonna believe this.
I got offered the lead anchor job<br/>at WNKW in Chicago.
Oh!
Um...
What'd you say?
I said yes.
I've been waiting years for a shot like this.<br/>I was hoping you'd understand.
Barney?
(IN ESTONIAN ACCENT)<br/>I am simple street performer from Estonia.
Who is this Barney?
Oh, he's just this guy we know<br/>who has, like, a really lame blog.
I hear it's getting better.<br/>I mean, what is "blog"?
It's just something that was cool,<br/>like, eight years ago.
Still cool. Still sounds pretty cool, man.
- What's your name?<br/>- Kristof.
Kristof what?
Kristof Doppelganger.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.
You're gonna go with the last name<br/>"Doppelganger"?
- That's my name, man.<br/>- Bro.
Robin, wait. Please try to understand.
Look, I gotta get out of here.
Put yourself in my shoes.
I mean, can you imagine what it's like<br/>to have the phone ring
and it's your dream job on the other end?
Yes. I can.
Good luck in Chicago, Don.
Barney, why are you doing this?
Wait a minute.
Could it be that Barney Stinson<br/>actually wants us to have kids?
Who is this Barney?<br/>Take American chill pill.
Well, let me tell you about him.
He talks a big game about
how no one should ever have kids<br/>before they're at least 45.
I would be interested in reading<br/>some of these opinions in blog form.
But I think I know what happened.
Yesterday, Barney thought he had to say<br/>goodbye to someone he truly loves.
And it got him thinking.
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing<br/>if a baby joined our little group.
- Babies can be cute.<br/>- Mmm.
And someday, he's gonna make<br/>the best uncle in the world.
Because this Barney, he's family to us.
Excuse me.
I heard you're from Estonia. So am I.
Excuse me one moment.
Estonia would close out the Baltics!
And I am street performer, like you.
(BARNEY GASPING)
Hey.
- (CRYING) Say yes to this.<br/>- Okay.
Can I move back in?
Yes.
But, Ted, am I just the biggest idiot<br/>in the world?
Look, think about all of us<br/>five years ago, when we first met you.
TED: Marshall and Lily were just<br/>boyfriend and girlfriend.
Now they're married<br/>and thinking about kids.
And Barney? Barney was never<br/>gonna commit to anyone, ever.
And last year, he fell in love.
And me, I was chasing<br/>some girl I was convinced was the one.
Now she's one of my closest friends.
And you? Five years ago, you never<br/>would've chosen love over your career.
But today, you did.
- Looks like I'm getting dumber.<br/>- No, just more courageous.
Look, we've all been searching for<br/>the five doppelgangers, right?
Mmm-hmm.
But eventually, over time,<br/>we all become our own doppelgangers.
You know, these completely different<br/>people who just happen to look like us.
Five Years Ago Robin?<br/>That girl, she was pretty great.
But Doppelganger Robin? She's amazing.
We've, um...
- We've had a lot to drink.<br/>- I don't care.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
What?
Oh!
- I forgot. I'm blond. I have blond hair.<br/>- You're blond.
OLDER TED: And that's the story
of how dyeing my hair blond<br/>kept us from doing something
we both would have regretted that night.
Kids, the universe is funny.
Oh, my God.
- Yes! You're here!<br/>- I don't understand...
This is fantastic!
Baby, simmer. Your husband's right here.<br/>At least attempt to hide it.
Guys, follow me.
Guys, look! The fifth doppelganger!
- Uh, Lily?<br/>- That dude looks...
MARSHALL: Guys, go with it.
OLDER TED: Kids, you can ask the universe<br/>for signs all you want.
- It's uncanny.<br/>- Right?
- Looks just like Barney.<br/>- Amazing.
It's like looking in the mirror.
OLDER TED: But ultimately,<br/>we only see what we wanna see,
when we're ready to see it.
So, does this mean...
Marshall Eriksen, put a baby in my belly.
(LIFESIZEPLAYING)
All for love we become
Larger than lifesize, wondersome
Great in the eyes of someone

[<div class="full-script">Kids, there are two<br/>big days in any love story:
The day you meet<br/>the girl of your dreams,
and the day you marry her.
Nice! Where'd you get this?
Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit.
Beer be with you.
And also with you.
Mmm.
Man, this is what<br/>church has been missing.
Dude, you fixed church.
Yeah. You're welcome, God.
Nervous?
What? No. I'm just<br/>hoping it doesn't rain.
Why? Do I look nervous?
Look at your beer, dude.
You always do that<br/>when you're nervous.
It's a sad day in New York, Ted.
A sad day, indeed.
Do you know what I saw<br/>on my way in here?
A girl...
In a sweater.
And you know what that means.
The season of exposed skin is over.
Exactly.
Gone are the tank tops, Ted.
Gone are the cute little skirts.
Gone are the sun dresses.
The sun dresses, Ted!
I don't think
I can make it another eight<br/>months with no sun dresses.
Barney, I really...<br/>I have to grade these papers.
I'm sorry. I'll let you work.
But first,
a riddle:
What piece of women's attire
most stokes a man's desire?
A sun dress.
Correct.
What lightweight outfit,
pink or white,
makes the front of my slacks<br/>abnormally tight?
I really have to get this done.
Of course, of course.
Thank you.
"Sun dress", by the way.
Hey!
What are you nervous about?<br/>Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me.
What flowing cotton frock...
Okay, I'll tell you. Just...
There's a...
There's a girl
sitting at the bar.
- Oh.<br/>- Don't look!
I want to see a pretty girl.
Okay, you can look.<br/>Just, just, just be cool for once.
I'll be cool.
Ah, Ted.
You got your beer label<br/>in a bunch over nothing.
Listen to your uncle Barney.
You have no reason to be nervous.
None whatsoever.
And I'm going to tell<br/>you why in one word.
And what's that word?
- Dibs!<br/>- What...
You can't call dibs on a girl
I've been sitting here<br/>thinking about maybe talking to
eventually at some point.
You never called dibs.
Dibs were implied.
- Implied dibs?<br/>- Yeah.
Ted, you are spitting on the grave
of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib.
It was 1652...
The SS Dibs was lost at sea...
Look, I don't have time<br/>for a fake history lesson,
so I'll keep this simple.
You go over there<br/>and talk to that girl,
I will see you in court.
And who's gonna represent you?<br/>Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!
Damn it.
Where is Marshall anyway?
Uncle Marshall and aunt Lily
had recently decided
to take a swing at starting a family.
Tonight was their first at-bat.
Okay, uh, I'm almost ready to leave.
Let's just go through the checklist.<br/>Candles?
Check.
Music to set the mood?
Check.
Music for when<br/>we're actually doing it?
Check.
You know what?
To hell with your dibs.
I'm going over there right now<br/>and talking to her.
Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest.
Fall in love with her. Get married.
Just know this:
When I step up to make my toast
as your best man...
Actually, Marshall<br/>would probably be...
As your best man...
Ladies and gentlemen...
I...
Had dibs.
- No!<br/>- What?
Tell me this isn't true.
I had implied dibs.
Oh!
You know,
you've humiliated me!
I had no idea. You have to know that.
Shh, shh.
You're the victim here. We both are.
Let's get out of here.
Or, you know, we could<br/>just do it right here.
We could just do it right here.
Fine.
Have at it.
Exercise your dibs.
She's got her shields up anyway.<br/>She's reading a book.
Yeah.
At a bar.
That book might as well be called,
are you there, Barney?<br/>It's Me, Horny.
That is not
what "shields up" looks like.
That is what "shields up" looks like.
Move.
God!
Hey. 'Sup, dudes?
Fries?
Oh, good God, woman.<br/>You're a disgrace.
No fries for this guy.
Robin,
seriously, I love you, but it's like
you have squiggly cartoon odor lines
coming off of you right now.
You know what, Barney?
Just cut her some slack, okay?
She just went through a breakup.
With hygiene?
No, with Don.
A few months earlier...
Here, have some tea.
Thanks.
Robin, I am here for you.
Whatever you need.
Okay, um, about that.
Ted, listen.
I know myself pretty well.
And, um, some time<br/>over the next few months,
I'm going to want to sleep with you.
And when that happens,
you have to try to say no.
Try?
I will absolutely say no.
Our friendship is too important.
Oh.
Okay, you know,<br/>maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Um...
I will come at you<br/>with everything I've got.
I will stalk you
like the lioness stalks the gazelle:
careful, patient, deadly.
And if you let your guard down
for so much as a second,
as sure as you were born,
I will hump your brains out.
Okay, I'm ready to have sex now.
It was a tough summer,
but I think our girl's<br/>been a real trooper.
She's...
Is this a Cheeto?
No, we ran out of Cheetos last week.
Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.
Oh, you're exquisite.
You must let me paint you.
Hey Robin, what do you think?
The girl sitting at the bar.
Shields up?
Mmm, totes, toots.<br/>She's here on a date.
She brought the book<br/>because she got here early,
and she also wants to impress<br/>the guy she's meeting.
Girls like to come across all<br/>classy and smart, you know?
This? What you're doing right now?
I'm getting a "de-rection."
Hey! How'd it go?<br/>You pregnant yet?
Nope!
Okay, so, here's what happened.
I was at home, waiting for Marshall.
Hey! How was your day?
Don't answer. No time.
Um, bedroom. No, no. No time.
Floor. No, no time.
Against this wall!
Marshall, whoa! Wait.
A big package just arrived.
Yeah, it did.
No, no.
It's a real package from your dad.
Well, that's a little weird,<br/>but yeah, it is.
Marshall, look!
A bassinet? Oh, my...
He must've made it<br/>in his wood shop.
Wasn't that sweet of him?
Lil?
Isn't that sweet?
Lily?
You told your dad<br/>we're trying to have a baby?
Of course I did.<br/>I tell my dad everything.
My dad is my best friend.
Oh!
Lily, we have been looking forward
to this magical, special night<br/>for two weeks now.
And, sweetie, during that time,<br/>I have been, um...
How do I put this delicately?
Saving all my love for you.
I have read 11 books<br/>on conception.
I have cut out
alcohol, caffeine and sugar.
I take my temperature every hour.
But good for you<br/>for not playing with yourself.
I feel you, buddy.
Ah, no. Ah.<br/>Don't even touch me, dude.
It's been, like... It's been two weeks.
I'm, like, a light breeze away<br/>from having a big problem.
Seriously.
Okay, I'm better now.
Okay, Barney.
What's this going to cost me?
Excuse me?
Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.
Two... hundred...
And fifty thousand dollars.
20 bucks.
But I...
Can I go smell her first?
- No.<br/>- Fine.
All right.
Wish me luck.
Now kids, remember how I told you
about a girl named Cindy?
How I went on one date<br/>with her and it ended...
Get out.
Badly? Well...
- How are you?<br/>- Good.
What the hell are you doing?
That girl she's talking to?
I dated her.
Oh, that sucks!
And dibs.
So you went on one date<br/>with one of her friends.
It's not necessarily a big deal.
I mean, did it end on bad terms?
Um...
Oh, hi Cindy.
Oh, hi Cindy.
Yikes.
Well, I guess you just got to move on.
I mean, it's not like you have a shot
with Ready McGee over there, right?
Ted?
Then I remembered.
Cindy had a roommate.
A roommate<br/>I only caught a glimpse of...
But a roommate who,
by every indication,<br/>was something very special.
Was it possible?
Could this be the girl<br/>attached to that ankle?
I got to see her ankles.
You're one of those?
God, I swear, one in five guys...
Lily!
We kind of had a plan tonight,<br/>remember?
Candles? Banjo?
Who else did you tell?<br/>Did you tell anyone at the office?
Um...
Shannon?
Start the music.
Can you dig it?!
Take it to the hole, Eriksen!
Sink that putt, big fuzz!
Put a pillow under her lower back.
It helps facilitate conception, bro!
I may have mentioned it in passing
to a couple of colleagues at work.
I'm sorry about that,<br/>but you know what?
I got to be able to tell my dad.
Your dad is the last person<br/>you should tell!
The man is too involved in our lives!
It's like, every time the phone rings...
Hello.
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.
I noticed you hadn't changed<br/>your last name yet.
No, I'm gonna...
So, don't worry. I called the DMV,
I called your Amex, I got<br/>that process started for you.
Hello.
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.
I understand
you and Marshall have been fighting.
Well, let me tell you what works<br/>for me and the missus.
Frilly French undies<br/>and a box of wine.
Hello.
You might want to try<br/>pickles on that sandwich.
Pickles would have helped<br/>that sandwich!
The man has no boundaries.
And I just can't procreate<br/>under these conditions!
Yeah, well, you know what?
I've already told him,<br/>so the damage is done.
So, call him and tell him<br/>we decided not to have a baby.
Okay, so you just...
You want me to give my dad a stroke?
Only if you want to give this a stroke.
That's ridiculous.
Lily, there is no way<br/>that I would ever...
Okay, everyone needs
to shut up so that I can think!
Uh-oh. They're talking to a guy now.
What kind of guy?<br/>A cheesy guy or a cool guy?
Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.
Oh, man!
That guy is cool.
His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.
Well, that guy is cheesy,
and if you think he's not cheesy,
then you're cheesy, too,<br/>and now I want something cheesy.
Who's feeling nachos?
Oh, look at you, Robin.
You're jealous.
Jealous?
Yeah, jealous,
because she's got it,<br/>and you've lost it.
I have not lost it.
You lost it.
I still have it.
I know exactly where it is,
and I can go get it whenever I want.
Robin, girls are like cartons of milk.
Each one has a hotness<br/>expiration date,
and you've hit yours.
I'm not saying the occasional<br/>guy won't still open the fridge,
pick you up, give a sniff,<br/>shrug and take a sip anyway.
But it's all downhill from here.
I don't have to take this.
But I do have to take this.
Okay, so you just want me
to call my dad and tell him
that we're not having a baby?
That's about the size of it.
Okay, out of curiosity,
when do we tell him<br/>about the baby?
We'll tell him about the baby
when there's a baby<br/>to tell him about.
So, he just gets no notice?
He just walks into his boss's office,
and says, "I just had a grandson.
I'm gonna be out for three months."
Out for three months?
Yeah.
He and my mom are coming
to live with us when the baby's born.
We talked about this.
No, we didn't.
I meant, me and my dad.
You know what, Marshall?
Why don't you have a baby<br/>with your dad?
Oh, okay, Lily.
Why don't you have a baby<br/>with your butt?
What?
I can't think straight!
Why do you have to wear that shirt?
This is not how I thought<br/>this night was going to go!
Ted?
Oh, God, this sucks!<br/>Do you think she saw me?
Hi, Ted!
Yeah, she definitely saw you.
Can I see you for a minute...<br/>In private?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I mean, how could that not be fun?
If I don't come back,<br/>tell my mom I love her.
Okay, will do. And dibs.
Barney, am I crazy?
Marshall talks to his dad<br/>way too much, right?
Oh, you don't want<br/>my opinion on that.
Why not?
If I had my dad's number,
I would never not be<br/>on the phone with him.
Wow, that was really...
Whoa, a hottie with a body!
Boing...!
Brief.
No. Lily, look.
You saucy little minx.
You sundressed up.
Hi.
14 seconds!
14 seconds, and already
some dingdong is stepping up,
thinking he can get<br/>some of this broke off.
Oh!
I... still... got... it.
All right, buddy, you proved my point.<br/>Now scram.
Nice belt, by the way.
Hey.
Wow.
Robin, you do look super hot.
Oh, do I?
Yeah, you do.
Thanks.
I braced<br/>myself for what was next:
Rage, fury, a possible shanking.
Thank you, Ted.
After things didn't work out with us,
I got really sad for a while.
But then I realized,
you're not what I wanted, Ted,<br/>and I'm not what you wanted.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
I feel like I should<br/>make it up to you somehow.
You know, buy you a beer<br/>or Yankees tickets, or...
Or set me up with one of your friends.
No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.
- No, it wouldn't.<br/>- It wouldn't, would it?
Any one of those three.
Whichever's easiest and right nearby.
And not the beer.
I should get back.
Totally.
Come say good-bye<br/>before you leave.
Say good-bye before you leave?
Her words exactly.
Dude, you are so in.
That is so awesome.
A high five doesn't even cut it.
High six!
She didn't see us high-six, did she?
No. Good. That was pretty lame.
Yeah, let's never do that again.
Marshall?
What? Lily, what?
Are there more members
of my family that you<br/>want to crap all over?
- Here's the thing.<br/>- I'm sorry. Hold on.
Just...
It's my dad.
Lily, it's my dad, okay?
I love him, and if he calls me,<br/>I'm gonna answer the phone!
Hey, dad.
Hey, hey. I know it's late,<br/>but I just had to call.
- How'd it go?<br/>- Dad, this is...
Did you do everything the books say?
Did you put the pillow<br/>under her back?
Dad, I'm in the middle<br/>of something right now.
Did it feel like a boy? Huh?
You can tell.
He's insane.
My dad is insane.
I'm so sorry, Lily.
He's just...
He's so, um...
Enthusiastic.
It's ridiculous, you know?
Like, who's like that?
You.
You're like that.
You and your dad both care so much.
It's... it's why women fall in love
with the Eriksen men to begin with.
But right now, it's a lot of pressure.
Baby, I'm not trying to<br/>pressure you one bit.
What if I can't have a baby?
That could happen.
I could totally let you down.
Has that thought<br/>not occurred to you?
Not even for one second.
Not having a baby would suck,
but the idea of you letting me down...
That's impossible.
That would be like aliens landing.
That's a bad example,<br/>because that could happen.
It probably already has.
I saw this, uh, episode...
All right.
I'm doing this.
I am going over there.
Wish me luck.
Kids, nothing in this<br/>life quite compares to the sweet,
terrifying exhilaration<br/>of making your move.
When you just put it all<br/>on the line and go for it.
And that night, by golly,
Cindy went for it.
So no, that girl wasn't your mother.
She ended up being<br/>someone else's mother.
In fact, they both did.
Like I said,
she's here on a date.
So that was not<br/>the day I met your mother.
The day I met your mother<br/>was the day of a wedding.
Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.
Dude, it's just a wedding toast.
I know. I just... I want<br/>it to be great, you know?
I want this whole day to be great.
It will be.
Best man?
You're being summoned.
Geez, what now?
Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's...
Okay, and it's raining.
Yeah. You were saying?
You didn't happen to bring<br/>an umbrella, did you?
No. I didn't bring an umbrella.
I mean, everyone told us that<br/>it might take a while, but...
We thought we might be<br/>the exception to the rule.
Anyways, we're getting<br/>back on that horse.
I mean, feeling good<br/>about the future.
Obviously, this goes without saying,
but you won't tell Lily<br/>about any of this, right?
No! Of course! Absolutely!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">So, this chick and I are going at it<br/>behind the Central Park Zoo.
The bonobo chimps<br/>start giving us a standing "O."
And just when I'm about to give her<br/>the same thing... what up...
l-l...
I can't. I just... I can't.
Guys, I know you count<br/>the minutes...
until you can escape from your humdrum lives<br/>by hearing how awesome mine is.
And I love doing that for you.
But I just can't tonight.
- What's wrong?<br/>- I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay. Hey, you guys<br/>see Deadliest Catch last night?
Did I ever!
All right!<br/>I'll tell you.
My mother is selling<br/>the house I grew up in.
All of my childhood memories gone...<br/>just like that.
That sucks.<br/>I've been there, buddy.
What are you talking about? Your mother<br/>still lives in the house you grew up in.
With her new<br/>hippie husband Clint.
The comfort of home is a little ruined<br/>when someone turns your old room...
into what I'm pretty sure<br/>is a tantric sex temple.
With all the bamboo,<br/>pot smoke and '60s music...
it's like my old G. I. Joes<br/>are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.
Anyway, I need you guys...
to come out to Staten Island on Saturday<br/>and help box everything up.
You expect us<br/>to spend a whole day...
packing up your mom's house?
No, of course not.<br/>It's a two-day job.
- Uh, pass.<br/>- Same.
Unsubscribe.
You guys are adorable.
You seriously believe that I,<br/>Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this?
- I got the queen to give me a fist bump.<br/>- No one believes that story.
You may be able to talk the brain surgeons<br/>you pick up into doing whatever you want...
but it's not gonna work on us.
Mmm.
How did he do that?
So there we were,<br/>helping Barney pack up his childhood home.
Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing's<br/>way too big to fit in that box.
- Yeah, that's what your mom said.<br/>- How dare you!
No, she actually said that.
Oh, dear. I thought I told you<br/>that's just not gonna fit in there.
Oh.
Someone order something<br/>tall, dark and awesome?
- Hey.<br/>- Bro!
How you doin'?
- Hey.<br/>- Oh, my goodness.
- Mama.<br/>- Look at my two sons.
So big and strong and handsome.
- Uh, Mom.<br/>- Stop.
And how is my delicious little grandson?
- Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?<br/>- Check it.
- Huh? Oh!<br/>- Ah!
How cute is that, right?
When was the last time you saw...
a diaper poking out of<br/>a Dolce &amp; Gabbana suit?
Tuesday, at work.
Some of the senior partners<br/>are really getting up there.
So, Ted, yesterday at work...
I totally talked you up to that<br/>super-hot make-up girl Liz.
Oh, yeah? What'd you say?
Oh, you know, how funny you are.
- Guilty.<br/>- Handsome.
Who, me?
Incredible lover.
- Really?<br/>- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I was all, like...
he knows a woman's body better<br/>than she knows her own.
Endless waves of pleasure...
just cresting and breaking<br/>for hours and hours, blah, blah, blah.
Orgasms so intense<br/>you just black out.
All that stuff.
Robin, how can I possibly<br/>live up to that review?
What? You know what<br/>you're doing down there.
Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it.<br/>We know this.
But that is not the point.
You broke the first rule of<br/>setting people up... undersell.
It's like if someone's<br/>never seen The Karate Kid...
you don't say,<br/>"It's the greatest movie ever."
You say, "Uh, it's pretty good."
And then they see it,<br/>and it blows their freakin' mind.
'Cause Cobra Kai Sensei's<br/>all, like, "Sweep the leg!"
And Daniel-san's all, like,<br/>"Ahh-ahh-ahh."
Maybe I did oversell you a bit.
Thank you guys so much<br/>for helping us out with this stuff.
Oh, it gives us a rare insight<br/>into the makings of Barney Stinson.
- Hmm.<br/>- Hey, look at this.
Who was a cute little basketball player...
before he became<br/>the biggest pervert in the world?
I loved pee-wee basketball.
Well, until they<br/>kicked me off the team.
I was so awesome...
the coach asked me to quit because<br/>it wasn't fair to the other kids.
That sounds plausible.
Hey, it's true.
Tell 'em, James.
Oh, yeah. He had, like,<br/>a four-foot vertical leap.
He would hit it from the outside,<br/>hit it from the inside.
He sucked.
Coach cut him from the team, and Mom<br/>fed him that story so he'd feel better.
Oh, my God. Look at this.
My letter from<br/>the postmaster general.
I still can't believe<br/>he took the time to write this.
"Dear Barney"...
"I sincerely apologize<br/>about losing all the invitations...
you sent out to your<br/>eighth birthday party.
That's why none of your<br/>classmates showed up.
Not because you threw up when they<br/>turned the lights off at the planetarium.
Ah, no one even noticed that.
Also, Janey Masterson's mother<br/>is a whore...
and, with gin on her breath<br/>at 10:00 in the morning...
she's got some nerve<br/>kicking us out of the carpool.
Love, Postmaster General."
Thank you!
- Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?<br/>- Constantly.
I mean, she put more effort<br/>into some lies than others.
Mom, who's my dad?
All the other kids at school<br/>know who their dad is. Who's mine?
I don't know.<br/>That guy.
Uh, you've all heard about...
Did she tell you that Bob Barker<br/>was your dad too?
No, no, no.
I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby...
James Earl Jones,<br/>Meadowlark Lemon.
The list goes on.
I still can't get a straight answer<br/>about who my real dad is.
And Barney's no help. He still believes<br/>every lie that my mom told us growing up.
Not me.<br/>I caught on early.
Careful!
Michael Jackson<br/>sent me this glove for my 10th...
Damn.
Wow. Loretta really<br/>lied a lot to her kids.
Well, she's not alone.
Whenever Marshall<br/>was acting too hyper...
his mom would suddenly<br/>decide he was "sick"...
and give him cough medicine<br/>until he passed out.
I'm pretty sure that's<br/>what stunted my growth.
I hit 6'4" in the fifth grade,<br/>and then I just stopped.
And then there's the most<br/>popular parental lie in history... Santa.
Yeah, but that's a good lie.
Like when we tell Ted he'll meet<br/>the right girl and settle down.
I always find that reassuring.
- You will meet her, buddy.<br/>- Ya think so?
Yeah.
Santa's still a lie,<br/>and I'm not lying to our kids.
Baby, it's Santa.
Don't you want our kids goin' to sleep on<br/>Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope...
Don't you want our kids goin' to sleep on<br/>Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope...
their heads full of<br/>crazy cough syrup nightmares...
knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle<br/>is stuffing their stockings full of joy...
and stuffing his belly full of milk<br/>and lutefisk that they left him?
Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't<br/>get cookies in Minnesota?
Yeah, that's just what Santa<br/>needs at 3:00 a. m...
when he's battling a snowstorm<br/>over the Rockies... a sugar crash.
No, Santa needs protein.
I'm not lying to our kids.
I'm not lying to our kids.
Ah, valentines...<br/>the second base of third grade.
I always got a valentine<br/>from every single girl in my class.
Funny how all these girls have<br/>the exact same handwriting...
as the postmaster general,<br/>Mom...
and home run king<br/>"Frank" Aaron.
Yeah, schoolgirls.
The more they ignore you,<br/>pretend to hate your guts...
Iock you in the coatroom<br/>over winter break...
the more they secretly like you.
This isn't...<br/>Who's Sam Gibbs?
- No idea. Why?<br/>- Oh.
Mom addressed this<br/>and never sent it.
What's in it?
l...
Hey, it's a picture of you and me<br/>when we were little kids.
On the back,<br/>Mom wrote "Your son."
Okay, everyone, lunch is ready.
Who wants sloppy joes?
Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?
That doesn't sound familiar.
Who wants sloppy joes?
There's a picture of me and Barney<br/>in an envelope addressed to him.
And you wrote "Your son"<br/>on the back.
Oh, no, that...<br/>It says "Yourson."
For Yourson, North Dakota.
That's where we took the picture.<br/>Lovely town.
We went kayaking,<br/>and you two rescued the mayor's dog,<br/>which had wandered into the rapids.
Then Mayor Sam Gibbs asked for your pictures<br/>so the city could make statues of you both.
I guess I never sent it.<br/>That's embarrassing.
Now, how about<br/>those sloppy joes?
If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then<br/>why is our old swing set in the background?
I don't know!
I did my best as a single parent...
and it wasn't always easy.
And I'd recommend putting<br/>the coleslaw right on top of the sloppy joe.
Because it's delicious.<br/>That's why!
Can you believe her?
I know.
Forgetting to send the photo.
That poor sculptor<br/>had to work from memory.
Those statues probably<br/>look nothing like us.
Damn it, Mom!
- So, Ted.<br/>- Hmm?
You were worried that<br/>I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.
- How?<br/>- I sent her another e-mail.
"Dear Liz, I hope it didn't sound<br/>like I was trying to oversell Ted.
The truth is, he is a genuinely nice,<br/>down-to-earth guy...
and I think you two<br/>would really hit it off."
Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect.<br/>That totally takes the pressure off.
"Is he gonna rock your world<br/>in bed? No.
But he's clean, open to criticism<br/>and not into anything too weird.
He's not bad at all.
- Not bad at all."<br/>- See, now you went too far<br/>in the other direction.
"I'll be honest, the first few times<br/>aren't gonna be that great.
He's gonna say 'A re you finished? ' more<br/>times than a waiter at a busy restaurant."
Stop!
Listen to me.<br/>There is no Yourson, North Dakota.
- Mom...<br/>- And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor.
He might be one of our fathers.
He's not my dad.<br/>My dad's Bob Barker.
Barney, you've gotta stop livin'<br/>in these fairy tales that Mom told us.
Bob Barker is not your father.
Sam Gibbs might be.
But Bob Barker is absolutely,<br/>unequivocally not your father!
- I suppose you have a problem<br/>with the Easter Bunny too.<br/>- Not now.
This address isn't too far.
Are you comin' with me or not?
So we're doing this?
We're really gonna go disturb<br/>the peaceful Long Island retirement...
of the former mayor of Yourson,<br/>North Dakota, on a Sunday afternoon.
Real classy, James.<br/>Real classy.
You're just too scared<br/>to face the truth.
You are living in a dream world.
Maybe we shouldn't have<br/>brought these sloppy joes.
Hey, what's done is done.
"Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."
- Mmm.<br/>- No. Dependable.
No. Rugged. No...
Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site<br/>and copy down adjectives?
I just wanna hit<br/>that perfect middle ground.
How about we just go<br/>wildly to both extremes...
and just let them<br/>balance each other out?
"Ted Mosby is really handsome,<br/>but extremely violent...
and really rich,<br/>but lacks bladder control."
- Oh, damn.<br/>- What?
- That last bump just made me hit "send."<br/>- No, no.
Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone<br/>will get it's a joke.
No, they won't.<br/>They're gonna think...
Wait. "Everyone"?
"Really rich"?
- You ready for this?<br/>- For what?
I don't know who lives here,<br/>but it's not my dad.
Wait, wait.
Please stop.
Just give me a second.<br/>Okay?
- I thought you said that he wa...<br/>- Stop. Come on.
I know Bob Barker's not really, you know...<br/>I'm not crazy.
I just...
I needed that.
I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't<br/>always feel so great about myself growing up...
and so having a celebrity dad<br/>made me feel special.
But you're right, James.
It's time to let go of the fantasies.
It's time to grow up.
Come here.
Can I help you?
Yeah, um...
- You're Sam Gibbs?<br/>- Yes.
I'm James Stinson.
And, uh, I think you may have known<br/>my mother, Loretta Stinson...
in the '70s.
Loretta.
Yeah.<br/>Yeah, l-l-l-I knew Loretta.
My mother meant to send you this.
You're my son.
God, this must be<br/>so hard for Barney.
Yeah, but you know what?<br/>He took a big step today.
Papa!
Uh-oh.
Look at us!
It's like three of the same guy.
Oh, my God.
This explains why I was always<br/>so awesome at basketball.
Guys, I'm black.
Sorry.<br/>African-American.
No. I'm allowed to say either.
I gotta go get my camera!
That is my younger brother,<br/>Barney.
He just thought he'd meet his real dad today,<br/>and clearly he's not taking it so well.
Well, my head's<br/>kind of spinning too.
I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other<br/>for a couple of months.
You were two before<br/>I even knew you existed.
And at that point, your mother made it very clear<br/>she was gonna raise you on her own.
I felt I had to respect her wishes.
But I always wanted to meet you.
Wait, Barney and James<br/>are two years apart.
If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months,<br/>he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.
He's also quite the detective.
Don't worry. We'II, uh... We'll snap Barney<br/>out of this when he gets back.
Or, uh, we could just let him<br/>have this one.
- Are you kidding?<br/>- Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home.
He finally admitted<br/>Bob Barker's not his dad.
And then he watched James<br/>meet his real father.
It's just a lot to go through<br/>in one afternoon.
Can't we just let the guy<br/>be black for a day?
Here, Ted!<br/>Capture the moment!
I think you'd need<br/>Salvador Dali...
to capture this particular moment,<br/>but I'll give it a whirl.
Man, I thought I was<br/>a light-skinned Caucasian...
but in truth I'm a really light-skinned<br/>African-American.
Man, try to hail a cab<br/>in Manhattan.
Am I right?
Nope.<br/>No one's stoppin' for this.
These guys don't understand<br/>what I'm talkin' about.
During that afternoon...
Sam and James began to discover<br/>how much they had in common.
# When the night has come #
Mmm.
# Oh, and the land is dark #
Come on, you know this.<br/>Come on.
- # And the moon #<br/>- # The moon #
# Is the only #
# Light we'll see #
# Light we'll see<br/>Light we'll see #
- # Oh, I won't #<br/>- # No, I won't #
- # Be afraid #<br/>- Hey! Ho!
# Oh, I won't shed a tear #
# No, I won't shed no tear #
# Not as long #
# As you stand #
- # Stand by me #<br/>- # Stand by me #
There you go.<br/>Come on.
# Whenever you're in trouble #
# Won't ya stand #
# Stand by me #
- # Stand #<br/>- # Won't you stand by #
# Won't you stand by #<br/>Hey!
# Just stand ##
- Weird day.<br/>- Weird day.
Hey, look at that.<br/>Liz still wants to meet you.
- That's great!<br/>- Mm-hmm.
I guess.
Wait a minute.
You said Liz was a total 10.
Why would she wanna meet<br/>the incontinent freak show you described?
- Um...<br/>- You oversold her.
- Maybe a little.<br/>- You said she was a 10.
I did not specify on what scale.
You said she looked<br/>like a movie star.
She does.<br/>It's Robert De Niro.
But like super buff,<br/>like in Cape Fear.
Dad, look how fast I can run.
He's actually a really sweet guy...
and he's great with my son.
I have a grandson?
Uh...
His name is Eli.
He's beautiful.
Dad, you're not looking.
Eventually<br/>the strangest afternoon of our lives...
wound to a close...
and we headed back<br/>to Staten Island...
where Barney and his mom<br/>had a long-overdue heart-to-heart.
Barney, I need to talk to you.
Uh, me first.
Mom, there's something<br/>that I need to ask you...
and l... I want you<br/>to be honest with me.
Why do white people<br/>like Carrot Top?
Listen.
I always wanted to be<br/>enough for you boys.
I think that's why it always hurt...
whenever you asked<br/>about your dads...
because I was always trying so hard<br/>to be both parents for you.
But I was being selfish.
You deserve the truth,<br/>so here it is.
Sam is not your father.
Are you sure?
Yes.
He's black, dear.
But if you want, I can tell you<br/>who your father really is.
And at that moment,<br/>Barney suddenly saw his childhood...
more clearly<br/>than he ever had before.
I'm sorry, but your son can't be<br/>on the team. He's terrible.
What did Coach say, Ma?
He said you're simply too good<br/>to be on the team.
It's not fair to the other boys.<br/>But that's okay.
We can just play together<br/>in the backyard.
Why didn't anyone come?
Oh, you know what, dear?
Apparently there was a mix-up<br/>with the mail.
I just got this letter<br/>from the postmaster general.
"Dear Barney...
I sincerely apologize<br/>for losing all the invitations...
you sent out to your<br/>eighth birthday party."
- Barney.<br/>- It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.
But it's your father.
I already have a father.
And his name...
is Loretta.
Kids, your Uncle Barney<br/>grew up without a dad...
and it always<br/>made him feel incomplete.
But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the<br/>boxed-up remnants of his happy childhood...
he realized he had<br/>one hell of a mom.
# If the sky #
- # We look upon #<br/>- # Mmm-mmm-mmm #
# Should tumble and fall #
# Or the mountains #
# Should crumble #
# To the sea<br/>To the sea ##
Wait, Dad, James.
Where you goin'?<br/>That's the best part.
Can we go camping?
English - US - SDH<br/></div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in my early<br/>days of being a professor,
I had one simple goal:
give a lecture that<br/>changes someone's life.
Then one afternoon in 2010,<br/>I achieved that goal.
Unfinished.
Of all the words you could use<br/>to describe La Sagrada Familia...
Brown, pointy, weird...
The one that really seems<br/>to stick is "unfinished."
Why?
Because on June 7, 1926,<br/>the architect Antoni Gaudi...
Whose beard was also brown,<br/>pointy, weird and unfinished...
...was run over by a bus.
And so, his greatest masterpiece<br/>would remain forever...
But first,<br/>let's back up a few days.
Ted, look across the bar.
Three chicks:<br/>one hot, one kind of hot
and one who I'm assuming<br/>is really funny.
We ride!
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Got a burger coming.
Bro, I told you,
if you ever need a wingman,<br/>I'm your guy.
Yeah, I'm not going to go<br/>through that again.
Hi.
Barney Stinson.
And I'm Marshall,<br/>Barney's wingman.
Thank you for your time.
Fine. I'll have a three-way<br/>with hot and kind of hot
while Giggles works the camera.
I ride!
So, get this:
Last night, I was watching TV,<br/>and it turns out,
some random satellite channel
picks up a certain<br/>local Chicago newscast.
And now, the 11:00<br/>News with Don Frank.
Oh, man, it's<br/>bad enough
to have to go through<br/>a horrible breakup,
but then have that<br/>person pop up on your TV?
Are you okay?
Well, I'll admit, at first,<br/>I felt a little weird.
But after the initial shock,<br/>I realized something:
I've moved on.
Finished with that.
It was a peaceful<br/>moment of closure.
That's great.
- Good on you.<br/>- Yeah, thank you.
Where's the<br/>poop, Robin?
Excuse me?
When I was a kid, I<br/>had a dog named Bean.
Whenever he made the face<br/>that you're making right now,
you just knew he pooped<br/>somewhere in the house.
Where's the poop, Robin?
I don't know what you're talking<br/>about. Where's the poop, Robin?
There's no poop.<br/>Where's the poop?
Okay.
So it wasn't entirely<br/>a peaceful moment of closure.
Hey, Don, here's<br/>some breaking news:
there's a zit breaking out<br/>on your forehead.
Finished with that.
Look, I'm not proud,<br/>but Don left so quickly
that I never got the chance<br/>to have that final showdown.
So yelling at him, even on TV,<br/>felt kind of good.
And you know what?
Now I truly am over him.
That's great.<br/>Thank you.
Good on you.
Where's the<br/>poop, Robin?
Damn it!
Okay, in the process<br/>of truly getting over him,
I may have called him
and left an...<br/>indelicate voice mail.
I am gonna kill you.
I'm gonna fly to Chicago,<br/>kill you,
put your stupid face<br/>on a deep dish pizza and eat it.
And then maybe<br/>catch a Bears game.
But mostly the killing<br/>and eating your face thing.
Give me your phone.
We're deleting<br/>Don's number.
Don't worry.
I am never doing that again.
It was a one-time thing.
Prove it.
Delete contact.
There. Deleted.
Back already.
How was flying solo?
And by "solo," I mean<br/>so low that you got shot down.
Look, I didn't get shot down.
Trust me, I'll get the yes.
Barney Stinson<br/>always gets the yes.
This is all
part of the plan.
After initial contact,
I'm now in the ignoring phase.
Barney, why can't you just<br/>take a girl out to dinner
like a normal person?
Golden rule: I do not<br/>buy dinner to get the yes.
Dinner's a very<br/>intimate activity.
It requires
a level of connection<br/>and eye contact
that sex just doesn't.
Call me old-fashioned,
but I need to have sex<br/>with a girl at least three times
before I'll even consider<br/>having dinner with her.
The next day,<br/>at the university,
I had a surprise visitor.
What are you<br/>doing here?
Oh, God!
You're dating<br/>one of my students.
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Barney, I know<br/>she wears provocative sweaters,
but she's 19!
Now I'm gonna have to hear
all about it, right?
Go on, tell me every detail.
No, you pent-up old perv.
I brought you<br/>a present.
Recognize this?
It's my building.
Kids, you may remember that,<br/>a few years earlier,
I was chosen to design<br/>the new Manhattan headquarters
for Goliath National Bank.
It was the opportunity<br/>every architect dreams about.
And when the project<br/>was ultimately scrapped...
it broke my heart.
Do you remember how awesome<br/>it was to be co-workers...
Nay, bro-workers?
Wait a minute.<br/>Y-You don't mean...
Ted Mosby, it's back on.
We're gonna build<br/>your building.
This is awesome... You're<br/>designing our new headquarters.
Now, there will be<br/>voices that tell you
a hockey rink on<br/>the roof is unfeasible.
You've got to shut<br/>those voices out.
Actually, I think<br/>I'm gonna say no.
No? Are you kidding me?
But designing a building<br/>in New York City
is your lifelong dream.
I do not want<br/>to work for GNB again.
Those guys are evil.
No offense, Marshall.
Dude, none taken.
Yes, GNB is,<br/>the Empire from Star Wars.
But the Death Star's gonna<br/>get built either way.
And don't you think<br/>the architect of the Death Star
is pretty psyched to have that<br/>thing on his space resume?
I mean, yes,
his design was flawed<br/>in the sense
that a single bullet<br/>fired into a particular vent
would explode the whole thing.
For all we know,<br/>that was the contractor's fault.
But that won't happen on<br/>your watch... you know why?
Because you're Ted Mosby!
And you are gonna design<br/>the most beautiful,
ventless, Rebel-proof building<br/>in Manhattan,
with clearly marked<br/>emergency stops
for every trash compactor<br/>on the detention level.
Look, I know this is<br/>hard to understand,
but right now, I have a quiet,<br/>simple, happy little life.
And I like it that way.
I know what my answer has to be.
I can't take<br/>the job, Barney.
I'm done with that life.
No hard feelings?
Of course not.
All right.
Hey, Professor Mosby.<br/>Hey, Rachel.
And I thought that was<br/>the end of the story.
But then that night...
I'm telling you,
no architect would ever design
a giant exposed vent right over<br/>a Death Star's core reactor.
That's Space<br/>Architecture 101.
It had to be the contractor.
Barney, back me up.
Barney.
Dude, this is important.
I need another drink.
Marshall, you want anything?
No, I'm fine.
Okay, I get that he's mad at me<br/>for turning down the job,
but acting like<br/>I'm not even here?
Wait, you turned down the job?<br/>When?
This morning.
That's so weird.
Just, like, an hour ago,<br/>when we were leaving work...
So, you still think<br/>Ted's gonna take the job?
Please.
I'll get the yes.
Barney Stinson<br/>always gets the yes.
Am I wrong or is that<br/>exactly what Barney says
when he's putting the moves<br/>on a girl?
Exactly. I mean,<br/>it's almost like
he's putting the moves on you.
Yeah, more like the opposite.
He's been ignoring me all night.
Barney wants me<br/>to take the job so bad
he's putting the moves on me?
I hope that's his end game.
Actually, I don't.
I like you two together.
I don't buy it.
That's crazy, even for Barney.
Okay, well, think about it.
We've seen his moves<br/>countless times.
What does he do after<br/>he's done ignoring a girl?
Chrissy, I love<br/>your glasses.
Really?
They totally<br/>pull focus up
from that whole chin<br/>situation you got going on.
To Chrissy.
The backhanded compliment
to lower her self-esteem...<br/>a proven winner.
But Barney hasn't done...
Ted, I admire your loyalty.
You've had<br/>that hairstyle forever.
You don't care<br/>that it's out of fashion
or that it's been co-opted<br/>by the lesbian community.
You stick with it.
To Ted.
Hey, Lily!
Don't "Hey, Lily" me.
I smelled poop all the way<br/>from the hallway.
Oh, no, not this again.
Where's the poop, Robin?
Okay, I left Don<br/>another message.
"This just in"
is what I'm gonna say
when I'm stabbing you.
But that's impossible.
You deleted<br/>his number.
I tried to.
But then this thing popped up
on my phone that said,<br/>"Are you sure?"
And I wasn't sure.
I can't lie to my phone.
Oh, sweetie,<br/>I totally understand.
Delete it!
It's not that easy, okay?
You're not just<br/>deleting a number,
you're deleting<br/>a part of your life.
You know, all those
memories, all those experiences.
It's like you're admitting<br/>they're gone forever.
I know, sweetie.
I know.
Delete it!
Okay, if it's that easy,
I'm gonna delete one of<br/>your numbers from your phone,
see how you like it.
My "plezh."
If you can find<br/>a number in there
that I don't call regularly,<br/>I'll gladly delete it.
Super Kicks Karate.
No, not that one.
That's my dojo.
You have a dojo?
I took an introductory<br/>karate class.
Ops, wrong room.
Where do the grown-ups go<br/>for the real karate class?
What's the matter, lady?
You scared?
Of you? Please.
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I hated kindergarten.
All three times.
But I'm totally gonna<br/>sign up for more lessons.
How long ago<br/>did you take that class?
I don't know.
It was around the time
when everyone was going,<br/>"Wassuuuuuuup!"
How do you even remember that?
Wassuuuuuup...!
Lily, this is a number<br/>that you will never dial again.
I might.<br/>No, no.
But you keep it in your phone
because it reminds you<br/>of a version of yourself
that you could be, even if<br/>it's a version of yourself
that you'll never become.
And that's okay.
No, it's not.
Okay, you know what?
There, gone.
Your move,<br/>Scherbatsky.
I finally know<br/>what your kind goes through.
I get it now.
For the last time,<br/>I don't care how big it was,
it is not the same<br/>as giving birth.
No!
Barney's been<br/>"putting the moves" on Ted.
Oh, that sucks.
Although I like<br/>you two together.
No, he's been doing it to try<br/>to get Ted to design
the new GNB Tower.
Which moves<br/>are we talking about?
Did he do the thing where<br/>he brags on himself
in the form of a complaint?
Man, every time
I take out my business card
and women see the GNB logo,<br/>they throw themselves at me.
I miss the chase.
It sucks!
Man, the courtside<br/>Knicks seats
that are available to all<br/>upper level GNB employees
are too close to the action.
I keep getting sweat on my suit.
It sucks!
Man,
GNB's benefits package<br/>is so comprehensive
it gives me the freedom to see<br/>any doctor I want.
It sucks!
He did.
And the intense eye contact<br/>thing?
So, Ted,
would you like to split<br/>some jalapeno poppers?
Okay.
Yep.
And the thing where he<br/>establishs intimacy
through physical contact?
You know why jalapeño poppers<br/>are so good?
It's the cream cheese.
That is so true.
Yeah...
Cream cheese has<br/>a mild flav-flavor
so it... it balances out<br/>the spiciness of the jal...
the spiciness of the...
Dude!
So at any point in this
did you say, "Barney,<br/>I know what you're doing,
"and it's not going to work.
I am not taking that job"?
Well, I mean, not<br/>exactly in those...
You're loving this.
No.
You are.
You're loving the attention.
It's nice to be wanted, okay?
And, yes, this is a new vest.<br/>Thank you all for noticing.
Oh, that's right, you didn't.
Barney did!
Oh, Teddy,
you are so going<br/>to spread your legs
and design that building.
I am not that kind<br/>of architect.
So get this... Robin never<br/>deleted Don's number.
Wait...
Oh, everyone thinks<br/>it's so easy.
Give me your phone.
Let's delete<br/>one of yours.
Okay.
No problem.
If you can find a number<br/>that I don't need
or shouldn't have in here,<br/>be my guest,
but good luck.
I keep my phone tight.
Edwin.<br/>Oh, no, not that one.
That's the booker for the club<br/>that my band plays at.
You know, my all-lawyer<br/>funk band... you remember...
The Funk, the Whole Funk<br/>and Nothing but the Funk.
* Your witness lied<br/>so your case is sunk, hah! *
* I sentence you<br/>to a life of funk *
* Counselors,<br/>how do you plead? *
* Funky. *
Kick it.
You guys played one gig<br/>four years ago.
I'm deleting it.
No, no, we're gonna... we're<br/>gonna play another gig again.
Probably really soon.
It's just we all got<br/>super busy, and...
We're not going to play<br/>another gig again, are we?
Probably not, baby.
See, it's hard to hit<br/>that delete button, isn't it?
Well, it's just that without<br/>that number in my phone,
I'm just a corporate lawyer
working 60 very un-funky hours<br/>a week.
Sorry, Marshall.
But if I have to, you have to.
Okay. Your turn.
Barney, I gotta<br/>tell you something.
Oh, that reminds me.
I got you a little airplane.
It represents the spirit<br/>of adventure.
Do you like it, Ted?
Do you?
Stop it.
Stop looking at me
like I'm the only person<br/>in the world who matters.
I'm not designing the GNB Tower.
Yeah, I know.
You turned it down.
We hired someone else.
Can you believe it?
He's resorting<br/>to the oldest move in the book.
The classic, "pretend to take<br/>the offer off the table
so I'll want it more."
It's so obvious, right?
As if that's going to make me<br/>be like,
"Oh, God, I never<br/>should have said no."
It's not a move, dude.
I executed the paperwork for<br/>the new architect this morning.
Barney wasn't lying.
Oh, God, I never should<br/>have said no!
Come on, GNB didn't really<br/>hire a new architect.
This is just one<br/>of Barney's moves.
It's not a move, dude.
The senior partners<br/>were getting impatient.
I thought you didn't<br/>even want the job.
I didn't!
I don't!<br/>I don't. I don't!
- Okay, I'll do it!<br/>- What?
Ted, it's too late.
I'll design it for half
of what you're paying<br/>the other architect.
And you know I will do stuff<br/>they would never do.
Lobby stuff.
Wow, half?
Ted,
of behalf of Goliath<br/>National Bank...
Okay, it's a move.
- What?<br/>- Dude!
There is no other architect.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied.
I was being Barney's wingman,
and I never get to be<br/>the wingman.
You guys lied to me?
You're the world's<br/>worst wingman.
You know what? I'm out of here.
I can do better.<br/>Take me back.
You son of a bitch!
Look, I can't do business<br/>with people who lie to me.
We only lied to you to make you<br/>realize that you want this job.
No, I don't.
I mean, I know I said I did,
but that's only<br/>because I fell for the same
creepy, pickup artist voodoo<br/>of yours
that countless women...
236.
...before me fell for.
Wow, respect.
No... Ted...<br/>you want to do this, okay?
You're just scared<br/>of getting hurt again.
But you can't let fear<br/>steal your funk.
That is good.<br/>There is a song in there.
Excuse me.
Come on, Ted!
This is your dream.
No, it's not. Not anymore.<br/>And you know what?
Letting go of that dream was<br/>the best decision I ever made.
You guys actually think
I have some lingering itch<br/>to be an architect?
Work 20 hours<br/>a day and weekends?
To get ulcers and pull my hair<br/>out and worry and doubt myself
and then at the end of it all,
have the rug pulled out<br/>from under me?
I love being a professor, okay?
All that stupid crap<br/>they tell you
about how fulfilling<br/>teaching is?
It's all true.
I'm happy, and I'm not<br/>letting go of that.
My answer's no.
Hey, guys.
Where's the poop, Robin?
How do you do that?
You are like a bomb-sniffing<br/>dog, except with poop.
You are a poop-sniffing dog.
I think that's<br/>just called a dog.
Where's the poop, Robin?
Fine. I called Don again.
Hey, Don!<br/>It's Robin again.
Look, I am sorry<br/>for all the calls.
It's just,<br/>I saw you on the news,
and it made me a little crazy<br/>for a minute.
I guess I wasn't as<br/>over our breakup as I thought.
But I want to say,
from the bottom of my heart,
I am going to kill you.
No... No, I'm not.
I am happy for you.
And that Asian slut<br/>on your Facebook page.
She's dead, too.
I thought you<br/>deleted his number.
I did, but it turns<br/>out, I memorized it.
You can't delete contacts<br/>from your brain, Lily.
Well, you have to try.
If you ever want<br/>to have closure...
I am never going<br/>to have closure.
Okay? Closure<br/>doesn't exist.
Okay, one day, Don and I<br/>are moving in together,
and the next<br/>thing I know,
he's on a plane<br/>to Chicago.
It just... ended.
And no matter how much I try<br/>to forget that it happened,
it will have never<br/>not happened.
Don and I will always<br/>be a loose end.
We'll always be...
Unfinished.
Gaudi, to his credit,<br/>never gave up on his dream,
but that's not<br/>usually how it goes.
I mean, usually,<br/>it isn't a speeding bus
that keeps the brown, pointy,<br/>weird church from getting built.
Most of the time,<br/>it's just too difficult
or too expensive,<br/>or too scary.
It's only once you've stopped
that you realize how hard it is<br/>to start again.
So you force yourself<br/>not to want it.
But it's always there.
And until you finish it,<br/>it will always be...
* You keep on searching *
* While you're<br/>waiting for that sound *
* What you find *
* Ain't what<br/>you had in mind... *
Hey, Barney.<br/>Hey, Rachel.
Rachel, why aren't<br/>you in class?
Why aren't you in class?
Yeah, Ted.<br/>Why aren't you in class?
You son of a bitch.
I'll call Marshall.
We'll draw up the contract.
Not so fast.
I'm not that easy.
And so I made Barney<br/>break his golden rule.
I made him take me<br/>out to dinner
before I finally gave him<br/>the thing he always got.
Yes.
And even though<br/>it didn't happen right away...
And now, the 11:00<br/>News with Don Frank.
Bueno?
Who is this?
No hablo ingles.
Quien es?
I'm sorry. Is this 917-456...
I'm sorry, 465...
No, wait.
Robin finally<br/>got some closure, too.
Sorry. Wrong number.
Finished with that.
Hey, punk!
Bit of advice.
Next time you step on a<br/>kindergarten teacher's neck,
you better finish the job.
I knew this day would come.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.
Face. Huh.
That's your weirdest nickname<br/>for boobs yet.
No, Ted,
I'm really looking at her face.
Aw... That's actually really sweet.
Puffy cheeks,
smudged mascara,
slightly red nose...
That girl was just crying.
She's so sad
and defenseless.
Anyone have a condom?
Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!
That's it! You know what?
Five-minute time-out!
Corner booth! Now.
Hey, get this.
You know my friend Max from law school?
He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown,
and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over.
He wants us to come check it out.
I don't know, it could be cool.
I've never seen Woody Allen.
What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker
- and never have seen Woody Allen?<br/>- I have seen
plenty of other famous people.
Last week I saw... Maury Povich.
Kids, you know talk<br/>show host Maury Povich.
It was uncanny how often we saw this guy.
Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.
Maury Povich is everywhere.
I'm sorry, Robin, but you're
not a real New Yorker
until you've seen Woody Allen.
I am, too, a real New Yorker.
That's adorable.
You're from Canada.
I have been here for almost six years.
It's not like I just got off a boat.
A boat!
from someone who needs it more than you do.
No, you're not a real New Yorker<br/>till you've cried on the subway
and not given a damn<br/>what anyone thinks.
No, you're not a real New Yorker
until you've killed a cockroach<br/>with your bare hands.
Those rules are all stupid, okay?
I've never done any of those things.
By the end of this day,
Robin would have done all of those things.
Okay, time's up.
What are we talking about?
Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's,
and Robin thinks that we should go see him.
Why would I do that?
I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.
Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab,
we'll be there in 15 minutes.
A real New Yorker would<br/>know the subway's faster.
You just take the one,<br/>and transfer to the two-three.
Well, the bus runs more often on weekends.
Take the M-7 to the M-5.
The bus? Every time I take the bus,
there is one crazy person<br/>no one wants to sit near.
That's why I have never taken the bus.
Plus...
I can run faster than a bus.
Dude, that's, like, seven miles.
You can't do that.
- You can't beat the bus!<br/>- I can beat
a bus or a cab or a train!
Is anyone else suddenly<br/>craving green eggs and ham?
Machines are overrated, and someone<br/>needs to take them down a peg.
You're all wrong... I got a way to get<br/>there so fast, I could beat all of you,
even if I
sat down and ordered
a big, juicy steak first.
How?
Medium rare.
But that's not important right now.
Look, I know the city better<br/>than any of you guys, okay?
- Oh, my God!<br/>- Oh, wow!
All right, all right, hold on, hold on!
Let's just forget about it.
Who cares? I mean, there's no way
to find out who's right anyway.
First person there wins!
Doesn't matter how you get there!
Stay sad! I'll be back!
How I Met Your Mother 6x04 -<br/>Subway Wars
Hi. Can I see a menu, please?
No rush.
Kids, I should tell you,
Lily really needed a win that day.
When Marshall and Lily<br/>decided to have a baby,
they assumed it would happen right away.
It's gonna be positive.
Eriksen man are hella fertile.
When Uncle Morris was 16,<br/>he got his girlfriend pregnant
just by holding her hand too<br/>tight in the backseat of a car.
Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.
Negative.
As the weeks went by,
Marshall's confidence never wavered.
Then it started to mess with Lily's head.
Negative?
Well, we know it's not me.
Everything's fine.
These things take time.
Not with an Eriksen.
Something must be wrong with you.
Also, my mom hates you.
You know what?
Just to make sure,<br/>I'm gonna pee on this again.
What?
No, you wouldn't.
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Lily was so fed up<br/>with not getting anywhere,
maybe winning this race<br/>was just what she needed.
Idiot!
I'll show them.
My body can outrun any motorized vehicle.
I'm like John Henry<br/>when he beat the steam engine.

Kids, I also needed a win that day.
A couple nights earlier,<br/>your Uncle Marshall
had offhandedly mentioned<br/>a web site called...
It's this awesome site<br/>where students can go say
what they really think<br/>about their professors.
Hey, you're probably on there.
I just had to see what my<br/>students had written about me.
And it was...
...Majestic.
Until...
Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor.
That's why I didn't let it bother me.
I had nothing to prove.
Absolutely nothing.
Here's a fun fact.
See the Alberta Building over there?
- Oh. The brown one or the gray one?<br/>- That's the gray one.
Did you know
that in 18...
Hey!
Come on!
Elizabeth!
Somebody call an ambulance!
Excuse me, I've got a thing.<br/>Hey!
- That's my cab!<br/>- Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.
This is my cab...!
Downtown hospital, please.
It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse.
Take the FDR, and maybe<br/>crank up some smooth jazz.
Uh, we're required by law to take<br/>you to the nearest hospital,
which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt.
Uptown.
Oh, no.
It's my cab! This is my cab!
It's Barney.
Help me.
Robin also needed a win that day.
It had been a rough year for Robin.
First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don,
left her for another job.
Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky.
Hi! I'm Becky!
I am so excited to be your coanchor!
Yay!
Hi, Becky. My, you're perky.
Don't worry, I am not here<br/>to step on your toesies.
Oh...
You're still the star.
I made chocolate chip<br/>cookies for everybody!
Yay!
And just like that,
Becky started to eclipse Robin.
I mean, literally eclipse her.
This is my cab! Aah!
Keep it.

Sure. Stand a little more this way.
I'm scouting some talent.
Pretend we're talking<br/>about something important.
Oh, well, this...<br/>This is something important.
Um, I'm having a...<br/>A really rough time at work.

Kids, that day, I had<br/>a horrible realization.
If you can't spot the crazy<br/>person on the bus...
...It's you.
The good news is, I was halfway there,
and nothing could stop me.
Whoa!
This is crazy.
I can't believe it.
Okay, this is clearly a sign.
Let's just call it a tie.
Forget about the race.
Head back to the bar.
Absolutely.
Just like that, the race was back on.
Idiot.
Meanwhile, one subway car over...
Oh, God.
Oh, bite me!
Faster. Mush! Mush!
I need this win. I need this win.
And firing half my department<br/>freed up the money
to double my own salary.
And this chick from Boston was<br/>wicked hot in bed last night,
and I'm getting more muscular,
even though I've stopped working out,
and I've got this amazing poker group.
Actually, Barney did not need a win.
And I smell incredible. Smell me.
Just, seriously, smell me.
He did smell incredible.
Stop!
Too slow. Switch.
Sweetie?
Are you okay?
No.
I am done with this city. It wins.
I just want to move<br/>somewhere new and start over.
You've had a rough year.
But you're tough.
And I love you like crazy.
If you left, I'd have to follow you.
And Marshall would follow me.
And Ted would follow him.
The only upside is that we<br/>might get rid of Barney.
Bring it in.
What did he say?
No clue.
Hey, is that Maury Povich?
Hey! Lily.
Sorry, sweetie.
I swear I'll be a great friend
at the finish line,<br/>but the conductor just said
you're going express to Borough Hall,
which means you're screwed, sweetie.
So long, sucker.
Bring it in.
Damn it.
Hey, it's Lily. Help me.
And not a single passenger<br/>would listen to me.
I mean, am I a bad teacher?
Do I just put people to sleep?
Buddy?
Hey, buddy?
Need a hand?
The machines have won!
The machines have won.
Dude, mellow.
I can't do it. I can't run that far.
I can't outrace anything.
I... I can't...
I can't get my wife pregnant!
Wait.
Is that what this whole stupid<br/>running thing has been about?
My body has been letting me<br/>down, and I just wanted
to prove that it could still do something,
but it can't.
Dude, you've been trying for two months,
not two years. That's nothing.
Well, you should talk.
You know, you're the one who's freaking out
because you have one mediocre review
and, like, 50 great ones.
64. But whatever.
And you're designing a frickin' building.
I mean, come on, dude.
Sounds like you guys<br/>need to clear everything,
subtract the negativity,
and add some perspective.
Marshall!
Marshall, get in!
Hello.
There it is.
Where are Marshall and lily?
Who cares?
I won? I won!
No!
I can't believe I won!
How did that even happen?
Here's how it happened.
Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Gun it.
Ted is in the way. Run him over.
Running him over.
No. Lily, what the hell<br/>is the matter with you?
Nothing. I just want<br/>to win this really badly.
So badly that I just ditched my best friend
when she needed me.
Oh, baby, you were also going<br/>to run over Ted.
Why did I get so crazy about this?
Maybe for the same reason<br/>that I kept saying
that I could run seven miles.
I... I'm trying to be really,<br/>um, confident and positive
about all this, but, baby,<br/>I'm really scared
that we're not pregnant yet.
Oh, thank God.
I keep thinking there's<br/>something wrong with me.
I keep thinking there's<br/>something wrong with me.
It's only been two months.
We are crazy.
We're totally crazy.
This is the last time
it's ever going to be just the two of us.
Shouldn't we be enjoying that?
We gotta go back to Paris.
And take ballroom dancing.
And really learn how to ski.
Not just up and get faced in the lodge.
And see Coney Island.<br/>I've still never been.
See, we have a whole<br/>bucket list of things to do
before we start having kids.
Oh, a cradle list.
I'm...
So glad we're trying, and I'm<br/>going to be really excited
for when it happens, but this isn't a race.
This isn't a race.
Ranjit, screw Gregor's.
Let's go to Coney Island.
Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.
As for how Robin beat me and Barney,
to this day, your uncle<br/>Barney won't admit it...
But here's what I saw:
I saw Barney notice Robin's face...
And maybe realize something.
Barney says he tripped,
but it sure felt like<br/>he tackled me on purpose.
And when Robin won,
I could have sworn I saw him smile.
- I won!<br/>- No!
So I said, "the cab, of course"
I know what you did back there.
Yeah.
Check it.
I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks,
and I still smell incredible.
Smell me.
I'm not gonna...
- Not gonna...<br/>- Smell me.
He did smell incredible.
Wait a minute.
So, where is Woody Allen?
He's right there.
Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.
I always get those two confused.
Technically, there was only<br/>one winner that day.
And in that race, everyone<br/>found exactly what they needed.
It's true,
she wouldn't see Woody Allen
for another couple months,
but that's how Robin became,
by just about any definition of the term...
A real New Yorker.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the fall of 2010,
I was designing<br/>the new headquarters
for Goliath National Bank,
which meant<br/>working side by side
with your Uncle Barney.
I love your idea
about a giant<br/>rooftop ring of fire
you can jump through<br/>with a motorcycle,
but I tweaked it<br/>slightly and...
This is still<br/>super bad-ass.
It's now a patio garden<br/>where you can bring a nice bag lunch.
Sick.
Yeah.
Dude.
Working together<br/>is gonna be legen...
Wait for it.
I'll send you an inter-office<br/>memo with the rest
'cause we freakin'<br/>work together!
Everything was going great.
That is, right up<br/>until Barney said...
Oh, big news.
The board finally settled on<br/>a site for the building.
It was the site<br/>of The Arcadian,
one of New York's grandest<br/>old hotels.
In its heyday, it was the New<br/>York home to kings and queens.
But lately...
...mostly just queens.
Hi, handsome.
Lookin' for a date?
Uh, no, thank you.
Still got it.
Barney, we have to talk.
Sure. What's up?
Excuse me,<br/>Mr. Stinson.
Not now, Trish!
But there's an urgent<br/>memo for Mr. Mosby.
"Dary."<br/>Legendary!
So, what's on your mind?
I can't design the building.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, baby. No, no.
Not the slipper socks<br/>with the rubber soles.
I work so hard<br/>to-to set the mood,
and-and when I see those,
I feel the egg go
right back up my Fallopian tube.
Baby, these satin sheets<br/>are slippery.
Papa needs traction.<br/>Traction?
As you know,
Papa likes<br/>to get down with enthusiasm.
Please stop calling<br/>yourself "Papa."
And without traction,
Papa's likely to boogie himself<br/>right out of bed.
It's either these<br/>or soccer cleats.
Hey, so I talked to Robin.
I guess she and Max<br/>hooked up last night.
Kids, as you may remember,<br/>Max was a friend of Marshall's
from law school...
with whom Robin was really<br/>starting to hit it off.
Nice! I love that guy.
Max is both his name<br/>and his level of awesomeness.
Yeah. He's a sweet guy.
She feels really<br/>comfortable with him.
They bonded over hockey.
I guess he has a small penis,
but they want to<br/>double-date next weekend.
Why would you tell me that?
So you'll clear your schedule.
No! The other part!
Oh, the small penis thing?
Ah! Don't! Stop saying that!
Why do you keep saying that?<br/>You...
I don't want to know that.
I'm not going to be able<br/>to look the guy in the eye.
I'm certainly not going<br/>to be able to call him "Max."
That's insane.
I mean, just because you<br/>know Max has a small penis...
Just don't!
You're kidding me.
I'm sorry. I can't do this
if it means tearing down<br/>The Arcadian.
It's an architectural landmark.
Plus, people live there.
How does GNB plan to get<br/>hundreds of residents
to just up and leave?
Snakes.<br/>Did you just say "snakes"?
I don't recall saying "snakes""
Ted, I know you love crappy<br/>old stuff no one cares about.
But I'm gonna give you<br/>four words to live by:
New is always better.
New is always better?
You know who's<br/>a million times hotter
than the hottest girl<br/>I've ever slept with?
Her okay-looking friend<br/>I haven't seen naked.
Why?
Because new is always better.
Mm-hmm? And this theory<br/>applies to everything?
Everything.
So, those new
Star Wars movies...
Those are better<br/>than the old ones?
Yeah. The first three<br/>barely mention
the intricacies<br/>of intergalactic trade law.
And when you're<br/>at a Guns n' Roses concert,
you're like, "Yeah, yeah,<br/>Paradise City, whatever.
When are they gonna rock me<br/>some Chinese Democracy"?
Axl's really matured<br/>as a songwriter, Ted.
Wendy! I'd like to buy<br/>my friend a drink.
What's your oldest Scotch?
Glenmckenna, aged 30 years<br/>in oak casks.
Amazing.
And what's your newest scotch?
Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch.
Don't let it touch your skin.
Your call, buddy.
A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's<br/>Grape Scotch sounds lovely.
Lots of ice.
New is always better, Ted!
That's a rule.
Just like bigger<br/>is always better!
Pfft. That's not true.
Uh, sometimes smaller is better.
"Hey, look how big<br/>my cell phone is!"
You don't hear people say that.
No. You want<br/>something compact
and efficient that fits<br/>comfortably in your pocket,
and I think Max<br/>is just a great guy.
Lily told you.
Told him what?
Max has a small penis.
How can you speak<br/>of such things?
Girls talk about everything.
Size, shape,
left or right<br/>leaning orientation...
Length, resemblance to<br/>a historical figure,
such as Winston Churchill...
Yes, that's one of you.
Girth, grooming...
How can you speak<br/>of such things?
You're kidding.
Barney, every time I mention<br/>a woman you don't know,
the first thing<br/>you say is, "Boobs?"
Not the complete sentence,<br/>"Does she have big boobs?"
Which also would not be great.
Just: "Boobs?"
I do not do that.
My friend Lori from work...
Boobs? Damn it.
But... seriously.
Boobs?
So why is it okay
for guys to talk about boobs,
but the moment we<br/>bring up a topic
like Max's small penis...
I'm gonna pretend this<br/>conversation never happened.
Impossible. Max's penis is stuck<br/>in my brain like a splinter.
Like a splinter-sized splinter.
Speaking of<br/>disappointing weenies...
Ted, tell them what you told me
I want to ask the board at GNB
to move the site<br/>for the new headquarters
so we don't have to tear<br/>down a classic old building.
I still don't get this.
Why, all of a sudden,<br/>out of nowhere,
do you want to ruin...
Wait a minute.
Who's the girl?
- Duh. <br/>- Of course there's a girl.
What? I...
There's no g-girl.
Why would you even...
Her name is Zoey.
Boobs?
Beautiful building, right?
Look, mister, you<br/>are very convincing,
and I am very flattered.
Confused, even.
But I'm not looking...
I'm not a drag queen.
But you definitely have me<br/>rethinking this eye shadow.
Not only is she funny,
hot and genetically female,
but get this...
Look at the Palladian windows,<br/>the rusticated stonework,
the marble cornices...
She's an architecture nerd!
A hot architecture nerd!
That's the dream!
Whose dream?
We wound up talking for hours.
I love how old parts<br/>of the city are.
Hmm.
It makes me feel<br/>connected to history.
Old is always better.<br/>I can't wait to be old.
Me, too.
You can wear<br/>elastic everything.
Your lipstick doesn't have<br/>to stay inside the lines.
You can shoplift and pretend<br/>you're just confused.
You could nap anywhere.<br/>Uh-huh.
Even while driving.
It's gonna be great.
I can't wait to be all run-down<br/>and weathered and wrinkly.
Well, I'd say you got<br/>a pretty long wait.
That's sweet.
It would be sweeter<br/>if you hadn't thought
I was a tranny before,<br/>but it's still sweet.
Oh, Ted, that's so romantic.
I want to fill a pillowcase
with dead batteries<br/>and beat you with it.
Hey, Ted,
can I ask you something?
Anything.
Will you sign this petition?
"Save The Arcadian""
We are gonna stop the bastards<br/>at Goliath National Bank
from demolishing it.
Will you support us?
And you said...?
Where do I sign?
Hmm.
Grape scotch.<br/>Not bad.
Ted, you only think The<br/>Arcadian needs to be saved
because some pretty<br/>girl thinks that.
And seriously...
Boobs?
This isn't about the girl.
It's about the building.
And what did this "Zoey" say
when she found out<br/>that you're the one
tearing down her<br/>beloved Arcadian?
That you, Ted Mosby, are the<br/>Architect Of Destruction?
Whoa!
Sweet wrestling name alert.
Well...
Uh, it's a... it's a<br/>funny thing about that...
So what do you do, Ted?
I'm a veterinarian.
What? I panicked!
This whole Arcadian<br/>thing is classic Mosby.
Changing your personality<br/>to fit some girl.
I don't do that.
Well, off to meet Steph.
We're adrenaline junkies!
Penelope is taking me to<br/>the Battle of Gettysburg.
We're gonna eat squirrel!
Look, she's really hot, okay?
Aww!<br/>Come on! Come on!
We all change a little<br/>for whoever we're into.
Barney pretended<br/>to be a rabbi to get laid.
Asian girls love<br/>them some Jews.
And Marshall never<br/>would've listened
to The Indigo Girls<br/>if it weren't for Lily.
Um, I think you got that<br/>backwards there, Chief.
And you're welcome.
The point is,<br/>you weren't pretending
to like the Indigo Girls<br/>for the other person.
You realized you liked them<br/>because of the other person.
Just like me, Zoey<br/>and The Arcadian.
Did GNB really put snakes<br/>in The Arcadian?
No.
Technically, they were eggs.
Did you just say "eggs"?<br/>I don't recall saying "eggs."
So I walk into my boss's office
and suddenly I realize,
"Holy crap, I'm about to quit""
Small penis.
You have a small penis.
Oh, that's super interesting,<br/>but you have a small penis.
Damn it, Marshall!
Okay. Okay.<br/>Think of any two words
other than "small" or "penis."
Got it: small penis.
Damn it!
Yeah, I-I think it is so cool
that you started<br/>your own law firm.
Well, right now it's<br/>a pretty small practice.
Hey, hey.
I bet it's not that small.
Bro, it's...
pretty small.
Yeah, but, uh,<br/>you know what they say.
The important thing is-is<br/>how you use it, you know?
"The motion of the ocean."<br/>That whole thing.
He said it's small, Marshall,<br/>and everybody's fine with that.
Let's just move on.
I'm just saying that I bet<br/>it's bigger than he thinks.
And thick.
Nah.<br/>Everything about it is tiny.
The office is tiny.<br/>The conference room is tiny.
Plus, I got a very small staff.
Let's order!
As I was mustering<br/>the courage to call Zoey
and tell her<br/>my true identity...
Zoey...
I'm Batman.
Hmm. That'd be cool.
...the strangest thing<br/>happened.
I need your help.
Just to warn you.
What I'm about
to show you is not<br/>a hundred percent legal.
Wasn't expecting bunnies.
I stole them, Ted.
My animal rights group<br/>liberated these guys
from an evil cosmetics company.
And I figured,<br/>"Hey, Ted's a vet.
He can check them out<br/>and make sure they're okay."
Absolutely. Just let me run up<br/>and get my bag of vet supplies.
Okay.
Why would I say that?
Well, I know what I'm getting.
Oh? Oh?<br/>The porterhouse.
I've had it here before.
It is like this. It's huge.
Well, spare no expense, buddy.
Dinner is on me,<br/>and-and get dessert.
Maybe this molten chocolate<br/>lava cake?
I just want you to be happy.
Thanks, man.
Next time, it is on me.<br/>Aw.
- Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right. <br/>- Totally.
We'll just be here.
You're great.
Ah. Thanks, bro.
It's, uh.... it's<br/>going on a while.
I know.
Thanks.
Damn, baby, be cool!
You're acting like
he has six months to live.
It's your fault!
You ladies<br/>and your salty sailor talk!
Oh, come on! What about you men<br/>and your locker room talk?
Locker room talk.
Do you want to know<br/>what it's like
in a men's locker room?
Hey.<br/>Hey.
It's just a bunch<br/>of uncomfortable dudes
trying to get out of there<br/>as quickly as possible.
And one old guy<br/>just letting it all hang out.
Are you suggesting
that guys don't talk about sex?
Yes, we do,<br/>but you know what we say?
"I hit that."
"I got some."
"I tapped it."
"I squeezed those."
Discreet and efficient.
Not to mention classy.
Thank God that I'm not dating.
If I thought that Lily talked<br/>in that much detail
about our sex life,<br/>I'd probably kill myself.
Oh, no.
What did you tell her?
Oh, nothing.
We don't talk about you!
Are you sure?
Yeah. That argument<br/>has no traction whatsoever.
You just broke in<br/>and stole these guys?
Aren't you worried<br/>about getting arrested?
Nah. I've been arrested<br/>lots of times.
Chinese Democracy.
Wow.
You're a little bit crazy.
Well, I'm usually crazy<br/>for a good cause.
I can't just sit by while<br/>voiceless people or animals,
or even buildings<br/>get screwed over.
I'm certainly not going<br/>to just sit by
while GNB turns The Arcadian<br/>into a soulless metal box.
Yeah. Yeah.
Although I hear there's<br/>a lovely rooftop patio
where folks can enjoy a<br/>nice bag lunch, so...
Ted, I will find the bastards<br/>at GNB responsible for this,
and I promise you,
I will take them down.
Cuckoo!
Ted, this woman is an anarchist,
a sociopath, a lunatic,
and for the love of God, boobs?!
Solid C-cup, perky bounce.
Momentary grudging respect.
Zoey does<br/>what she believes is right,
and I want to do the same thing.
We have to find a new site<br/>for this building.
Ted, that is never gonna happen.
Well, I can't tear down<br/>The Arcadian.
I'm sorry,<br/>but I'm off the project.
Hey, guys!
I appreciate the great turnout,
but just so we're all<br/>on the same page,
this is not a rally<br/>to legalize marijuana.
Oh, bummer!
Hey.
Hey, Ted.
I'm so glad you came.
Well, you really got<br/>to me the other night.
I want to get involved<br/>with "Save The Arcadian."
Great. I'll grab<br/>you a picket sign.
Hmm.
Do you want "GNB puts the<br/>douche in fiduciary..""
...or "It's always 4:20<br/>somewhere"?
Dudes, you forgot your signs!
As I looked up at that<br/>magnificent old structure,
I realized I wasn't letting my<br/>feelings for Zoey mislead me.
This building really was<br/>worth saving.
Ted, everything okay?
Yea... um... um...
You work for GNB?
Dude, why are you dressed<br/>like a wizard?
She was really hot, okay?
How the hell could you do that?
Simple. I rented the chair.
The bunny was here already.<br/>That was lucky.
I waited<br/>to do the dramatic swivel
until I heard your key<br/>enter the door.
The billboard, Barney.
I had to. Now that you have<br/>no shot with the girl,
you'll realize you never cared<br/>about the building,
and everything can go back<br/>to normal.
You're wrong. I do care.
And I'm still quitting.
Don't you get it, Ted?
We're tearing down The<br/>Arcadian either way.
It's a stupid old piece-of-crap,<br/>run-down, snake-infested dump!
Okay, are there<br/>or aren't there snakes?!
Who mentioned snakes?!
And stop shouting!
You're scaring Cottontail.
You named the rabbit?
You took longer to get here<br/>than I thought,
we bonded, I'm keeping her.
The point is,
you now have a chance
to design your own building.
Dude,
you can do<br/>whatever you want with it.
You're right.
You're right. I can<br/>design it however I want.
So you're back in?
Yeah.
That night, as I<br/>worked on a new design
that just might solve<br/>all my problems...
...Marshall was visited<br/>by a disturbing vision.
Ugh, he thinks I like this...
But it feels disgusting.
Uh, it looks disgusting.
Um...
Uh, is this working for you?
"Uh, is this<br/>working for you?"
Oh, of course,
because what woman doesn't<br/>like being slobbered on
while some giant paws<br/>at her nether regions
like Lenny from<br/>Of Mice and Men?
Oh, you're bad.
More Cosmos?
Mm.
I can't... I<br/>can't do this!
I can't stop thinking<br/>about you and Robin!
Oh, I've had that<br/>a couple times.
Just lean into it<br/>and let it fuel things.
Look, no. You know what?
Why don't you just...<br/>Why don't you just
call Robin, okay,<br/>and have a good laugh about it?
Whoa!
Traction could have<br/>prevented that.
Well,
hope you don't mind, we made<br/>some changes to the billboard.
Well, that explains<br/>a few voicemails.
Listen, Zoey, I think<br/>we can save The Arcadian.
No. Maybe not
in the way you were picturing,
but I stayed up all night
working on a new<br/>concept, all right?
What if my design<br/>could incorporate
The Arcadian's facade
into the new GNB headquarters?
Kids, it was one<br/>of those moments in life
where everything<br/>comes together...
the girl, the building,<br/>everything, until...
Are you married?<br/>Yeah.
So you were saying, the facade<br/>will be completely preserved?
This isn't about the girl.
It's about the building.
Yeah, it was about the girl.
Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?
This wouldn't work.
Zoey, The Arcadian was<br/>a really great building once,
but it's falling apart,<br/>and it's full of snakes.
Snakes?<br/>I don't recall saying snakes.
Then he gets this panicked look<br/>on his face, says,
"I can't do this,"<br/>and storms out.
Wow, that is weird.
But here's the crazier part.
No. You know what?
Papa don't back down<br/>from a fight.
So why don't you tell Robin...<br/>about this!
It was amazing.
He was passionate, animalistic,
a complete stud.
Wow.
So he's right there<br/>making you say all this, huh?
Yup. "'You're like<br/>a Greek god,'
I moaned, as the..."
I can't read that, baby.
"Musky scent of man."
"As the musky scent of man
"and Marshall's sure-footed<br/>traction intoxicated
and overpowered me."
That sounds real.
And as for Zoey, it was funny.
I'd lied to her,<br/>then completely let her down.
And I barely knew the girl.
But there was something<br/>about her.
I couldn't help but wonder<br/>if I'd ever see her again.
Hey, Mosby!
You're gonna have
to come out of your hole at<br/>some point, you son of a bitch!
Yeah!
Legalize it!
Dude!
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
Why, yes.
Yes, I would see her again.
Hey. Hey.<br/>Hey.
How's it going with Robin?
Uh, I think<br/>I have to break up with her.
Really? Why?<br/>You with her?
Yeah, well, there's this...
kind of weird thing she likes<br/>to do in the bedroom.
Hey, what's not for everyone?
Guys, come on.<br/>What is it?
Come on, bro.
This is a locker room.
I...
What do you think<br/>it was, Murray?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the fall of 2010,
our friends Stuart and Claudia had a baby,
and Lily and Marshall were the first
to visit the happy new parents.
So, have you guys
landed on a name yet?
We're trying, but it's<br/>tougher than you think.
You see, I like "Tiffany."
And I don't want my daughter<br/>to have a whore's name.
That's my mother's name.
I know.
Oh, I got it.
How 'bout we name the baby<br/>after you... "Frigid Shrew."
Oh, that's good.
No, no, no, no.
Let's call her "Vodka."
Then at least we know you'd hold her tight
and never let her go!
Don't knock the vodka.<br/>Wouldn't have a kid without it.
Stuart, you are so...
That's not gonna be us, right?
I mean, how hard can it be<br/>to name a baby?
- Right? I mean, just look at her.<br/>- Yeah.
She's clearly a...
- Emily.<br/>- Lisa.
- Lisa?!<br/>- Emily?!
- Uh-oh.<br/>- Uh-oh.
Okay!
I made a list of awesome baby names.
Starting at the top: number one...
I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall.
You name a chubby white kid "LeBron,"
and he's the one getting stuffed<br/>in the basketball hoop.
Then I'm also crossing off,<br/>um, "Shaquille"...
Mm-hmm.
"Hakeem," and "Dikembe."
Hey, what about "Rob"?
"Rob"?
- No.<br/>- Why not?
Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make?
A turkey?
Honka, honka!
Not "Rob."
Okay, um, how about "Ryan"?
Ooh.
Not "Ryan."
"Johnny?"
Hey, where's the goldfish?
Not "Johnny."
Or "Gil."
"Jeremy."
Jeremy, no!
Definitely not "Jeremy."
His stuff was so derivative.
Well, I mean, geez, Lily.
Well, whatever you do,
do not name your baby "Becky," right?
- Why? What?<br/>- What?
Becky. My new co-anchor?
Don't you guys ever watch the show?
Oh, honey, I really try.<br/>Our DVR won't recognize it
- as a television program.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
I watched.
Robin insisted I confirm<br/>how "awful" Becky is,
so last night I checked it out.
Peace talks in the region
have been described as, "productive."
Becky?
Last night, in Staten Island,
a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint.
Aww...
That's so sad.
Becky, we're-we're journalists.
We can't get emotional<br/>about the news, we...
Oh, no!
They stole all his money<br/>and then pelted him
with his own taco meat!
Who would do that?
Well, if you read the story,<br/>we might find out.
Oh, can I do this one, about the horse?
I love horseys.
Mm-hmm.
Aww, the horse died.
Guys!
This news is all really sad.
Okay, no holds barred...<br/>What'd you think of Becky?
Mmm...
I thought she was charming.
You, too?
Can somebody please explain to me
why the little girl act works on men?
You want the long version<br/>or the short version?
Short version.
Short version.
Who's your daddy?
You know, when you think about that,
that phrase is really creepy.
No, it's not. It's fun.
Here, watch this.
Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?
Okay, uh, let me get this straight.
So, in, uh, in this scenario,
because you make such sweet love to Lily,
she is now your daughter.
No, she is not my daughter.
I'm just her daddy.
Wow. That is disgusting.
Exactly. And it's not like<br/>the opposite would work.
There's no way a guy could pick up a girl,
going around talking like a little boy.
- Challenge accepted.<br/>- No.
I, Barney Stinson,
will pick up a girl whilst<br/>talking like a little boy.
Okay.
Here's my list of baby names.
- Oh.<br/>- What about "Tara"?
No.
Not "Tara."
Tara was the hottest girl<br/>in my high school.
We were all, like, obsessed with her.
We didn't just talk about her
and fantasize about her...
We wrote songs about her.
♪ Tara, your booty is so smooth ♪
♪ And I hope this isn't rude ♪
♪ But I want to get up on it. ♪
Not "Tara."
What about "Esther"?
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Coming up on the main stage,
give it up for Esther!
Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney.
That prime rib was surprisingly good,
but it's 10:30 in the morning.
I don't need to see<br/>a lady get naked and dance.
Oh, Esther gets naked.
But she doesn't dance.
Then what does she do?
Sweet mother nature!
That was my card!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Give it up for Esther!
Not "Esther."
I need a drink. Ted? Ted?
Marshall, your list is entirely boy names.
You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance
of you having a daughter, right?
Okay, honestly, I've never<br/>thought about having a girl.
I don't want to think about having a girl.
Tara, Esther...
can you imagine being<br/>one of those girls' dads?
♪ Marshall's daughter ♪
♪ Your booty ♪
♪ Your booty's so smooth. ♪
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
On the main stage, give it up<br/>for Marshall's daughter.
He screwed up my childhood.
That's why I do this.
I have no idea how to raise a daughter!
What if she makes bad choices?
I mean, what if she winds up dating some...
Oh, God.
Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.
Hey, bro.
Thanks for making such a hottie.
Who's your daddy?
You are, 'cause of all the sex we have.
I don't want a girl.
I just want a little boy.
It's not what it sounds like, folks.
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
Marshall? Is that you?
Oh, okay, um...
You guys, you're a little<br/>too close to the camera.
Can you back up a bit?
How's this?
Every time.
Um, can you just sit<br/>in front of the computer
like normal human beings?
Perfect!
Perfect.
What's up, shooter?
Um, to be honest,<br/>I'm getting a little freaked out
about the idea of having a daughter.
I know you two probably<br/>aren't the right people
to talk to about this. You had all boys.
Oh, well, that was just dumb luck.
Hey, honey, would you get me a<br/>brewski from out of the shed?
Sure. You want anything, Marshall?
I'm in a computer, Mom.
Oh.
Yeah, all boys.
Total co-winky-dink.
It was no co-winky-dink.
Since the Viking age,
the Eriksen men have<br/>passed down ancient secrets
for conceiving boys.
Number one, avoid lemons.
They're baby girl fertilizer.
Okay... No offense, Dad,
but I doubt there's any<br/>scientific data to support...
"I doubt there's<br/>any scientific data to support..."
I had all sons.
Your grandfather had all sons.
Your great-grandfather had all sons.
Scoreboard!
Who you gonna listen to?
Me? Or "scientific data"?
Members of the G-8
convened today in Vienna
to discuss plans to fight
climate change by re... What?
Ask me what I did yesterday.
Hey, Becky, Becky, this is<br/>our news segment, okay?
Nobody cares what you did yesterday.
Lighten up, Robin.
What'd you do, sweetheart?
Mike!
Well, I'm new in town<br/>and don't know many people.
But yesterday, I met the sweetest man,
who took me on a tour of the city.
Guys, New York is kind of cool.
Okay, back to the G-8 conference.
Hello?
Mike, can I get in the shot?
Fantastic.
Then this cutie patootie
took me to this bar called MacLaren's,
right underneath his apartment.
Wait... Did you go out with Ted Mosby?
Yes!
Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate.
I saw her bedroom.
She's a messy Bessie.
In other news, later today,
a Manhattan architect gets<br/>punched in the throat.
Ow!
Ted, of all the women in New York,
you had to go out with<br/>an eight-year-old girl?
Not what it sounds like, folks.
Ted, you know that I hate her.
How could you go out<br/>on a date with this girl?
It wasn't a date.
She came over to<br/>the apartment looking for you.
I made Robin my famous<br/>chocolate chip cookies.
But instead of chocolate chips,<br/>I used gummie bears.
Aww...
A spider!
Let me guess: she acted<br/>like a helpless little girl,
and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
I don't know if that's totally true.
It's okay, little darlin'.
Poor spider.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.
Then I held her tight and told<br/>her it was all gonna be okay.
By the way, I think<br/>I only wounded the spider.
It crawled off into my bedroom.
Wait. Is that why you slept<br/>on the couch last night?
Yeah, I slept.
I'm dying out here.
Talking like a little boy<br/>is not working with the ladies.
Wow, lady.
You got some tig ol' bitties!
Gosh!
Your body's a perfect...
This many.
Hi.
Do you want to wrestle with our<br/>special bathing suit places?
Come on!
Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.
I know you think that's a compliment,
but I'd rather you took your time.
No, um... I'll be right back.
Ancient Norse wisdom<br/>tells us that, to sire a son,
you must do three things right<br/>before you lay with your maiden.
First, eat pickled herring.
Eat it!
This is ridiculous.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage,
throwing her life away,
give it up for Marshall's daughter!
Who's your granddaddy?
That guy.
Hey, want to have a three-way
with me and my imaginary friend?
His name's Otis.
Hey, hey, want to come to my house
and play telephone?
I got the string; you got the cans.
I wet myself!
Will you change me?
Can't blame her on that one.
Guys...
I have some terrible, terrible news.
I, Barney Stinson,
can't pick up a girl whilst<br/>talking like a little boy.
Challenge forfeited.
Yeah, we don't care about this...<br/>No one challenged you,
so it wasn't really a challenge.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt?
Nobody could pick up<br/>a chick wearing that thing.
Challenge accept...
Wow, I'm glad that's over.
It was creepy watching Barney<br/>talk like a little kid.
Oh, but you find it irresistible<br/>when Becky does?
I don't get it.
The Ted that I went out with was<br/>attracted to the kind of woman
who could use a steak knife<br/>without supervision.
For your information,<br/>Becky doesn't like steak,
she likes pasghetti.
Spaghetti.
And more importantly,<br/>she makes me feel needed.
Needed?
She makes training wheels feel needed.
Hey, it's nice to feel needed.<br/>And you know what?
It's not a feeling guys get<br/>when they're with you.
Son...
Viking lore tells us<br/>that to ensure the continuation
of your noble male lineage...
Get a big old bowl of ice
and dunk your man sack right in there!
You two and your football.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Now get in there, point Lily due north
and make me a grandson!
Eriksen!
Eriksen!
When we were dating, I...<br/>I didn't make you feel needed?
Come on! You always<br/>took charge of everything.
Oop.
I got this.
Thanks.
This okay? Am I hurting y...
- I got this.<br/>- Whoa!
Someone's trying to break in...<br/>Call the cops.
I got this.
Did that really bother you?
Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
It's Becky.
Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.
I got this.
Yeah.
Let's make a baby!
Mm, mm, mm, mm! Whoa!
Baby, you're packing snowballs,
and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.
Loving the dirty talk... But<br/>you know what's even hotter?
If we face this-a-way.
Ooh, we're bad.
Wait... hey, baby,
why are you facing me north?
You're trying to make us have a boy.
I... can ex...
How do you know about the north thing?
Um, um...
And what are you doing with those lemons?
Baby girl fertilizer!
You're trying to make us have a girl!
You are trying to make us have a girl.
All my least favorite students<br/>have been boys.
So I Googled "how to make a girl"...
some really weird stuff came up...
But finally, I found<br/>this conception website
that said you should...
Point south at the moment of conception...
Eat a lemon...
And heat up your lady parts<br/>to a balmy 105 degrees.
Ooh... Ah...
Oh, that's not bad.
Eriksen!
Lily, how could you do...
exactly the same thing I did?
You're supposed to be the sane one.
See that?<br/>Another boy expecting a woman
to clean up his mistakes.
That's why girls are way better than boys.
Oh, really. Well, then how<br/>come whenever there's
a creepy kid in a horror movie<br/>it's always a little girl?
Or twin girls, who speak...
In unison.
Oh, well, what about Chucky?
Okay, A) He was a doll;
B) He was possessed<br/>by an adult serial killer;
and C) How could you bring up<br/>Chucky right before bed?
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
Hey. Um, when we were dating,
did... Did I make you feel needed?
No, I didn't feel like<br/>you needed me at all.
That's what I thought.
- Uh, I'm sorry.<br/>- Wait, where are you...
That's a compliment.
You are the least needy woman<br/>I've ever met... That's awesome.
I mean, no guy's gonna say.
"Who's your daddy?" to Robin Scherbatsky.
You're your own daddy.
And mommy.
And weird survivalist uncle<br/>who lives in a cabin
with a shotgun<br/>blaming stuff on the government.
And that is what makes you the most...
Amazing, strong...
independent woman I've ever banged.
Thanks, Barney.
You know, um...
there's something that I wanted to ask you,
and I don't really know how<br/>to say it so... Here goes.
Who's the crazy chick in the apron?
Someone naughty left his toys on the floor
and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.
Uh-oh, I'm in "twubble."
You did it? How?
Last night, after admitting defeat,
I just let myself go.
Mmm, that looks so good.
Can I have some?
No!
It's my ice cream; you can't have any.
Someone needs<br/>to teach you how to share.
Who's your mommy?
Challenge completed!
Now, uh, can you get
this freak out of here? I'm really scared.
I got this.
Oh, so you finally agreed on a name?
Uh, well,
the other night she ran<br/>a really high fever.
We rushed her to the emergency room
at 3:00 in the morning, but they wouldn't
admit her without a name.
Right then and there, we<br/>realized how stupid we were being.
We looked at each other
and, well, we just knew.
Our baby's name is...
- Esther.<br/>- Esther.
Esther?
Esther!
That's beautiful.
Yeah.
We're idiots.
Baby, names and gender, it's just, like...
it's some way of giving<br/>ourselves the illusion
that we have any control whatsoever.
I... I just want a healthy,<br/>happy, 12-pound...
Whoa.
Ten-pound?
Eight-pound?
I guess, but, dude,
you're writing checks my vagina can't cash.
I love you.
And I'm gonna love the crap<br/>out of whatever baby we have.
Me, too.
You know what?
We should just think of a name that's<br/>good for either a girl or a boy.
Like, um...
- Jamie.<br/>- Jamie.
Marshall...
We just named our baby.
Jamie.
- Mmm...<br/>- Mmm...
Not Jamie.
Shoe's untied. I got it.
Yeah, this is over.

[<div class="full-script">And so, due to one<br/>architectural oversight,
the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906
claimed the lives of 75 people.
Now, I hate to stop<br/>while I'm on a roll,
but happy Halloween, ya crazies!
Professor Brosby, you gonna<br/>come get beers with us later?
Nah, I got a thing.
But you kids have fun<br/>trick or treating.
This is our treat.
You're the coolest, Professor Mosby.
Well, hot dog.
- Did it hurt?<br/>- What?
Getting that kid's nose<br/>surgically removed from your ass.
It's not her nose<br/>that's in my ass, Lily,
it's her heart.
My class loves me.
I'm really making<br/>an impression on those guys.
I'd like to make impression<br/>on those guys.
Man, I love the office<br/>Halloween party.
It is so much sluttier<br/>than the office Christmas party.
Though not as freaky
as the office President's Day Rave.
Or the office Tu B'Shvat<br/>Pajama Jammy-Jam.
Hey, guys.<br/>Hey, Boss.
Hey, Randy.<br/>You want a beer?
No, thank you. I brew my own.
At the risk of bragging,<br/>my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize
at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam<br/>Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.
I wouldn't consider any<br/>part of that bragging.
It just occurred to me,<br/>is your friend...
What's her name? Garbin, Flabin...
Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna<br/>be here? Not that I really care.
Robin has another party to go to.
No! Damn it!
- I'm leaving.<br/>- But she might stop by later.
I guess I can<br/>hang out a little longer.
So, anyone going to see<br/>the Halloween parade?
We were big fans of New York's<br/>annual Halloween parade.
I don't mean the one that takes place<br/>Halloween night in the Village.
I mean the one that takes place<br/>the morning of November 1st...
the Annual Post Halloween<br/>Walk of Shame Parade.
Look at them heading home
after their dirty, filthy hookups.
Looks like that bee got busy.
Looks like that French maid<br/>didn't turn down somebody's bed.
Looks like Pocahontas<br/>has a couple of wounded knees.
- Come on.<br/>- That's a line.
- It's because of the...<br/>- We get it.
Does it get any better than this?
Yes, it does.
Crap.

There she is...
Florence-Night-In-Bed<br/>With-A-Stranger.
- So, who's the lucky patient?<br/>- I don't want to talk about it.
Please tell me you're not hooking up<br/>with one of your co-anchors again.
- My co-anchor's a woman.<br/>- Please tell me you are.
Robin had always believed
the key to success was intelligence,<br/>hard work and professionalism.
Her new co-anchor<br/>had a different philosophy.
It's the Farhampton Boat Show!
Remember 5th, 6th and 7th<br/>at the Farhampton Civic Center.
Come on down.
You did a commercial?
Why not?
You're a journalist!<br/>Don't you wanna be taken seriously?
No. I'm cute.
Well, if you really think<br/>this is going to help your image.
Boats, boats, boats!
Robin, a little help here?
You gotta not worry so much<br/>about being liked.
Easy for you to say.<br/>Everybody loves you at your job.
That was true of my teaching job.
But I was also designing<br/>the new headquarters
for GNB, and well...
We don't like you!
What do you say to yourself,<br/>tearing down a beautiful, old building
to put up<br/>a stupid bank headquarters?
Boo...
freakin'...
hoo.
Boo freakin' hoo? That's it?
The Arcadian<br/>is an architecturally significant...
Architecturally significant?!
You're very pretty.<br/>Your hair smells great.
Shampoo.<br/>You should try it sometime.
You don't know the first thing<br/>about architecture.
Key, Ted Mosby's car.
Go on.
I'm a professor, okay?
I teach this stuff at one<br/>of the best colleges in the country.
I don't go down to your place<br/>of non-employment and lecture you
about how your little protest<br/>is a misguided waste of time,
except, whoops, I just did.
Ha-burn.
- Good, the eggs are here.<br/>- Well, I should head up.
No, GNB was not popular.
That's why every year they produced<br/>a video to improve the bank's image.
What makes Goliath National Bank<br/>different from other big banks?
Here at GNB, we care.
I care about our precious Earth.
I care about old people.
I care about high-yield<br/>offshore investments.
And so does Tugboat here.
Isn't that right, Tugboat?<br/>Yeah.
Okay, get that camera out of my face
before I flip you<br/>like a cheese omelet.
All you have to do is say,
"I care about<br/>making dreams come true."
First of all, that line<br/>makes me sound like a hooker
and saying it makes me<br/>feel like a hooker.
Everyone is in this video.
Randy's in the video.
I don't want to brag,<br/>but in 29 takes,
I only threw up thrice.
Randy, did you send the Hermanson<br/>contracts downtown?
I did.
I sent them downtown.
Why are you saying it like that? They<br/>never arrived at the downtown office.
They...
To make sure we're on the same page,<br/>is "send them downtown"
not an expression<br/>for shredding a document?
You shredded them?
I sent them downtown.
You know, down into the shredder.
You feed the paper
in a downwards fashion, so that's<br/>where the expression comes from.
That's not an expression!<br/>That has never been an expression!
I can fix this.<br/>I am all over this project.
I'll say this,<br/>there is no quit in that guy.
- You should fire him.<br/>- Okay, that, that right there.
That attitude is exactly why<br/>I won't be in your video.
Because GNB doesn't care.
They hand out pink slips<br/>like they're hors d'oeuvres.
Last week,<br/>I was talking to Arthur...
You're wearing a green tie now.
I'm wearing a green tie.
GNB treats people like<br/>they're disposable,
and I will not be a part of that.
Marshall Eriksen
does not fire people, period.
Just want you to know, we are making<br/>good progress on this new project.
You gentlemen keep talking,<br/>I will answer that.
Marshall Eriksen's office.
Yeah, I can get that for you.<br/>Just a second.
Bank.<br/>The B stands for bank.
Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight.
Yikes. I'd better get<br/>Mr. Messy a napkin.
Period.
Tell me who you slept with!
I don't want to get into it.
It's someone we know.
If it was some ding dong we didn't know,<br/>you'd just give me his name.
Fine.
It's Bill Pepper.
Bill Pepper.
Kind of a coincidence<br/>there happens to be
a bill and a pepper<br/>shaker here on the table.
Any chance you and Bill had<br/>a three-way with Fork Napkin?
It's someone we know!
I'm assuming you all read the chapters<br/>on the Greek Revival architecture.
Questions?
Yes.<br/>How do you sleep at night?
- What are you doing here?<br/>- It was recently made clear to me
that I don't know the first<br/>thing about architecture, so...
here I am.
Very well.
Let's get started.
Some examples of Greek Revival<br/>architecture...
Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?
What's The Arcadian?
It's just this beautiful,<br/>old building
that Professor Mosby<br/>wants to tear down.
What? No.
Professor Mosby loves old buildings.
He wouldn't do that.<br/>Right, Ted?
Getting back to Greek Revival...
I lost them.
Look, you're new at teaching.
In my kindergarten class, I have had<br/>plenty of troublesome students.
Like Johnny Marley...
He and that little stuffed horsey<br/>raised all kinds of hell.
But I have a simple method for<br/>shutting down troublemakers.
You know that '98 Taurus<br/>that's always parked outside?
The one with the really<br/>annoying alarm?
We're familiar with it.
When a kid like Johnny<br/>acts up in my class...
Shuts them right up.
My students are adults,<br/>and I treat them that way.
I'll give them more candy and make them<br/>a mix CD. Problem solved.
Baby, what's wrong?
Something bad happened.
- Have you seen...<br/>- Before that,
regarding the earlier project<br/>I was working on...
Voil?!
That's the Hermanson contract?
The Hermanson contract?
Oh, man, this is<br/>the Filbert contract.
Damn it!
Anyway, what's your thing?
I need the Filbert contract!
I'll do what I can.
But in my experience, twice<br/>shredded is fairly permanent.
Sorry, Randy,
but this just isn't working out.
Marshall popped his cherry!
Come on, Marshall, you have to admit,<br/>the guy was a disaster.
It reflected badly on the company.
He was an embarrassment.
A huge embarrassment.
You slept with Randy!
What?
It's elementary,<br/>my dear Scherbatson.
Your co-host is getting super-popular<br/>because of her stupid commercial,
So, when you arrived<br/>at the GNB party after we left,
you were feeling vulnerable
and drunk.
Then, from across<br/>the not-so-crowded conference room,
your eyes met.
And as we all remember...
Randy has a unique condition.
Your nose is bleeding like a faucet.
God, this happens every time<br/>I get an erection, I am so sorry.
That's...
exactly what happened.
If getting fired is an execution,<br/>at least the guy had a last meal.
I promise you,<br/>tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.
What's going on?
I just wanted to say,<br/>no hard feelings.
Thank you.
So where are you headed now?
Downtown.
It's okay, baby.
It wasn't okay.<br/>So the next morning...
Arthur,<br/>I'm here because I made a mistake.
I fired Randy yesterday.
That was a mistake.<br/>You should have fired him a year ago.
No, sir,
that is what's wrong with this company.<br/>How can we say "GNB Cares,"
and then turn around<br/>and treat someone like that?
Sure, he made a few mistakes,<br/>but everybody makes mistakes.
Like Tugboat here.
I bet you he's made some mistakes.
And you didn't fire Tugboat,<br/>did you?
No, I got him fixed,<br/>and he calmed down.
Exactly... kind of.
Randy doesn't need to be fired.<br/>He needs to be fixed.
We do some pretty bad things<br/>around here, but I...
Sir, I'm saying<br/>instead of getting rid of someone
when they screw up, we should...<br/>we should help them.
We should nurture them.
I changed the ice pack on his crotch<br/>every hour for three days.
If you want to un-fire Randy,<br/>I support you,
because to come in here<br/>and say what you just said,
you've got a couple things<br/>that Tugboat doesn't.
Prof Rock<br/>is a really good mix, okay?
A piece of New York history<br/>is being torn down,
and all you could say<br/>was "Boo freakin' hoo"?
I may have mentioned our conversation<br/>over a session of hacky sack.
The one day I miss the sack circle,<br/>you guys sub her in?
Why'd you miss?
Too busy tearing down<br/>the Statue of Liberty?
I was returning a hot dog costume<br/>that you all enjoyed.
They were all turning against me,
so I figured, what the hell.
- And, did it work?<br/>- Like gangbusters. We're buddies again.
After class, we hacked a little sack
to the thumpin' strains<br/>of my Prof Rock CD.
And no, none of them<br/>had heard the Pixies B-side.
Actually, none of them<br/>had heard of the Pixies.
Or a B-side.
I know that smile.
Lily, there's no easy way<br/>to say this.
Marshall's dead.<br/>Randy murdered him.
I know why Randy is smiling.
You're smiling because of Robin.
Like how I think about her<br/>when I'm in the shower?
I'm trying to eat.
Because you slept with her<br/>on Halloween.
What? No.<br/>I went home,
had a shower, and went to bed.
- You didn't sleep with her?<br/>- No.
Even in the shower,<br/>the farthest we ever get is hugging.
So why are you smiling?
I'll tell you why.
This just isn't working out.
I'm fired. Great.
This is the candle kiosk<br/>at the mall all over again.
Wait a minute.
I can get a severance check.
If I don't shred it,
I can use that money<br/>to start my own brewery.
Imagine a beer with my name on it.
Randy Wharmpess,<br/>this is the best day of your life.
Thanks to that severance check,<br/>this time next year,
you'll all be enjoying<br/>a frothy mug of Wharmpess.
Randy, great news!
You're not fired!
Good morning, everybody...
Where's my class?
Ha-boom.
I got you your job back, Randy.
You'd be happy?
But I don't belong here.
I'm born to be a brewer!<br/>A hopsmeister!
Then quit.<br/>No one's stopping you.
I can't.<br/>I need my severance check.
Well, I'm sorry Randy,<br/>but that's called fraud.
It's not fraud.<br/>I'm asking you to get me a lot of money
to not work here<br/>and not tell anyone about it.
Even if I wanted to fire you,<br/>after my talk with Arthur...
Come on, Arthur can't remember that.
What a memorable talk<br/>we had yesterday.
On behalf of everyone at GNB,<br/>both in and out of prison, we're sorry.
And I want to assure you<br/>you will never be fired again.
You're going to work here<br/>until you die!
Green tie?
Nice choice.
Thanks. It brings out my eyes.
I'll bring out your eyes.
Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,
but I broke my own moral code once<br/>and I felt evil.
I will not let GNB change me.
I will never fire anyone again ever.
We'll see about that.
Anyhoo, while I got you, big smile.
"We care about making dreams come true",<br/>in three, two...
What?
Are you unhappy with my performance?
Well, I guess I'm fired, then.<br/>I'd better turn in my I.D.
No, it's actually...
nice having some of this clutter<br/>off my desk.
And there's more.
I dunno what I'll use this for,<br/>but it's great.
Now am I fired?
I've been meaning<br/>to clean out that file cabinet for ages.
I'm not even here.
Randy, the coffee.
I've been meaning<br/>to cut back on my caffeine.
Here, try this,<br/>but really go for it.
Remember, this guy ruined your life.
That's just the pick-me-up I needed.
Speaking of that,<br/>can we try the first one again?
It didn't work. They hate me.<br/>How do I get them to like me again?
You don't.<br/>Ted, you're their teacher.
The only people<br/>that like their teachers...
- I like my teachers.<br/>- ... are dorks.
Except for you, Miles.
You just have to learn<br/>to embrace their hatred.
Because behind that hatred<br/>lies fear.
And you can use use that fear,
like I did with Johnny Marley.
Was there more to that?
A little bit.
Tou're a psychopath.
A little bit.
A panda!
I thought about Lily's advice.
And I figured fear was worth a try.
What do you want to say to us?
Anyone not in class tomorrow<br/>gets an "F".
You said that?
Technically, they'd get an incomplete,<br/>but I thought...
"F" had a nice, scary ring to it.
- Who'd you sleep with?<br/>- I told you, Randy.
He was a machine.
Where's the poop?
Fine.<br/>I didn't sleep with anyone.
The thing is,<br/>ever since Becky did that commercial,
everyone at work loves her.
The day after Halloween,<br/>I was in a commercial.
What... Why didn't you tell us?
Bladder trouble, it's embarrassing,
it's uncomfortable,<br/>and it can affect anyone.
I'm going to the bathroom right now.
Neat and discreet adult diapers<br/>for anyone.
Say...
I can't wait to see it.
Hopefully you never will.<br/>They might not even use it.
It ran for seven years.
You win.
Maybe trashing your office<br/>was a mistake.
It's just as long as I can remember,
making beer has been my dream.
Wharmpess?
I know it sounds dumb to someone<br/>who's already achieved his dream...
big-time lawyer<br/>at a huge corporation.
You think working here is my dream?
Of course.
Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up.
Have someone get that dead squirrel<br/>out of your desk.
This is delicious.
You're fired.
Kids, the next morning,
my class<br/>had the highest attendance ever.
And not long after that,
Randy used his severance money<br/>to start a little brewery.
Now you can have a Wharmpess<br/>at every bar in America.
And all because...
I care about making dreams<br/>come true.
You got what you need?
That's a wrap.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, one morning in 2010,<br/>I opened the newspaper
only to discover an op-ed<br/>written by Zoey Pierson.
You remember Zoey.
Key Ted Mosby's car.
In those four column inches,<br/>she railed against me
and my company, GNB,
for wanting to tear down<br/>a beautiful old building:
The Arcadian.
And as if that<br/>wasn't bad enough,
the piece ran on a Saturday,<br/>which as you both know,
is Dad's crossword day.
She ruined crossword day!
I can't believe this.
She singles me out by name.
Calls me a "fat cat."<br/>Me and my "fat-cat friends."
We're not fat cats.
Exactly.
I say, Marshall, my good<br/>man, how's my bow tie?
Impeccable, old bean.
To industry!<br/>Ah, bully!
Okay, that night we<br/>weren't entirely un-fat-catty.
You see, every year<br/>the Natural History Museum
holds its Autumn Spectacular.
It's attended<br/>by some of the most powerful
and important people<br/>in New York.
And, thanks to<br/>Goliath National Bank...
us.
Look at us, huh?
In tuxedos?
Can you imagine if our college<br/>selves saw us like this?
They'd pelt us<br/>with their Phish bootlegs.
Yeah, we were pretty<br/>anti-establishment back then.
Oh, God, remember Russell?
Oh.
Nice monkey suit, Russell.<br/>Yeah.
Come on, guys.
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you
with that corporate noose<br/>around your neck.
And don't even try showing up<br/>to the drum circle this weekend.
Yeah.
Oh, hey. You guys<br/>seen Russell?
You know why? Because you<br/>can't kick a story in the nuts.
Hey, we're still those people.
One of these days, Marshall's<br/>going to quit his job
and go to work for the NRDC,
and save the world,<br/>right, baby?
Absotively.
But let's just<br/>remember, I mean,
nobody's the same<br/>as they were in college.
You know, it's like, I wear<br/>a suit to work every day.
Well, yeah, but you<br/>wear it ironically,
like Ted's fanny pack.
Next time we go<br/>to Great Adventure,
you're carrying<br/>your own sunblock.
Ooh! I love this exhibit.
One time when I was a kid, this<br/>room was closed for cleaning,
so I snuck under the rope.
Ooh.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
When I was a kid,<br/>I knocked down the blue whale.
Okay, the giant blue whale<br/>hanging from the ceiling?
I was six. My uncle Jerry<br/>brought me here for the day.
He said, "Don't touch anything""
To a kid.
That's like someone telling us,
"Don't look at that girl's perky
and impossibly symmetrical<br/>knockers."
Ooh.
Not bad.
So, naturally, I snapped<br/>the rib off a triceratops,
blahbity-blahbity-blue,<br/>I knocked down the whale.
I'm surprised security<br/>didn't stop me on the way in.
Well, I'm sure<br/>they don't remember.
I mean, it's been like 30 years
since that completely<br/>made-up story didn't happen.
It happened.
And these people don't forget.
This is not the<br/>Natural Stuff That Happened
No More Than Five Minutes Ago<br/>Museum. Huh?
Marshall, Barney,<br/>there you are.
I want you to meet an old friend<br/>of mine from Exeter,
George Van Smoot.
But you can, and should,<br/>call me The Captain.
The Captain?<br/>The Captain?
Back in school we met during<br/>a production of Guys and Dolls.
The Captain was Nathan Detroit<br/>to my assistant stage manager.
Marshall and Barney here,
are the future<br/>of Goliath National Bank.
Well, ahoy.
Ahoy.<br/>Ahoy, The Captain.
The Captain pretty much paid<br/>for this entire shindig.
Please, enjoy yourselves,
have fun,<br/>but don't touch anything.
Thank you, The Captain.<br/>Challenge accepted.
Wow.
"The future of<br/>Goliath National Bank"?
I know, it's so, uh...
You know, I totally forgot<br/>to tell you, but, um,
the other day, Arthur offered<br/>me a five-year contract.
Oh, well, don't turn him down<br/>here in public.
I broke up with Scooter<br/>at the prom.
Right before the picture, too.
So whatever you do, don't tell<br/>him here tonight, 'cause...
I think I'm going to say yes.
Ah, that's the stuff.
Sync by vNaru
I didn't realize you<br/>were small potatoes.
And to be clear, I am<br/>referring to your testicles.
Impressive.
Try this on for size.
You want to dance?
Let's dance.
I live for the dance.
Get... your other hand...
off my ass.
Sorry, sorry.
What do you mean,<br/>you're going to say yes?
I-I want to keep<br/>working at GNB.
But I thought that you...
Guys, guys, guys?
Architecture fun fact:
If you stand right here,<br/>and you whisper,
a person all the way across<br/>the other end of the room
hears it like you're standing<br/>right next to them.
It's one of the most<br/>sophisticated pieces
of acoustical design<br/>in the world. Watch.
Diarrhea.
Right? Right?
But a five-year<br/>contract.
I thought you hated GNB.
Look, I don't hate all of it.
Tonight's fun.
Take a look around.
I mean, this is<br/>pretty high-class.
Poo-poo.
Poo-poo platter.
Zoey?
Well, well, well.
You have got to be kidding me.
So, what are we protesting<br/>tonight?
Rising cost of jet fuel?
The government's oppressive<br/>top hat and monocle tax?
And what are you doing here?
Oh, right.
Beautiful old building...<br/>you're here to knock it down.
Can I finish my drink first?
Darling, there you are.
Hi.<br/>Hi.
Ted, this is my husband.
Yeah, old stuff's great.
Mmm. Ah, this Scotch<br/>is good. How's your drink?
This is ridiculous.
We are two grown adults standing<br/>among the greatest collection
of natural artifacts<br/>in the Western hemisphere,
and look at what we're doing.
You're right.
Want to go touch<br/>a bunch of stuff?
Yeah, I do.
So, Captain.
How'd you get that name, anyway?
Gave it to myself.
A real man chooses<br/>his own name.
Well, pleased to meet you,<br/>Captain.
I'm Galactic President<br/>Superstar McAwesomeville.
This is Ted.<br/>Capital.
Honey, I may cut out early.
I have to go check up<br/>on the boat.
The boat?<br/>There's a boat?
You must tell me about<br/>this boat, Captain.
Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.
She!<br/>Do you like boats?
Does the sea call to you<br/>like it calls to me?
Yes. The sea is all like,<br/>"Ted, come hang out."
I like Galactic President<br/>Superstar McAwesomeville.
You're coming on<br/>the boat sometime.
Stepping off.
Man, I wish me and my dad<br/>were as close as you guys are.
Oh. You want<br/>to make this personal?
Okay.
Destroy Ted Mosby.
Now it's personal.
No, if I wanted<br/>to make it personal,
I'd call you<br/>a bored little trophy wife
who likes to play activist
when the shops<br/>on 5th Avenue are closed.
You're going down.
Down where?<br/>To the yacht club?
Oh! I would love to.
W-w-wait.
I'm half Jewish,<br/>will that be a problem?
So what about becoming<br/>an environmental lawyer?
What about saving the world?
Wieners.
That was a great dream.
But we have a mortgage,<br/>and we're trying to have kids.
We're grown-ups now, Lily.
Wieners and gonads.
What would College You say
if he heard what<br/>you were saying right now?
Honestly? Probably<br/>something pretentious,
and pseudo-intellectual, like...
Boogers.
We all change, Lily.
You know, you don't spell<br/>"women" with a "Y" anymore.
And I'm okay with that.
And you need to be okay<br/>with the fact
that I may never become<br/>an environmental lawyer.
So how long have<br/>you felt this way?
Honestly?
Since my first day at GNB.
Hershey squirts.
Hey. How do you<br/>like my date's tux?
Ooh!
Uh, a-thank you!
Oh, none for him.<br/>He's stuffed.
Stuffed.
Oh! Zoey! There you are.
Oh, my God.
You have a monocle.
Is this real?
Is this really happening?<br/>Can you excuse us for a moment?
Let's go for a walk.
Good luck killing James Bond.
Are we allowed in here?
What do you want from me?
I want my crossword day back.
Okay? Go live your perfect<br/>little life,
and leave me the hell alone.
My life isn't perfect.
Oh, please,<br/>what's your biggest problem?
Having to sail<br/>back to the marina
because the Captain's<br/>all out of white Zin?
Oh. Great.<br/>Now you're crying.
Like that's going<br/>to get my sympathy.
It did.
You've known about this<br/>for two and a half years?
So every time you've
talked about wanting to be an<br/>environmental lawyer since then,
that was a lie.
Technically, I never lied.
You asked me questions,
and I responded<br/>with made-up words.
What?
So, you'll probably quit GNB<br/>in a couple years, right?
Affirmatootly.
And become<br/>an environmental lawyer?
Yepskerdoodles.
Hey, by the way,<br/>do you like this scarf?
Posititochadochmecochepopocha.
Lawyered.
Okay, that's also<br/>a made-up word.
Okay. Lily,<br/>what do you want from me?
I want you to be the person<br/>I fell in love with.
Niled it!
Excuse me.
Thank God you're here.
She's been messing<br/>with the exhibits.
I got married when I was 22
to a man who calls himself<br/>The Captain.
He seems like a good guy.
He wears those red pants.
I hate boats, Ted.
I do, I hate 'em.
I can't be on them.
I can't be near them.
I can't even think about them<br/>without getting seasick.
You want to know why I want<br/>to save that building?
Because when I look up<br/>at The Arcadian,
I see something big and solid,
and right now everything else<br/>in my life
just feels like I'm on a boat.
I know it's crazy to care<br/>that much about a building.
It's not crazy at all.
I'm the same way.
Look, Zoey,
The Arcadian should be<br/>a landmark, it should.
The lion head stonework<br/>is iconic.
I hate that we have<br/>to tear it down.
I hate working for GNB.
They're a bunch of wieners<br/>and gonads.
Ted, that was...
really easy.
What?
They're a<br/>bunch of wieners and gonads.
This should be useful.
And in that moment,
another headline appeared<br/>before my eyes.
You tricked me.
Well, it the bug room, Ted.
Your ass just got bugged.
Oh, the offer still stands.
We simply must have you out<br/>on the boat sometime.
Well, aren't you two clever.
Well, guess what,<br/>this museum has seen
every kind of prank<br/>you can think of.
Mummies playing poker,
penguins sticking<br/>out of volcanoes,
dinosaurs from<br/>the Cretaceous period
hanging out with dinosaurs<br/>from the Jurassic period.
One time a kid knocked down<br/>the blue whale.
You name it...
I'm sorry. Did you say someone<br/>knocked down the blue whale?
Oh no, not just someone.
A six-year-old.
Oh, yeah, that<br/>story is legend...
Hold on.
...dary.
And, um, would you<br/>happen to know
what that young man's name was?
No.
But I could,<br/>uh, check the files.
Thank you.
Now, Arthur, your turn.
I just sang three songs.
Now you-you do your part<br/>from Guys and Dolls.
Take your seats, everyone.
The show's about to start.
Douche.
So I hear my wife<br/>got you pretty good.
She caught me on<br/>tape trashing GNB.
Oh, that damn recorder.
Try being married to that.
"But you said you'd get the<br/>corgis neutered this weekend."
"I said no such thing."
"Oh, yeah?" Click.
You're a good guy,
Galactic President<br/>Superstar McAwesomeville.
Tell you what,<br/>when Zoey goes to sleep,
I'll find that tape<br/>and erase it for you.
No hard feelings.
Really?
You'd do that to your own wife?
Sure. Why not?
I mean, I'm glad she has<br/>these little causes,
they keep her out of trouble,
but when she throws<br/>a temper tantrum
and it gets in the way<br/>of someone doing their job,
that's a problem.
No, you know what?
Don't erase the tape.
And for what it's worth,
I don't think<br/>she's throwing temper tantrums.
I just think she's, you know,
standing up<br/>for what she believes in.
I respect that.
Hey, what about this?
I'll take you out<br/>on the boat sometime.
You've got to see this boat.
She's breathtaking.
Kids, there's an amazing<br/>architectural phenomenon
in the Natural History Museum.
If you stand in the right spot,
you can hear<br/>an entire conversation
all the way across the room.
July 23, 1981,
incident report.
At approximately 1000 hours,
No.<br/>...vandal dislodged
rib from triceratops skeleton...<br/>No...
...and flung said rib<br/>at giant whale.
No.
Causing said giant whale to fall<br/>in a downward trajectory.
No.<br/>And the vandal's name...
No.
Well, I'll be damned...<br/>Barney Stinson.
No! No!
Who's the master, Leroy?
Stinson was reprimanded
and returned to the custody<br/>of his father, Jerome Whittaker.
Uh, no, uncle.<br/>Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.
Uncle Jerry. Says father.<br/>Even signed it
and checked the box<br/>for father and everything.
Jerry's my uncle.
Lily?
Honey, what's wrong?
You okay?
Do you want a hit<br/>of this sandwich?
I want you.
Awesome. Let me just put<br/>a sock on the doorknob.
No. I mean, I want you
as opposed to who you've become.
You've changed so much.
What? How have I changed?
Did I cheat on you?
No.
Did I stop writing poems<br/>for you?
Yes, but I'm okay with that.
Am I not as good at making<br/>the sweet, sweet love to you?
Actually, you're way better now.
You last, like, two,<br/>three times as long.
You said that any longer<br/>would be too much.
It's okay. College Lily thinks<br/>those are orgasms.
No, it's...
it's none of that.
It's just this new Marshall...<br/>Corporate Marshall...
he wears suits
all the time.
He doesn't care about<br/>saving the world.
He's not you.
I want you back.
Well, you can't have me.
Look at the sign.
I'm extinct.
I've gone the way<br/>of Jane's Addiction.
Actually, Jane's Addiction<br/>got back together.
They did?
Yeah, they've done a few tours,<br/>they put out a new album.
Are you serious?!<br/>That is awesome!
Are they just as good?
Sure.
Look, I know that<br/>Corporate Marshall
wears a tie and everything,<br/>but it sounds like
he hasn't changed<br/>where it counts.
Hey.
Hi.
Look, Lily,
I know that you<br/>would have been okay
if we were poor and I was<br/>trying to save the world,
but will you still be okay
if I make a lot of money
and I spend all of it<br/>spoiling you and our kids?
We'll make it work.
There he goes.
The Marathon Man.
Mr. Stamina himself.
I can kiss better<br/>than that old man.
So when was the last<br/>time you saw him?
It was that day...
July 23, 1981.
My mom got pretty mad<br/>that he let me destroy
a New York City landmark.
Moms.
He never came around<br/>anymore after that.
Think he moved away.
Well, maybe the security guy<br/>had it wrong.
You never know...
But you do know, you do know.<br/>That's the thing. You know.
He's my dad.
Barney, do you want...?
I don't want to do anything.
Don't tell anyone<br/>about this, okay?
I'm serious.<br/>It's a great look.
I think it could come<br/>back, but one question.
Does it cost half<br/>as much as glasses?
Can I steal you for a second?
You don't need<br/>to worry. I...
What are you doing?
Oh, I thought we were...
Fine.
I erased the tape.
What?
I don't need it.
I'm going to beat<br/>you fair and square.
Thanks.
But it's good to know
how easily you can be<br/>manipulated by a woman.
You look gross when<br/>you cry, you know that?
Some women look cute.
You look like a basset hound.
Oh, laugh it up now.
Because starting Monday,
I got you in my crosshairs.
Bring it on, Princess.
Eriksen...
It's, uh, 3:00 a.m.
You know what, you might<br/>as well not even go home.
And so Marshall stayed right on<br/>at Goliath National Bank.
Of course,<br/>it wouldn't last forever.
But that's another story.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">NARRATOR: Kids, in the<br/>fall of 2010, it seemed like
Aunt Lily could only talk<br/>about one thing: babies.
Oh, God, I have been<br/>craving this burger all day.
Do you know<br/>what plays a huge role
in helping a woman<br/>conceive? Hmm.
Cervical mucus.
(gagging)
Oh, my God, I can't wait<br/>to see this movie.
I hear it's really scary.
Oh, change of plans.
I thought violent<br/>images wouldn't be good
for my future fetus,
so instead, I rented this<br/>video of a live water birth.
(splashing on TV)
(screaming)
They don't know<br/>what it is.
It just showed up<br/>on my mom's X-ray.
Look at this crib.
NARRATOR: But all in<br/>all, it wasn't a problem.
That is, until the night<br/>of Barney's boutonniere.
MARSHALL:<br/>Oh, you're wearing a flower.
Thank you.
Ah, didn't compliment. Just<br/>observed. BARNEY: I know.
Isn't it? Why are<br/>you wearing that?
Why does Barney<br/>do anything ever?
Exactly. Science.
There is an 83% correlation
between the times<br/>men wear boutonnieres
and the times<br/>they get laid. Hmm.
Think about it.
Proms, weddings.
Mm-hmm.
Grandmas' funerals.
Thanks for<br/>the redhead, Nana.
The "everyday boutonniere"<br/>by Stinson.
And nope.
I'm sorry, Barney, but<br/>no girl is going home
with a guy with a<br/>flower on his chest.
Unless he's a clown, and<br/>she's in the trunk of his car.
Along with 50 other clowns.
(laughing)
It's a clown car.<br/>Oh.
Robin, did you know
that boutonniere is French<br/>for "bootie is near?"
Hmm.
True story.
Une histoire vraie.
Hmm! Did you know<br/>that Barney is French
for "sad little guy who works<br/>way too hard to get laid""
Woman, you best<br/>check yourself.
Yeah, on the bright side,
I guess suits are pretty<br/>boring without them, so...
(gasps) Madam...
that is an insult that<br/>cannot be borne!
I demand satisfaction!
What, are we gonna duel?
No. I'm going to show everyone<br/>this embarrassing video of you.
It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!
(all screaming and yelling)
NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, by this point, we knew
Aunt Robin had been a teen pop<br/>sensation
in Canada,<br/>known as Robin Sparkles.
And we also knew that<br/>her Robin Sparkles character
came from a Canadian TV show,
which we'd never seen...<br/>until now.
I cannot wait to see<br/>what's on this DVD!
Oh, you haven't watched it yet?
No, of course not.
I wanted my first time to be<br/>with someone I cared about.
LILY: Sweet! I get<br/>that a lot. Well, once.
Hey, Robin,<br/>do you want
to go get a Korean massage<br/>on Saturday?
Oh, I'd love to.
I've got this knot in my neck<br/>that's so annoying.
Yeah, I figured<br/>I should get one now
because once I get pregnant,<br/>no more massages.
Just so annoying.
Okay.
(upbeat music plays on TV)
Space Teens?!
Is this a porno?
No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet!
It's a kids' show.
Oh.
MEN:<br/>Yeah! Yeah!
TED:<br/>I don't know.
This does have all<br/>the earmarks of porn.
Stripper pole,<br/>bad lighting,
delusional girl<br/>who thinks
it's a stepping stone<br/>to mainstream success.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old<br/>bowl of pornflakes.
BARNEY:<br/>Whoa! And who is this
exquisite keytarist I assume
you're about<br/>to make sweet love to?
Oh, that's Jessica Glitter.
She was my BFF on the show<br/>and in real life.
Ah, BFFs.
Did you guys have sleepovers?
Get mad at each other<br/>and wrestle,
but then end up kissing<br/>in a tender embrace?
Here, show us on Lily.<br/>Barney, you know what?
If you're going<br/>to be disgusting,
we're not watching this, okay?
Yeah. Come on, Barney.
It's just a cute<br/>little story about...
What exactly is this about?
Oh, two average<br/>Canadian teenagers
who solve crimes<br/>in space using math.
That sounds ridiculous.
So sue me.
Like the producers of<br/>Milky Way Mathletes tried to.
(synthesizer<br/>and drum music playing)
(both giggling)
Great job using<br/>long division
to catch that<br/>space burglar, eh?
Well, what can I say?
He'll be in galactic jail<br/>for the remainder of his life.
(robot trilling)
Sparkles, Glitter,
we're about<br/>to enter an asteroid belt, eh.
(gasps)
Brace for turbulence!
BOTH:<br/>Oh. Oh.
LILY: I have to say,<br/>as much as I hate
to agree with Barney,
this does seem to be<br/>a veritable pornucopia.
Okay, guys, come on.
It's a kids' show!
Like Electric Company<br/>or Sesame Street or, um...
You can't do that<br/>on television.
Exactly.
No.
You can't do that on television!
♪ ♪
TED:<br/>Robin,
this show is so dirty, I<br/>don't know whether to hug you
or run a shower for you<br/>so you can sit there alone,
crying and clenching<br/>your knees.
It's just bad camera work, okay?
Wayne, our camera guy--<br/>he wasn't that great.
I don't know. I think<br/>he did a pretty good job,
considering he was probably<br/>only using one hand.
(laughter)
You know what?
I feel bad for you Americans,<br/>that you can look
at this wondrous and educational<br/>adventure through space,
and see something obscene.
Can you just please try<br/>to look at this
with the innocence of a child?
Innocence of a child.<br/>Innocence of a child.
Coming up.<br/>Here we go.
Girls, if you want
to get through the asteroid<br/>belt, you've got
to use<br/>multiplication.
To the joystick!
Okay, Space Teens,<br/>let's multiply!
Five times six?
Oh. 30.
Yes!<br/>Oh!
Seven times four?
GLITTER: 28! Keep going!
Eight times nine?
72!
Don't stop now!<br/>Almost there!
23 times three?
Oh...
(all protesting)<br/>I'm sorry.
We got to ration this.
It's like<br/>we're on a desert island,
and this video<br/>is a really hot, naked chick,
and she's got, like, seaweed<br/>on her and a seashell bra.
You all feel me?
Hey,
if you and Jessica are BFFs,
how come we've never met her?
Okay, well,<br/>it was a long time ago, okay?
I get a Christmas card<br/>from her every year,
but we're not really friends<br/>anymore.
But BFFs are forever.
MARSHALL:<br/>Oh, come on, Lily.
Nobody stays friends<br/>with their high school friends.
I'm still friends<br/>with Punchy.
Dude, he lives in Cleveland.
You see him once a year,<br/>at which point,
he punches you really hard<br/>in the arm
and tells everyone<br/>how you dookied your pants.
I know, on paper<br/>he sounds great,
but you guys<br/>aren't really friends.
Look, I may not see him a lot,<br/>but it doesn't matter.
Observe.
(phone ringing)
Schmosby!<br/>Punchy!
Schmosby!<br/>Punchy!
(high-pitched):<br/>Schmosby! Punchy!
Schmoosby!<br/>Punchy!
Hey, good talking to you, Ted.
Yeah, you, too.<br/>If you're ever in New York.
Definitely.
We are just two peas.
I don't get it.
How can you and Glitter just<br/>stop being friends?
Best friends don't do that.
Well, we did, okay?<br/>And I haven't talked to her
in, like, five years,<br/>so just drop it.
I got to go.
Whoa.
What do you think came<br/>between Robin and Jessica?
TED:<br/>Much like our friends,
the Space Teens,
I think I can<br/>solve this crime with math.
Okay... Okay, here<br/>is a Christmas card
that Jessica sent Robin.
Lily, how old would you say<br/>that kid is?
Four years, three months.
Which means Jessica got pregnant<br/>five years ago.
Right around the time she<br/>and Robin stopped being friends.
Of course. Robin hates kids.
The last thing<br/>she would want to do
is hang out<br/>with some little brat.
Thus, if I may...
(clears throat)
When Glitter's womb<br/>a fruit did bear,
Robin said, "To hell with this,<br/>I'm outta hare."
Glitter got pregnant,<br/>so Robin dumped her.
Oh.<br/>Oh, got... Wow.
That's got to be it, right, Lil?
Lil?
Robin's gonna dump me!
Oh, sweetheart.
Aha.
When a second uterus<br/>plumped becomes...
Dude.
Feel the room.
(sighs)
No.<br/>We've been waiting all day!
Just watch it without me.
Two dudes on the couch<br/>together watching porn?
That's kind of weird.
Okay, it's not porn,<br/>it's a kids' show.
Two dudes watching<br/>a kids' show might be worse.
(sighs)
Okay, fine,<br/>I'll watch it with you.
Yeah! (giggles)<br/>But if either of you
makes even one peep<br/>about the show being dirty,
I'm turning it off.
We...<br/>I'm serious.
(sighs)
Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?
Great.
How's your beaver?
Busy as ever!
(stifled laughter)
Our characters<br/>had pet beavers.
(giggles)<br/>Sure.
The beaver is the official<br/>animal of Canada.
(stifled laughter)
It's our national mascot.
It's a noble creature.
Okay, girls.
Everyone knows a beaver's<br/>favorite food is wood.
I just hope<br/>we brought along enough of it
for our three-day<br/>galactic space journey.
So let's do the math.
If Robin's beaver devours
six inches of wood<br/>every half hour,
and Jessica's beaver
devours eight inches<br/>of wood every 45 minutes,
how much wood will I need
to keep both of these beavers<br/>well-fed all weekend long?
(Ted and Barney<br/>burst out laughing)
ROBIN:<br/>While you figure it out at home,
how about we sing you a song<br/>about our beavers?
(upbeat song plays)
BOTH:<br/>Hey!
No! You don't get<br/>to hear the beaver song!
It is a sweet song<br/>about friendship,
and you guys are being<br/>disgusting,
and beavers are adorable!
No arguments here.
(knocking on door)
'Sup Shmosby!
Punchy, what are<br/>you doing here?
Well, yesterday you said<br/>if I was ever in New York.
'Sup, turds?
(groans)
Okay, uh, uh, where<br/>are you staying?
In your mom's pants.
Trick. She's old.
Hey, don't worry
about me.<br/>I'm cool on the couch.
Whoa. He's staying here?<br/>You're staying here?
I know! It's so good, right?
Feel like you're dreaming?
But check your totem, brah.
Punchy's here in the flesh.
So, why don't we get<br/>one of these, Ted?
Yeah. Remember these?
High school?<br/>Junior high? Yeah.
Elementary school?<br/>Remember those?
Look, look, Punchy's<br/>here. Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Schmosby, remember<br/>when you dookied
in your pants<br/>down by the lake?
Unbelievable!<br/>(grunts)
Hey, Schmosby, remember<br/>when you dookied on our couch
in the form of your idiot<br/>high school friend?
(laughs)
Unbelievable!
Come on. I worry about the guy.
He's had the same dead-end job
at a car rental place<br/>for 15 years.
Don't care.
He's been stuck in Cleveland
his whole life.<br/>Get a hotel.
Robin...
LeBron.
(sighs)<br/>Okay, one night.
Got to go.
Hey.
Where are you going?<br/>We just got here.
Oh, a Korean massage.
By yourself?
Well, I figured<br/>you'd be busy,
reading What to Expect When<br/>You're Expecting to Expect.
Guys, did you see that?
She's going to a Korean<br/>massage without me.
That's our thing.
I'm telling you,<br/>she's gonna dump me,
just like she<br/>dumped Glitter.
Lily, come on. We don't even<br/>know that's what happened.
Um, hello, somebody<br/>already solved that crime
using math, remember?
Look, Lily.
Robin is clearly<br/>getting tired
of you constantly<br/>talking about babies.
I don't.<br/>(men groan)
Lily, how old am I?<br/>384 months.
Busted!
Okay. So before you Lily<br/>all over the place,
maybe you should try<br/>hanging out with Robin
and not talking<br/>about babies.
So Lily did just that.
She tried not<br/>to talk about babies.
Hey, Lily, what brings you<br/>to the crib?
(whines)<br/>Crib...
What's the matter?<br/>You look rattled.
Rattled?<br/>(groans)
I want to talk about babies.<br/>What?
Look, I know you<br/>don't care about this stuff,
but I'm about<br/>to become a mother.
And as a future mother,
I'm gonna need<br/>the support...
Oh, my God!<br/>You're not even pregnant yet.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that a fertilized egg<br/>has not yet attached itself
to the lining<br/>of your uterine wall.
You see?<br/>I read your Facebook updates.
God, it's like it's all<br/>you ever talk about, Lily,
and I'm sick of it!
Well, guess what?<br/>I've got some good news.
When that baby comes,<br/>you don't have to see it.
In fact,<br/>you don't have to see me.
This whole friendship thing?<br/>Done.
Great.<br/>Great.
For crying out loud.
You broke up with Robin?
I had to.<br/>We were growing apart,
and we're better off<br/>without each other.
Okay, Lily, you sound about<br/>as convincing as you did
the time you<br/>"accidentally" shredded
my Joey Buttafuoco pants.
No!
Get on the phone, call<br/>Robin and fix this.
I can't.<br/>The damage is done.
(sobbing)
Can you just hold me?
You know what? No.
I don't agree<br/>with what you did,
and so I refuse<br/>to comfort you,
despite how adorable<br/>you are when you cry.
Okay.
Okay. Maybe just one cuddle,<br/>but then that is it.
Times Square's the bomb!
I got so many great pictures<br/>of all the billboards.
Yeah. You know,
there's more to New York<br/>than Times Square.
There's the Village, the Lower<br/>East Side, Central Park...
They got better billboards<br/>then the ones in Times Square?
No.
Times Square's the bomb!
Here. You know what?<br/>Hold this, okay?
I'm going<br/>to go pee in the jar
I got going<br/>in the alley.
(huffs)
Seriously, dude,<br/>he has got to go.
You need to be like,
(as Anne Robinson): "You are<br/>the weakest link. Goodbye."
(as Jeff Probst):<br/>Punchy, the tribe has spoken.
(as Padma Lakshmi): Please<br/>pack up your knives and go.
(as China Chow):<br/>Your work of art
didn't work for us.
(as Flavor Flav):<br/>Your time's up.
(as Mike Richards):<br/>I have to ask you
to leave the mansion.
(as Alex McLeod):<br/>You must leave the chateau.
(as Bret Michaels):<br/>Your tour ends here.
(as Ted Allen):<br/>You've been chopped.
Okay, yeah. I know.
(as Julie Chen):<br/>You've been evicted
from the Big Brother house.
(as Gail Simmons): Your<br/>dessert just didn't measure up.
(as RuPaul):<br/>Sashay away.
(as Gordon Ramsay):<br/>Give me your jacket
and leave Hell's Kitchen.
(as Chris Harrison): I'm<br/>sorry, you did not get a rose.
(as Phil Keoghan): You have<br/>been eliminated from the race.
(as Tyra Banks):<br/>You are no longer in the running
to be<br/>America's Next Top Model.
(as Donald Trump):<br/>You're fired.
(as Heidi Klum):<br/>Auf Wiedersehen.
Ted, come look at this.
I found a little wounded bird<br/>in the alley.
That's your scrotum.
(laughing)
You know what it is, Ted.<br/>You know what it is.
Come on, Ted.<br/>You always fall for that.
Yeah, he's gotta go.
(crowd cheering)
What are we doing<br/>in Madison Square Garden?
Okay, you refused<br/>to talk to Robin.
So I thought that you<br/>might like to talk to...
the organist for<br/>the New York Rangers.
(organ playing jaunty tune)
Jessica Glitter?!
(organ playing)
How did you find<br/>Glitter?
Simple, really.
I used my powers of deduction.
You see, I knew Glitter<br/>used to be a keytarist,
which is basically a piano,
so I just made a list of all<br/>the keyboard-based occupations
and then I cross-matched them...
His friend Barney looked me up,
hoping to buy my<br/>Space Teens costume.
Yo, Glitter...
Be cool.
So, is this the one who's<br/>best friends with Robin now?
(groans)<br/>More like ex-best friends.
Just like you.
(plays "The Chicken Dance")<br/>I'm sorry to hear that.
I miss Robin.
Yeah, well, Marshall and I<br/>are about to get pregnant,
and I know she<br/>stopped being friends
with you when you<br/>had a baby, so...
Oh, Robin didn't stop<br/>being friends with me.
I stopped being friends<br/>with her.
What? Why?
Because I had a baby.
Honey, when you have a baby,
all that best friend stuff--
hockey,<br/>bow hunting for caribou, math--
that all goes out the window.
I mean, I tried<br/>to stay friends with her,
but it just didn't happen.
She took it pretty hard.
I even thought she might try<br/>to kill herself.
(plays "Charge!")
ALL:<br/>Charge!
Wow. You dumped her<br/>just because you had a baby?
That's cold.
Didn't you do the same thing?
Minus the baby?
Oh, God.
I gotta go.
I gotta go apologize<br/>to Robin.
I- I need to tell her I love her,
and that she'll always<br/>be a priority.
Be careful, Lily.
I made those<br/>promises, too.
And now I haven't even talked<br/>to her in five years.
Sure, I thought<br/>about picking up the phone
and calling her<br/>a hundred times,
but I just never have<br/>the courage to actually...
(playing "Chopsticks"<br/>on the organ)
Hey.
Go ahead.
(plays note)
Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck<br/>and Little John out here?
Punchy, it's time to go back.
Back to Times Square?!
Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.
I don't know<br/>if I can do that, bro.
I mean, yeah,<br/>I've been jonesing for a piece
of Cleveland-style pizza,
but I feel bad<br/>about leaving you out here.
I worry about you, Ted.
(scoffs)
You worry about me?
Yeah.
The other day,<br/>when you called...
Schmosby!<br/>Punchy!
Hey, good talking to you, Ted.
Yeah. You, too.<br/>If you're ever in New York...
Definitely.
(phone beeps off, Punchy sighs)
Sweetie, who was that?
It was my friend Ted.
He sounded<br/>kind of depressed.
Is this the Ted who<br/>got left at the altar?
Yeah.
He's not doing so good.
Poor guy lives in<br/>a tiny apartment in New York,
nowhere near Times Square.
He's got no family around.
He's still single,<br/>doesn't have a backyard.
It's just a bummer.
Maybe you should go visit him.<br/>Cheer him up a little.
You know,<br/>buy him some shots,
do the whole wounded<br/>bird trick.
You think that would work?
Worked on me.
Wow.
She sounds<br/>pretty great, Punchy.
She's my angel.
In fact, uh...
We're getting married.
Wow! Wow!
That's--<br/>I'm-I'm really happy for you.
Thanks, Ted. Thanks.
Actually, that's the other<br/>reason why I came out here.
I wanted to see<br/>if you'd be my best man.
Of course I will.
Yeah! That's great!<br/>No, you're stupid.
Dawg pound.
Oh, that's it...
NARRATOR: That night,<br/>Lily went to the one place
she knew she could find Robin--
New York's premiere Canadian<br/>bar, the Hoser Hut.
Oh, there you are.
Robin, I owe you a huge apology.
No, okay? Me first.
I've been pulling away from you,<br/>and I'm sorry.
It's just, the last time<br/>my best friend had a baby--
I know.<br/>I know all about it.
It's not gonna happen<br/>with you and me.
And I'm sorry
I've been going crazy<br/>with this baby stuff.
I know you hate babies.
Whoa.
Look, I hate most babies.
But your baby?
I'm gonna love<br/>that kid so much.
I'm gonna pick it up<br/>and everything.
Oh...
GUYS:<br/>Aww.
I'm so happy<br/>you guys made up.
Me, too.
(song plays)
Where do I know<br/>this song from?
Oh, my God.<br/>It's the beaver song.
Okay, which one<br/>of you put this on?
GLITTER:<br/>♪ Hey, beaver, come on ♪
♪ When you feel alone ♪
♪ Just pick up that phone ♪
♪ And I'll be there<br/>to share my ♪
ROBIN AND GLITTER:<br/>♪ Ice cream cone ♪
♪ We'll lick it side by side ♪
Wow. This is<br/>so dirty.
Come on, Barney.
It's a sweet song<br/>about friendship.
Yeah, dude,<br/>come on.
♪ Day is done ♪
(laughs)
♪ Two beavers<br/>are better than one ♪

[<div class="full-script"> Kids, in the fall of 2010,
I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving.
And I wanted it to be unforgettable.
Instead of stuffing,<br/>I'm going to fill the turkey with...
a slightly smaller turkey.
It's called a Turturkeykey!
A Turturkeykey? Mm-hmm.
Uh-uh, oh-oh. ROBIN: Yeah, I was there for
the "insertion." He used shoehorns.
I'll be having sides.
Your loss. All right, it's dead in here.
I'm gonna call it a little early.
What? No! You can't go now.
It's the night before Thanksgiving.
College chicks are back in town.
Their moms just made a snide comment
about the weight they gained.
They called her a bitch,
but deep down, they know she's right.
And they're about to walk through that door,
where we will be waiting
with some light beer and<br/>some rock hard approval.
Wh-what u-up?
Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man.
You could become The Blitz.
Blitz was a guy we knew in college.
Sadly, he was cursed.
Well...
I'm calling it a little early.
Wh... you sure? We got big plans.
Yeah. Remember how last<br/>week we fired up a sandwich,
and we listened to Pink Floyd's<br/>Dark Side of the Moon
while watching The Wizard of Oz?
Well, tonight,
we're doing the same thing,
only with "Weird Al"<br/>Yankovic's Greatest Hits
and Apocalypse Now.
We'll see what happens.
Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night:<br/>mac and cheese and Tomb Raider.
Biz-zow!
You see, every time Blitz left a place,
something amazing happened.
Oh! I'm sorry.
I thought this was my room.
Completely naked! Completely naked!
Aw, man!
And the movie was awesome.
Aw, man!
At the exact moment Brando first appeared,
"Weird Al" launched right into "Eat It."
Aw, man!
And over the years,
"The Curse of The Blitz" continued.
Well, I'm gonna call it.
I just got Madden 2K1,<br/>and I can't stop thinking about it.
See you later! Bye-bye!
All right, bye-bye! Okay, later!
Good-bye! Bye-Bye!
Tap's broke! Can't turn 'em off!
Free beer for everyone!
Free beer for everyone!
Free beer for everyone!
Aw, man!
You know what?
Ted, go ahead-- leave early<br/>to do something lame.
Just don't blame us if<br/>you become... The Blitz.
All right, first of all...
there's nothing lame about<br/>brining a Turturkeykey,
copyright pending. And secondly,
I don't believe<br/>"The Curse of The Blitz" is real.
Kids, I'd live to regret those words.
You see, the "Curse of Blitz"<br/>could be passed
from one person to the next, at any moment.
Blitz had gotten the curse<br/>from Jerry Windheim,
back in freshman year,<br/>who got it years before that
from Davey Beaterman.
The original Blitz, Matt Blitz,
was a guy who went to Wesleyan<br/>back in the '60s.
He dropped out right before<br/>the school went co-ed.
And then, Thanksgiving morning...
What the hell happened here?
Hey! Morning, Blitz!
Aw, man!
No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay?
I am not The Blitz.
* My Blitzy lies over the ocean *
* My Blitzy lies over the sea *
* My Blitzy lies over the ocean *
* So bring back my Blitzy... * Please stop.
Okay, fine.
*...To me. *
The Gentleman!
THE GROUP: The Gentleman! Wait! Wait! Wait!
What's that? What's "The Gentleman"?
Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.
I'm not The Blitz!
Zoey?
Morning, Blitz!
Kids, you remember Zoey.
For the last two months,
she'd been making my life hell.
Thanks, guys!
Last night was amazing!
The Gentleman!
The Gentle...
How could you, my best friends in the world,
hang out with my mortal enemy,
then let her sleep in the<br/>tub where I clean myself?!
Sorry, Ted. We can explain.
After you Blitzed out last night...
I'm not The Blitz!
Oh, my God...
That's Zoey!
That's Ted's enemy.
Which means she's our enemy.
Let's take this bitch down.
Huh? Huh?
Who's got your back?
Now let's have dinner!
Finish the story, Red.
Okay, well, we all started brainstorming
ways to mess with her.
There were a lot of different<br/>ideas kicking around.
And then I'm just going to<br/>leave her there... buck-naked,
covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.
Barney, I know that Ted<br/>doesn't like that girl,
but that's a little extreme.
Wait-- Ted doesn't like that girl?
Okay. Wh...?
Well, I got it.
You see that silk scarf?
I'm going to steal it.
Can I... help you?
Yeah. Yeah!
My name is Lily Aldrin.
I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's,<br/>so you better...
You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!
Well, yeah.
You're amazing!
I bought a bunch of your paintings online.
That was you?! Yeah.
Oh! Thanks!
Look, none of us meant for<br/>it to happen, but, well,
we had an awesome night with her.
The Gentleman!
And then, the craziest thing happened.
I missed a skateboarding dog?
Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.
It wasn't?
Okay, Marshall.
Truth or dare?
Okay, awesome.
Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths.
So, dare.
Okay.
I dare you to send a picture of your junk
to a complete stranger.
Best idea ever!
Worst idea ever!
My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket.
If there phone was on vibrate,<br/>I basically dry-humped them.
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Whoa! Yay!
Yeah. Okay.
Everybody shout out random numbers.
Um. 4, 8...
15, 16, 23, 42!
And... send!
Wait. Blitz was there, too?
The Gentleman! The Gentleman!
Oh, I was there for the whole thing.
Something inside me just said
"Grand Theft Auto" can wait a night.
It was legen--
wait for Ted to leave,<br/>'cause he's now The Blitz--
-- dary. Legendary!
I'm not The Blitz!
I'm afraid you are, Ted.
You see, when you left last night,
you changed the course of Blitztory.
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Blitz...
I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea
what I've missed all these years:
The university president's toupee
being snatched by a hawk at graduation,
Zeppelin reuniting at my<br/>cousin Ira's bar mitzvah,
countless nip-slips, crotch shots,
shooting stars and double rainbows.
I've missed them all!
Well, not anymore, Blitz.
My name's not Blitz.
My name is Steve!
Colors seem so bright now.
Thank you, Blitz. What? No!
N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz!
The only thing I missed last<br/>night was my best friends
stabbing me in the back by<br/>hanging out with my worst enemy.
Guys!
I hate Zoey!
That means you're supposed to hate her, too!
Th-that's your rule, Lily!
I tried.
Tried?!
Lily, do you have any idea
how many people I've blindly hated for you?
I hated Renée Zellweger<br/>with a burning passion
for eight years,
only to discover you<br/>meant Reese Witherspoon!
Hey, I will hate her<br/>until I get my money back
for You, Me and Dupree!
That's Kate Hudson!
Oh, yeah. That's who I hate.
Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.
No, we hate Zoey!
I'm so furious at you all right now,
but it's Thanksgiving,<br/>and I have a Turturkeykey to make.
And not that I'm The Blitz,
but could everyone please<br/>come with me into the kitchen?
Okay, I'm, uh,
just gonna preheat the oven.
The oven.
Hey, Robin,
you should dance on the oven.
Make out with Zoey!
Make out with Zoey! Make out...
Did they tell you about<br/>the skateboarding dog?
It was awesome!
Great. So not only did you guys betray me,
but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?
Full disclosure.
We also used all your butter,<br/>greasing up Lily
We also used all your butter,<br/>greasing up Lily
so we could see how far we<br/>could slide her down the hall.
But if it helps, I reached 4G.
It doesn't help. 4G?
Mm-hmm.
No.
What-What are we supposed to do now?
This is awesome!
I'm part of this!
Barney, I don't know
if the oven is deep enough. Plus,
it's a display made of cardboard.
Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.
Hey, just so you guys know,
there was a tiny explosion<br/>at the sewage treatment plant
across the street from our apartment,
but I'm sure it's fine by now.
This is awesome!
It's not awesome!
I think the smaller turkey just tried
to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.
Um...
Um... I'm have...
I'm having trouble breathing!
Mom keeps an extra litter box in here.
There you go.
Good as new.
Oh. Hey, Ginger.
Ted, you're not gonna like this,
but we do have one other option.
Hey, you guys
should come to my house for Thanksgiving.
My husband always spends<br/>it with his daughter,
so I'm going to be alone anyway.
Could we bring Ted?
It's Thanksgiving.
What the hell?
No. Absolutely not.
Come on. Give her a chance.
Ted, you violated a dead turkey
with another dead turkey.
Don't let that be in vain.
Guys? Wait a minute.
Where's Barney?
And here's the twist, Babaka.
Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz!
But Barney, now you left the group.
Wouldn't that put you in danger<br/>of becoming The Blitz yourself?
No. I c...
Because...
Step on it.
You missed it.
Oh, my goodness.
Our cab took a wrong turn.
We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike<br/>and he sang "Twist and Shout!"
But he's The Blitz.
No. I'm not The Blitz.
I'm The Bueller.
You know what this means.
You're The Blitz.
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Blitz...
Oh, God, no!
Life moves pretty fast, Barney.
If you don't stop and look<br/>around once in a while,
you might miss it.
Chicka-chicka!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Ted.
Zoey.
Best friend alert!
Okay, the Turturkeykey<br/>is officially cooking.
Oh, God, that is disgusting!
Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.
No... no, Ted.
Random number guy just<br/>sent me his wang back.
Wow.
You sent a wang out,<br/>and you got a wang back.
It's a boom-a-wang.
Nice. Thank you.
No, I meant the wang.
Barney, could you get me some more ice?
Sure.
But... no one move while I'm gone.
I'm scared.
You're safe.
It's okay to leave the room.
You have to actually leave the building
for something cool to happen.
Thanks.
You're the only one who's<br/>nice to me about this.
Okay, I got to test this.
What happened?
You missed it!
Dude, you walked out of the room,
the laws of physics stopped and<br/>the laws of awesome tripled.
Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!
I just wanted to see something cool happen.
I'm sorry.
But I was on that island for<br/>what seems like eternity.
I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.
No! Y-You...
Robin, Robin.
I will pay you to be The Blitz.
$100! No-- $10,000.
No-- 60 bucks.
That's a lot of money for someone like you.
Dude, The Blitz isn't something<br/>that can be bought or sold.
Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.
Oh, what was that?
I was distracted by the four-caret diamond
your 53-year-old husband bought you.
Facial!
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a turturkeykey to baste.
I'm coming with you.
No... I baste alone.
Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.
Word play. Loving it.
But relax.
I've got a ton of sides
to heat up since my plans fell through.
Who canceled? Your coven?
Coven. Group of witches. Boom.
Yeah. They were worn out from<br/>putting that spell on your hair.
Oh! Serve returned.
Are you happy?
You're ruining Thanksgiving.
Well, you're not exactly who I thought
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.
God, I'm so happy to be here.
My face hurts from smiling.
Oh... I'm sorry, Lily.
I'm just never going to like that woman.
Ted, give her a chance.
Enemies can't become friends.
Yes, they can.
Right, guys?
No, no, no. You guys can't be objective.
You still feel guilty about last night.
Well, let's get an outside opinion.
Who are we gonna--
"Dear Wang Guy..." Oh.
"Can enemies ever be friends?
Just wondering."
Really?
Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?
He's bold and uninhibited,
so why not?
And guys, you know what? For fun,<br/>why don't we ask him
what he does for a living?
Wouldn't that be fun?
Just ask... Aww.
You've got a little crush<br/>on Wang Guy, don't you?
What? No. Shut up.
I hate him.
Oh, look.
We got an answer. Here it is.
"Yes, enemies can become friends.
"Remember what Gandhi said.
'Be the change you want<br/>to see in the world.'"
Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?
That is amazing.
And I was here for it.
Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha!
Burn on her.
Come on, man.
Don't be that Blitz.
I'm not any Blitz!
You're The Blitz!
You're all The Blitz!
I slept with that cute<br/>Indian girl who cuts my hair!
What does that have to do with anything?
Nothing! I just forgot
to brag about it before!
Guys, despite the wit<br/>and wisdom of Wang Guy,
Zoey and I are never going to be friends.
We're just here for her oven and that's it.
Whoa! Oh, my God!
Did you do that on purpose?
What? No. It was an accident.
Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.
Oh, great. Real mature.
Yeah, well, you started it.
Just stop it!
God, can't you two just<br/>stop fighting for one day?
Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote
clocked out and had a beer together?
Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry<br/>shared a cup of coffee.
Lily, those are cartoon characters,
and I'm pretty sure<br/>you're making up episodes.
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
Oh, get out.
All of you, out!
But it's Thanksgiving.
And I'm a part of it.
Out!
Wait... Where's Barney?
Hey, guys, the most amazing<br/>thing just happened
to me in that other roo...
Aw, man.
I don't get it. Why'd she just
I don't get it. Why'd she just
kick us out like that?
And then the cab driver said
the last thing any of us wanted to hear.
Where to?
I guess we're going home.
Yeah. I don't know where that is.
Lily, where'd you get that?
Oh.
When Zoey booted us,
it made me want to steal<br/>something of hers again.
Apartment full of designer labels,<br/>and what do I grab?
"Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."
I wonder who Hannah is.
Hey, you guys should come to<br/>my house for Thanksgiving.
My husband always
spends it with his daughter,
so I'm going to be alone, anyway.
Well, you're not exactly who I thought
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
Get out!
All of you, out!
We have to go back to Zoey's.
You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.
Oh, God.
What are you doing here?
Barney let us in.
Barney was here?
I was walking around half-naked.
Aw, man!
Wait. Which half?
Look, I'm sorry your<br/>stepdaughter didn't want
to spend Thanksgiving with you.
How do you know that?
I just do.
It must be tough.
It was the first Thanksgiving<br/>Hannah agreed to spend with me,
and then at the last minute,<br/>she changed her mind.
She hates my guts.
I get that.
Uh, you should hang on to this.
You can give it to her next year.
Yeah...
Right.
Next year.
Hey, you never know.
People don't stay enemies forever.
And that's the story of how<br/>Zoey and I became friends.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Before we eat,
we should take a group picture
and send it to Wang Guy.
Ooh. Oh. Great idea.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey
I have ever seen.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes
as good as it looks.
It didn't.
It tasted wrong.
Oops. We forgot to light the candles.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
And just as Barney looked away,
it happened.
The Gentleman!
What happened? I saw it!
Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad.
Aw, man.
Oh, go ahead.
I forgot my jacket.
Oh, hold the door!
Thank you, God!
Aw, man!
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Blitz.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the winter of 2010,
we had a new addition to our<br/>little group-- Zoey.
Zoey was married to... The Captain.
Boys! Great to see you!
Looking smart.
Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?
Okay.
That man is terrifying.
Everything he said was nice,<br/>but I am profoundly scared.
Keep smiling. He can still see us.
There was just something about him.
We couldn't put our finger on it until...
I figured it out!
I know what's so creepy about The Captain.
Okay.
Yeah.
I snapped this photo of him
last time he dropped off Zoey.
Observe.
The bottom half of his face... is smiling.
Oh. Look, he seems happy.
Seems like a nice guy.
But the top half of his face...
...wants to murder you!
Cheerful.
Wants to murder you.
No. Cheerful.
Wants to murder you.
Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question.
Captain, what do you think of ice cream?
Oh, he loves it!
Captain, what do you think of rainy days?
Whoa, he hates them.
Captain, quick question:
How do you feel about<br/>the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh.
What-What is that?
I don't get it. I don't get it.
He hates that he loves them.
Ah!
Captioning sponsored by<br/>20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION,
CBS
and TOYOTA.
Great. Okay.
Hey, guys, Zoey just told me
about this great Frank Lloyd<br/>Wright retrospective tonight.
Who's in?
Sorry, I'm, uh, I...
I- I don't know, washing my hair.
Running the water.
Holding the towel.
And I'll be home
trying to get over the fact
that no one invited me to<br/>the big hair washing party.
All right, fine.<br/>Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.
Oh, wait. Just the two of you?
Tread lightly, Mosby.
Any time
a single guy hangs out
with a married woman,
there are rules that must be followed.
Rule number one...
Don't use the husband's condoms.
That's just rude.
Rule number one:
don't go anywhere that has candles.
Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel
about Ted and Zoey having an<br/>intimate chat by candlelight?
Mm-hmm...
It'll be the last dinner they ever have.
Rule number two:
No sharing food. Hmm.
In fact, anything involving<br/>saliva is off-limits.
Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.
Well, if I can't share her lipstick,
there's really no point in even going.
And the most important rule of all...
Lubricant is public property.
Please.
No lying to the spouse
about anything you do.
Why would anyone lie?
Look, Zoey and I are just friends.
If there was anything more than that,
I wouldn't hang out with her.
Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married,
it's very hard to be friends
with a single person of the<br/>opposite sex. ROBIN: Yeah.
Unless you're old friends, which is why
I can hang out with<br/>Marshall whenever I want.
Right, Marsh Madness?
No doubt, Robo Cop.
You two never hang out alone.
You just made up those nicknames right now.
I guess it's true.
You and I never really hang out alone.
Well, let's. Let's have dinner together,<br/>just the two of us.
Oh! Sweet.
No candles.
No candles.
Lily, I guess that leaves<br/>just you and me. Want to hang?
And then Lily said something to Barney
that insulted every fiber of his being.
Nah.
Wait. No. It had to be more<br/>than just, "Nah."
Oh, I think she said...
You're a big... stupid octopus head!
No, that doesn't make sense.
Okay, hang on. What did she say?
She said, um, uh...
To be honest kids, I'm having a<br/>little trouble remembering
exactly what their fight was about.
Hey, it was 20 years ago!
I'll remember.
Anyway, the next night...
Well, Lily, you were right.
Something weird happened<br/>with Zoey last night.
Oh, that's the Captain.
Yes, I call my husband The Captain,
but that is the only concession<br/>I make to his seafaring ways.
Hang on.
Ahoy.
I'm just out with friends.
Friends. Plural.
Like-Like there was more than one of me.
Ew! Ew!
She lied to her husband? Uh-oh.
So, what did you do?
Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say<br/>you were out with friends?
Yeah. The Captain's on<br/>his way home from Milan.
He can get a little jealous sometimes,
so I didn't want to make him worry.
Is that okay?
It's totally okay.
It's not okay! I didn't<br/>really think it was okay!
Pur-leez! You lie to your<br/>husband all the time.
"Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""
"I love your mom""
"I never fantasize about<br/>Barney when we're doing it""
Sound familiar, Pinocchio?
What's wrong with this shirt?
Lily, ruling.
Do I have to stop
hanging out with Zoey?
No, you just need to spend time
with her and The Captain together.
If you're friends with the both of them,
then there's not a problem.
Actually, I do have a standing<br/>invitation from The Captain
to go for a ride with them on his boat.
Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy,
and problem solved.
The next night,
Marshall and Robin went to dinner,
just the two of them.
Now historically,
they had three solid conversation topics:
cold weather...
December chill-- so great.
Totally.
...sports...
Did you catch
the game last night?
Yeah. Nail-biter.
...and cold weather sports.
You know what's fun? Mm.
Is cold weather sports.
They are fun.
They blew through them all in<br/>the first 16 seconds.
Man, this is awkward.
She's giving me nothing!
He's just staring at me!
She's just staring at me!
It's making me nervous.
Great, now my left eye is twitching.
Marshall, it's cool.
She doesn't see it.
What the hell's going on with his eye?
Am I supposed to not talk about that?
Great, now my right eye is doing it.
Can I get you two some drinks?
Lots of drinks. Oh, so many drinks.
That same night, Barney and<br/>Lily were still fighting
about, um... something.
Or was it that other thing?
Barney. Save it, Lily.
I am still mad at you for...
something, and for that other thing.
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
But let's be honest.
You've been super sensitive lately.
No, I haven't!
God, how can you say that?!
Watch out!
Wait. They were on the street.
Watch out! Oh!
Wow. Thanks, Lily.
You saved me.
You saved us.
Look, I know you didn't mean
whatever it was you said<br/>that made me so mad.
I think I probably didn't.
And just like that, the fight was over.
You know, kids, friendship<br/>is funny sometimes.
Wait.
I still can't resist<br/>getting one last shot in.
Like I said, the fight was<br/>just getting started.
Hi, Captain.
The Captain.
Captain.
Ahoy, Ted!
Excellent to see you.
Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?
Well, I'm afraid
she's feeling a little under the weather.
Looks like it's just
you, me
and six hours in frigid<br/>international waters.
Or we could stay on dry land,<br/>hang out with some... witnesses.
You're a hoot.
I've been looking forward to this.
For a very long time.
Well, anchors aweigh!
Kids, here's one thing I do remember.
I was pretty sure I was going<br/>to die that night.
Mmm.
Mmm.
You know, I had this really<br/>boring poetry class in college.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You were just thinking that<br/>this dinner is really boring.
That's what made you think of<br/>your boring class in college.
What?! What? No! No! No, no, no.
Marshall, no. No. I...
I just saw that board of specials,<br/>and I thought,
you know what sucks?
Being bored.
Which I am not.
So that clears that... right up.
Robin, I'm an attorney.
Fine. This night's a little awkward.
I guess it's 'cause we never<br/>hang out alone together.
Why is that?
It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.
Two years ago, I had just hired<br/>a new assistant at GNB.
So, who's the eye broccoli?
Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant.
And yes, she's a little plain,
but I'm married, so that's good.
Mark my words, Marshall.
Someday you will find Iris<br/>so excruciatingly attractive,
you won't be able to look<br/>her directly in the boobs.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
Marshall, do you know how the<br/>myth of mermaids came to be?
I'm sorry. Myth?
It was 300 years ago.
Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate
for female companionship.
It got so bad that, eventually,
the manatees out in the water<br/>started to look like...
beautiful women.
Mermaids.
Let's go get some tail!
Oh.
You see, every woman,<br/>no matter how initially repugnant,
has a mermaid clock-- the time it takes
for you to realize you want to bone her.
Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee.
But she ain't gonna stay that way.
Marshall, your secretary's<br/>mermaid clock starts right now.
And it took one year, three months,<br/>and 16 days,
but eventually...
D'oh!
Told you.
The Mermaid Theory.
It's a thing.
You owe me 500 bucks.
Did we bet on this?
Let's say yes.
And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.
As Lily's best friend,<br/>you are the last person on the planet
o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.
Wait, does that mean
that I'm a manatee right now?
Big-time manatee.
What were those sailors thinking?
Huh. I don't know.
Being out at sea can do<br/>crazy things to a man.
Vast, the sea.
Deep.
Endless.
Going around for miles.
You could scream and scream,<br/>and not a soul would hear you.
Listen to this.
Help!
Somebody help me!
I'm trapped on a boat with a madman!
Help!
See? Nothing.
He's gonna kill me.
Okay, calm down, Teddy.
He's not jealous.
He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.
So, Ted,
I noticed you've been spending<br/>a lot of time with Zoey.
Okay, back to Barney and Lily
and whatever the hell they<br/>were fighting about.
Seriously? I step away for<br/>five seconds, and you eat
all my onion rings?
No surprise there.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you calling me fat?
If there is one thing you never do,
it is call a woman fat right to her face!
Wait. Barney's not a woman.
That's right-- Barney wasn't hurt by Lily,
Lily was hurt by Barney.
Want to hang?
Nah.
Watch out!
Wow... thanks, Barney.
You saved me.
You saved us.
If there's one thing you never do,
it's call a woman fat right to her face!
Okay, now I'm on track.
The rest of this story should<br/>make perfect sense.
Oh, Lily, I'm sorry.
Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
You're a jerk.
Okay, that makes no sense.
Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat.
I will never remember this story.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.
Just gonna make a quick call.
Hey, silly question.
What are our exact nautical coordinates?
How now?
Oh, bother.
Well...
she's a goner.
By now, the icy tide has already dropped
its core temperature to near freezing.
And down it goes.
Now it's at 50 meters.
Complete crushing blackness.
100 meters.
The pressure is so intense,
the keys are popping right out of its head.
Head? 200 meters.
No one will ever find its mangled remains,
save for the crustacea
that feed off its lifeless husk.
Can you hear me now?
No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.
Well, I got a big morning, so...
Dry cleaners, bank, you know,<br/>so... Ted, it's time.
I have something for you.
Wait here.
Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby.
Man versus sea.
You can do this.
You didn't get a "Good Effort" ribbon
from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp
because you don't have what it takes.
Found it.
Zoey told me
you're a scotch drinker.
I bought this special for tonight.
And just as I started to realize that maybe
I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.
Whoa!
Ted?
that if you spend
too much time alone with me,<br/>I'll turn into a mermaid?
Yes. I mean, sure, right now,<br/>you're bald and leathery
ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...
Am I blushing or...?
...but at some point, my stupid<br/>male brain will transform you
into a foxy fish-babe singin'
"Part of Your World" to my pants.
Okay, even if that happens,<br/>is there any way to un-mermaid me?
I asked Barney the same thing.
Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way
a woman can go back to<br/>being unattractive again,
but it's pretty gruesome.
Death?
Worse. Pregnancy.
If a baby's on board that train,
it is headed straight<br/>back to Manatee City...
where the grass ain't green<br/>and the girls ain't pretty.
Pregnancy?
Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant,
she becomes a manatee again.
Never thought I'd say that sentence.
Wait! That's it!
That's what Barney and<br/>Lily were fighting about!
The Mermaid Theory!
But their argument didn't<br/>happen at the same time
as all this other stuff.<br/>I'm literally in the wrong year!
It happened much,<br/>much later when Lily was...
pregnant.
Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me.
You wanna hang?
Nah.
Whenever we're alone, you spend
the whole time undressing me with your eyes.
You even take off my shoes.
High heels chafe my shoulders.
But you don't have to<br/>worry about that anymore.
Ever since you got pregnant,<br/>you're just a big fat manatee.
Well, you're a big...
stupid octopus face!
That was it! I remember now!
Wow. Thanks, Barney.
You saved me.
You saved us.
If there's one thing you never do,
it's call a woman "fat" right to her face!
I'm sorry, Lily.
Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
Oh...
You're a jerk.
Hey. Hey, wait.
Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait!
There's another addendum<br/>to The Mermaid Theory.
A pregnant woman who's<br/>become a manatee can become
a mermaid again through one simple act.
What's that?
Breast-feeding. Hot.
Really?
Really.
When those things swell up to<br/>three times their normal size...
so do I.
That's so sweet!
See kids? Told you I'd get it!
Okay, now we're even!
Yeah, that's the ending to<br/>a whole other story.
We'll get there.
So you really thought I was gonna kill you?
Well... ish.
Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.
If I wanted to kill you,<br/>I'd invite you to my hunting lodge.
It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have
to worry about you turning up<br/>in some nosy fisherman's net.
See? It's stuff like that.
Why-why do you talk that way?
Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.
See, sometimes I don't bond as well
with Zoey's younger friends.
But I know she really likes you.
I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.
We can.
We can be buddies.
Just not on a boat.
Fair enough.
The hunting lodge it is.
Ho-ho-ho!
You know, once we stopped<br/>trying to have a conversation
and just focused on the drinking...
I had fun.
Yeah, me, too.
And then a terrible thing happened.
Marshall's beer goggles kicked in
and his very drunk mind started to see...
No... No, no!
No! No,
don't turn!
Uh-oh.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry!
Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.
I really do.
And from that moment on
Marshall never worried
about Robin becoming a mermaid again,
and the two of them were closer than ever.
There you go.
Hey, Ted.
Hey. You feeling better?
I have a confession to make.
I wasn't really sick.
You weren't?
I'm sorry.
I was just feeling guilty
that I lied to The Captain and...
I don't know, I just<br/>thought it would be good
if you two spent some time together.
I get it.
And you were right.
He's a nice guy.
I mean, he can be a little scary.
Yeah, he gets a little<br/>murder-y when he's nervous.
Yeah, he's a creepy dude.
But I like him.
And I just want to make sure
you and I hanging out
doesn't, you know, cross any lines.
Me, too.
I mean, if either one of us<br/>had even the slightest hint
of feelings for the other,<br/>we shouldn't hang out.
You don't, do you?
No. Do you?
No.
Still no sign of land.
It's been 243 days since we've seen
another living soul.
What are you looking at?
Dude, we need to find land.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In December of 2010...
my friends and I decided to go see<br/>It's a Wonderful Life on the big screen.
It seemed like something<br/>we all needed.
After all, it had been<br/>a crazy couple days.
It all started with a pregnancy test.
This is taking forever.<br/>Are you sure you did it right?
Is there a wrong way<br/>to pee on a stick?
Can I ask you a question that's<br/>plagued me for years? Can girls aim?
Um, can boys aim?
'Cause it seems to me like I'm takin' a mop<br/>to that bathroom floor every two days.
Okay, you're the one who put<br/>the Far Side calendar up over the toilet.
You know I laugh<br/>with my whole body.
It's been two minutes.
One, two, three.
It's positive.
It's positive?<br/>It's positive?
- It's positive.<br/>- It's positive? It's positive!
It's positive!
- I'm pregnant.<br/>- What?
I've never seen<br/>that woman before in my life.
Sorry. Force of habit.<br/>Congratulations!
To Lily and Marshall.
- To Lily and Marshall.<br/>- Well, thank you.
- We've never been happier.<br/>- Mmm.
Can't imagine anything<br/>bringing me down right now.
You're not pregnant.
Well, that did it.
Kids, this is the story...
of the 36 hours we all thought<br/>Lily was pregnant...
and how it caused each of us<br/>to reexamine our own lives.
Because while this was happening...
Are you sure you did it right?
I was on the phone with Punchy,<br/>my best friend from high school...
who had recently asked me<br/>to be his best man.
Yeah, Punchy, I've given this<br/>some serious thought.
I think I know how we can crush<br/>these floral arrangements.
Here it comes.<br/>Hit me up, Schmos.
Peonies, lavender blossoms<br/>with a halo of baby's breath...
for an ambience<br/>of springtime rejuvenation.
Crushed it!
That's exactly the accent of whimsy<br/>this celebration of love needs!
It's gonna be a magical day.
I know what you're thinkin'.<br/>"I wish I was a dude."
I do wish you were a dude.
Because if I was a dude, I could<br/>have Ted Mosby as my best man.
No. And here's why.
Ted, the best man's job...
is not to crush<br/>the floral arrangements.
It's to get the groom<br/>down the aisle.
Because no matter who he is,<br/>he will freak out.
I just don't think you have what<br/>it takes to get that soldier...
to pick up his rifle<br/>and charge up the hill.
Uh, are you forgetting? I've done this before.<br/>I was Marshall's best man.
And how did that go again?
No!
0 for 1.
Oh, come on.<br/>That wasn't my fault.
And need I remind you,<br/>I gave a beautiful toast.
Ted.
O, do you take One to be<br/>your lawfully wedded wife?
Oh, God, I'm freakin' out.
Why did I choose Ted<br/>to be my best man?
Uh, yeah, it's hard to<br/>take criticism from someone...
who just recorded seven episodes<br/>of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.
Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails<br/>was an extremely popular show...
with an extremely simple premise.
All right, your practice flip<br/>came up tails...
but our Vegas oddsmaker<br/>tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50.
And so, Jordan,<br/>for one million dollars...
heads or tails?
Tails! Heads! Tails!
What was the year<br/>of the coin again?
Why the sudden obsession<br/>with Heads or Tails?
Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails<br/>has a job opening.
- Heads! Tails!<br/>- Ta... Heads.
Marni, flip that coin.
So now because of that incident,<br/>Heads or Tails is looking for a new...
"currency rotation specialist."
- You mean "coin flip bimbo"?<br/>- They're not bimbos.
You auditioned, didn't you?
- And you're Canadian?<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Robin, aside from that coin, this is<br/>the other thing that's flipping right now.
What is my lid for you?
You're the new coin flip bimbo?
Currency rotation specialist.
Robin, you better check yourself...
before you Trebek yourself.
- You're a journalist.<br/>What is the matter with you?<br/>- It's a national audience.
I get to wear shiny dresses.
Robin, have you forgotten about<br/>your New Year's resolution?
I'm never drinking again.
No, before that.
I am gonna finish<br/>this whole bottle tonight.
Before that too.
I moved here...
to work for a big-time cable news channel<br/>like World Wide News.
Well, by this time next year...
I will be wearing a World Wide News<br/>I.D. badge around my neck.
And to show you that I'm serious...
this is my first<br/>and only drink of the night.
- Okay.<br/>- Okay?
Oh, damn, that's smooth.
I thought you finally got that interview<br/>at World Wide News.
Well, I did.
But they only offered me a boring,<br/>low-paid, off-camera research job.
Which could be a stepping stone<br/>to bigger things in your career.
So could Heads or Tails.
The first currency rotation specialist...
went on to be a semifinalist<br/>on The Bachelor.
And then she lost, like, a hundred pounds<br/>on The Biggest Loser.
And now she's totally winning<br/>Celebrity Rehab.
It seemed like<br/>there was no changing Robin's mind.
But what we didn't realize<br/>was that in a few minutes...
our whole world was<br/>going to be turned upside-down.
- I'm pregnant.<br/>- What?
Now, kids, when your friends have<br/>great news, you're happy for them...
for, like, a millisecond.
And then you start<br/>thinking about yourself.
Oh, my God.<br/>They're really having a baby.
What am I doing with my life?
Starting Monday,<br/>I'm a currency rotation sp...
Oh, who am I kidding?<br/>I'm a coin flip bimbo.
And I'm still single.
Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky.<br/>That's a whole other thing.
I gotta take<br/>that World Wide News job.
And so the next night,<br/>we had two things to celebrate.
Well, you are looking at the new associate<br/>researcher at World Wide News.
Oh, my gosh! That's amazing news.
- What changed your mind?<br/>- Marshall and Lily.
I just realized that I am about to have<br/>a little niece who looks up to me...
and I don't wanna be sad Aunt Robin...
the aging coin flip bimbo<br/>who gives her the creeps.
I wanna be cool Aunt Robin...
the respected journalist<br/>who gives her beer.
- What?<br/>- What? Oh...
I have never seen you guys<br/>looking so at peace.
To Lily and Marshall.
- To Lily and Marshall.<br/>- Well, thank you.
I mean, we've never been happier.
The next day, Robin called<br/>Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.
Hi. Mr. Trebek, um,<br/>this is Robin Scherbatsky.
- But at that moment...<br/>- You're not pregnant.
As honored as I am by the offer, um...
Oh, my God.<br/>They're not having a baby.
What am I getting<br/>all up in my head about?
That research job sounds hard.
And I'm pretty.<br/>I'm really, really pretty.
You are looking<br/>at the new coin flip bimbo.
Whoosh!
- You took the Heads or Tails job?<br/>- Yeah.
What about World Wide News?<br/>Your I.D. badge?
You made a New Year's resolution.
Okay, I also said I would never<br/>make out with a garbageman.
Life is what happens when<br/>you're busy making other plans.
What's with the gingerbread house?
We're seeing a Christmas movie.
- It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.<br/>- Mmm.
Let's hope Santa brings you<br/>a girlfriend this year, Teddy.
Where the hell is Barney?
Where was Barney?<br/>Let's back up again.
You see, while this was going on...
- It's positive.<br/>- It's positive?
this was happening.
And now she's totally winning<br/>Celebrity Rehab.
Hey, guys.
A yuletide riddle.
What is my second-favorite word<br/>that begins with B-O-N?
Bon Jovi?
What is my third-favorite word<br/>that begins with B-O-N?
"Bonus."
As in my end-of-the-year<br/>bonus check.
My God!
Barney, I work for GNB too.
All I got was a $15 gift card<br/>to Costa Coffee.
And you earned it, buddy.
Check out<br/>what I'm gonna buy for myself.
The Dibiase.
See those pinstripes... diamonds.
It is the uppest<br/>a person could ever suit.
Uh, has it ever occurred to you<br/>to give some of this to charity?
Charity?
You're seriously talking to me<br/>about charity, dude? I am Mr. Charity.
I frequently sleep with sixes...
chubsters, over-30s.
I am the Bill and Melinda Gates<br/>of the sympathy bang.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey.
- Big announcement.<br/>- Let me guess. You got<br/>a huge bonus check too.
No, just a $30 gift card<br/>to Costa Coffee.
- Thirty?<br/>- I'm pregnant.
What?
I've never seen<br/>that woman before in my life.
Sorry. Force of habit.<br/>Congratulations!
Huh.
Marshall and Lily<br/>are doing something meaningful...
and it's making me less<br/>happy about this bonus.
And I'm still single.<br/>At least I got that goin'for me.
So why do I still feel<br/>outside of awesome looking in?
What am I doing with my life?
- We've never been happier.<br/>- Mmm.
Can't imagine anything<br/>bringing me down right now.
Oh, Marshall, you only<br/>think you're happy. Just wait.
Because tonight...
is Barney's favorite things!
That was the reaction Barney expected.
...things!<br/>- This is the one he got.
- Huh?<br/>- I don't know what that is.
Barney's favorite things.
I'm gonna give y'all<br/>a bunch of free stuff.
- Like Oprah.<br/>- Oh.
Just get excited, okay?
Sure.<br/>The next hour got pretty weird.
Velour tracksuits!
- Velour is so comfortable.<br/>- These are so soft!
Remote control helicopters!
Condoms!
And last but not least...
there is a fleet of limos outside...
waiting to take us to...
a strip club!
You get a lap dance!
You get a lap dance!
You are gonna give me<br/>a lap dance!
Everybody gets a lap dance!
Amazing! It was like<br/>a diamond suit for my soul.
I gotta keep going.<br/>I gotta do more.
No. No. I cannot go<br/>back to that strip club.
I've seen some things.
I'm not going back either.
I'm takin' the rest of my bonus<br/>to God's strip club.
The next day, he paid<br/>a visit to the most charitable man he knew...
his half-brother's father... Sam Gibbs,<br/>a minister at a church out on Long Island.
Sam... Uh, Father.
l-I don't mean<br/>Father Father.
- Unless...<br/>- What's up, Barney?
I'm thinking about giving<br/>some money to charity.
Is that the name of the stripper<br/>you been e-mailing me about?
You gotta take me<br/>off that list, Barney.
No, I don't mean that Charity.
That Charity is doin' Peachy.
You'll see pics of the two of 'em<br/>in next week's e-mail. What up!
Barney, I'm a minister.
Unsubscribe.
l... I recently started giving...
and it felt surprisingly good.
- I wanna do more.<br/>- Well, now you're talking.
We have this program that helps<br/>those in need get back on their feet.
We give them food, a place to live,<br/>clothes for job interviews.
Well, I would love to help<br/>by writing a check...
for one-zero-zero-zero...
You're not pregnant.
zero...
Whoops.<br/>Hold on a second.
Waitl
They're not doing something<br/>meaningful with their lives.
Well, this changes everything.
Oh, no. I've already<br/>written four zeros.
Thank you, decimal point.
$100.00.
That's great.
Thank you, Barney.
Diamond suited up.
Hey, Ted, can you spot me<br/>for the movie?
I don't like to carry<br/>a lot of cash on me.
What happened<br/>to giving the money away?
That was back when Lily was pregnant.<br/>Now she's not.
Ergo, a suit is born.
Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house?<br/>You look ridiculous.
It's a Christmas-themed<br/>movie snack.
Oh, I know that move.
You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches<br/>into the living room, finds the tree.
# O holy night #
Nice.
Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?
Let's back up one last time.
- I'm pregnant.<br/>- What?
I've never seen<br/>that woman before in my life.
Sorry. Force of habit.<br/>Congratulations!
This is great. I'm happy.
I'm so happy<br/>my heart's pounding.
And I'm sweating.<br/>And I can't breathe.
This is what happiness<br/>feels like, right?
Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby,<br/>and I'm having a panic attack.
I hope she can't tell<br/>what I'm thinking right now.<br/>- I can.
And I'm freaking out tool
There's an alien growing in my stomach<br/>that's gonna explode out of my vaginal
- Do you think the others<br/>can tell we're freakin'out?<br/>- What am I doing with my life?
What am I doing with my life?
I should get a Christmas-themed<br/>movie snack for tomorrow night.
They're totally on to us.<br/>What do we do?
Just keep smiling.<br/>Maybe wave.
No, don't wavel<br/>That makes no sensel
I'm committed.<br/>I'm riding this wave straight to hell.
Let's leave.<br/>Then the waving will make sense.
See you guys tomorrow.<br/>So Lily and Marshall headed home.
Lily, we have to relax.<br/>There's no need to panic.
Lily, we have to relax.<br/>There's no need to panic.
True, there's a lot to do,<br/>but we've got nine months to prepare.
So I say we make a list of everything that<br/>needs to get done before the baby arrives...
and do everything on that list tonight!
Let's do it!
Uh-huh. Got it.
Okay. That seems easy.
Nursery's painted.
- Blue? What if it's a girl?<br/>- Damn it!
# It's the time and the place #
# Why all these lights<br/>popping off in my face? #
# Or am I freakin'out?<br/>Freakin'out? #
# Freakin'out? Freakin'out?<br/>Freakin'out? ##
Oh, God, it's 8:00. We're supposed to<br/>meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.
Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them,<br/>we have to keep it together.
- Can you keep it together?<br/>- No, I can't keep it together!
I have never seen you guys<br/>looking so at peace.
To Lily and Marshall.
- To Lily and Marshall.<br/>- Well, thank you.
I mean, we've never been happier.
This is a nightmare!<br/>We've done everything wrong!
The iPod was on shuffle!
The Jerky Boys.
Our baby heard The Jerky Boys!
- The Jerky Boys are funny.<br/>- The Jerky Boys aren't funny! They are awful!
Fine. If you don't think<br/>The Jerky Boys are funny...
then I'm not sure that I can<br/>raise a child with you, liver lips!
- Marshall, I don't like this.<br/>- I know.
Okay?<br/>I don't like it either.
It's like I have a hot,<br/>burning ball of stress in my chest...
and nothing will make it go away!
- You're not pregnant.<br/>- Well, that did it.
I know this probably comes<br/>as quite a disappointment.
Yeah.
Huge bummer.
So disappointing.
- # Snow on the ground, snow in the... #<br/>- Hey. You guys okay?
Yeah.<br/>Why wouldn't we be?
Oh, the baby thing.
Oh, yeah.<br/>Whatever.
Oh, Christmas-themed<br/>movie snack. Nice.
Don't reach into the living room.
Wow. I thought you guys<br/>would be devastated.
Oh. You know,<br/>we're actually kind of relieved.
We were freakin' out<br/>for about a day and a half there.
Yeah. This whole thing<br/>got us thinking...
maybe we're not ready<br/>for kids yet after all.
- We were thinking maybe we'd just get a dog.<br/>- Get a puppy!
Can you imagine?<br/>You could put it in little human shirts...
Whoa!
- Our movie snack.<br/>- Are you kidding me?
All you ever talk about is having kids!
And now you have one little freak-out<br/>and you wanna get a dog instead?
No. Unacceptable.
You're gonna turn around,<br/>you're gonna go home, get naked...
lie together as man and wife<br/>until Lily is great with child.
Right now!
I'm serious!<br/>Go! Go! Go!
Marshall and Lily got in trouble.
- And you!<br/>- Ooh.
Barney, you look real stupid in that suit.
You're gonna go get your money back<br/>and give it to charity.
And I don't mean that stripper<br/>you keep e-mailing us about...
even though we beg you<br/>to take us off that list.
I can't give this suit back.
Ted, I glow in the dark.<br/>I finally glow in the dark.
Criminals of New York, attention!
This man is wearing<br/>a diamond-covered suit!
You can retire on the pants alone!
Merry Christmas!
So, if I get a large popcorn,<br/>you wanna go splitskies, or...
And you.
You did not move to<br/>the greatest city on earth...
to become a coin-flipping bimbo.
So here's how it's gonna work.
Heads, you take the job<br/>at World Wide News.
Tails, you take the job<br/>at World Wide News.
Ow!
Hey, looks like somebody<br/>got a new gig!
Fine.<br/>I'll call 'em tomorrow.
I'll call 'em right now!
God.
Hello.
- Ted, I can't get married!<br/>- Yes, you can! You love her!
You're right. I do.<br/>Thanks, Ted!
One for<br/>It's a Wonderful Life, please.
# Christmastime is here again #
Thank you.
# All this joy for girls and boys #
- We're idiots.<br/>- This kid doesn't stand a chance.
- We're ready for this.<br/>- We're ready for this.
Wow!
That's a lot of zeros.
- You're sure you're not<br/>missing a decimal point?<br/>- Nope.
And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon.<br/>You'll meet everyone there.
But first you need<br/>to head down to Security.
You need to get your picture<br/>taken for your I.D. badge.
# Merry Christmas #
You sure?
Positive.
There's more.<br/>Do you still do that thing...
where you give people in need<br/>clothes for job interviews?
- Yeah. Why?<br/>- Bring 'em in, boys.
# Bring out the joy #
# Light up the tree #
Merry Christmas.
Thank you, son.
- Son?<br/>- It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad.
# Merry #
# Christmas ##
Congratulations.
You know, that was really cool<br/>what you did.
When we all needed it,<br/>you got us back on the right path.
It's what I do.
Ted, if I, um... if I ever get married...<br/>and you're not the guy I'm marrying...
Big mistake.<br/>But go on.
I could really<br/>use someone like you.
You know, in case I freak out...<br/>when I freak out.
You interested?
Are you asking<br/>what I think you're asking?
Ted, will you be my best man?
Scherbatsky, I'm gonna crush it.
- Let me look at this.<br/>- Can we not?
How do you even make...<br/>I've never seen you make that face.
Hi there.<br/>We've had a lot of fun tonight.
But on a more serious note...
this is the time of year when we remember<br/>the importance of giving.
And there's no greater gift<br/>than the gift of booty.
So this holiday season...
why not bang someone in need?
I'm Barney Stinson, and that's...<br/>one to grow on.
Um, no.
Hi there. You know,<br/>we've had a lot of fun tonight.
English - US - SDH<br/></div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the winter of 2010,
we had a new addition to our<br/>little group-- Zoey.
Zoey was married to... The Captain.
Boys! Great to see you!
Looking smart.
Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?
Okay.
That man is terrifying.
Everything he said was nice,<br/>but I am profoundly scared.
Keep smiling. He can still see us.
There was just something about him.
We couldn't put our finger on it until...
I figured it out!
I know what's so creepy about The Captain.
Okay.
Yeah.
I snapped this photo of him
last time he dropped off Zoey.
Observe.
The bottom half of his face... is smiling.
Oh. Look, he seems happy.
Seems like a nice guy.
But the top half of his face...
...wants to murder you!
Cheerful.
Wants to murder you.
No. Cheerful.
Wants to murder you.
Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question.
Captain, what do you think of ice cream?
Oh, he loves it!
Captain, what do you think of rainy days?
Whoa, he hates them.
Captain, quick question:
How do you feel about<br/>the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh.
What-What is that?
I don't get it. I don't get it.
He hates that he loves them.
Ah!
Captioning sponsored by<br/>20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION,
CBS
and TOYOTA.
Great. Okay.
Hey, guys, Zoey just told me
about this great Frank Lloyd<br/>Wright retrospective tonight.
Who's in?
Sorry, I'm, uh, I...
I- I don't know, washing my hair.
Running the water.
Holding the towel.
And I'll be home
trying to get over the fact
that no one invited me to<br/>the big hair washing party.
All right, fine.<br/>Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.
Oh, wait. Just the two of you?
Tread lightly, Mosby.
Any time
a single guy hangs out
with a married woman,
there are rules that must be followed.
Rule number one...
Don't use the husband's condoms.
That's just rude.
Rule number one:
don't go anywhere that has candles.
Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel
about Ted and Zoey having an<br/>intimate chat by candlelight?
Mm-hmm...
It'll be the last dinner they ever have.
Rule number two:
No sharing food. Hmm.
In fact, anything involving<br/>saliva is off-limits.
Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.
Well, if I can't share her lipstick,
there's really no point in even going.
And the most important rule of all...
Lubricant is public property.
Please.
No lying to the spouse
about anything you do.
Why would anyone lie?
Look, Zoey and I are just friends.
If there was anything more than that,
I wouldn't hang out with her.
Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married,
it's very hard to be friends
with a single person of the<br/>opposite sex. ROBIN: Yeah.
Unless you're old friends, which is why
I can hang out with<br/>Marshall whenever I want.
Right, Marsh Madness?
No doubt, Robo Cop.
You two never hang out alone.
You just made up those nicknames right now.
I guess it's true.
You and I never really hang out alone.
Well, let's. Let's have dinner together,<br/>just the two of us.
Oh! Sweet.
No candles.
No candles.
Lily, I guess that leaves<br/>just you and me. Want to hang?
And then Lily said something to Barney
that insulted every fiber of his being.
Nah.
Wait. No. It had to be more<br/>than just, "Nah."
Oh, I think she said...
You're a big... stupid octopus head!
No, that doesn't make sense.
Okay, hang on. What did she say?
She said, um, uh...
To be honest kids, I'm having a<br/>little trouble remembering
exactly what their fight was about.
Hey, it was 20 years ago!
I'll remember.
Anyway, the next night...
Well, Lily, you were right.
Something weird happened<br/>with Zoey last night.
Oh, that's the Captain.
Yes, I call my husband The Captain,
but that is the only concession<br/>I make to his seafaring ways.
Hang on.
Ahoy.
I'm just out with friends.
Friends. Plural.
Like-Like there was more than one of me.
Ew! Ew!
She lied to her husband? Uh-oh.
So, what did you do?
Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say<br/>you were out with friends?
Yeah. The Captain's on<br/>his way home from Milan.
He can get a little jealous sometimes,
so I didn't want to make him worry.
Is that okay?
It's totally okay.
It's not okay! I didn't<br/>really think it was okay!
Pur-leez! You lie to your<br/>husband all the time.
"Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""
"I love your mom""
"I never fantasize about<br/>Barney when we're doing it""
Sound familiar, Pinocchio?
What's wrong with this shirt?
Lily, ruling.
Do I have to stop
hanging out with Zoey?
No, you just need to spend time
with her and The Captain together.
If you're friends with the both of them,
then there's not a problem.
Actually, I do have a standing<br/>invitation from The Captain
to go for a ride with them on his boat.
Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy,
and problem solved.
The next night,
Marshall and Robin went to dinner,
just the two of them.
Now historically,
they had three solid conversation topics:
cold weather...
December chill-- so great.
Totally.
...sports...
Did you catch
the game last night?
Yeah. Nail-biter.
...and cold weather sports.
You know what's fun? Mm.
Is cold weather sports.
They are fun.
They blew through them all in<br/>the first 16 seconds.
Man, this is awkward.
She's giving me nothing!
He's just staring at me!
She's just staring at me!
It's making me nervous.
Great, now my left eye is twitching.
Marshall, it's cool.
She doesn't see it.
What the hell's going on with his eye?
Am I supposed to not talk about that?
Great, now my right eye is doing it.
Can I get you two some drinks?
Lots of drinks. Oh, so many drinks.
That same night, Barney and<br/>Lily were still fighting
about, um... something.
Or was it that other thing?
Barney. Save it, Lily.
I am still mad at you for...
something, and for that other thing.
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
But let's be honest.
You've been super sensitive lately.
No, I haven't!
God, how can you say that?!
Watch out!
Wait. They were on the street.
Watch out! Oh!
Wow. Thanks, Lily.
You saved me.
You saved us.
Look, I know you didn't mean
whatever it was you said<br/>that made me so mad.
I think I probably didn't.
And just like that, the fight was over.
You know, kids, friendship<br/>is funny sometimes.
Wait.
I still can't resist<br/>getting one last shot in.
Like I said, the fight was<br/>just getting started.
Hi, Captain.
The Captain.
Captain.
Ahoy, Ted!
Excellent to see you.
Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?
Well, I'm afraid
she's feeling a little under the weather.
Looks like it's just
you, me
and six hours in frigid<br/>international waters.
Or we could stay on dry land,<br/>hang out with some... witnesses.
You're a hoot.
I've been looking forward to this.
For a very long time.
Well, anchors aweigh!
Kids, here's one thing I do remember.
I was pretty sure I was going<br/>to die that night.
Mmm.
Mmm.
You know, I had this really<br/>boring poetry class in college.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You were just thinking that<br/>this dinner is really boring.
That's what made you think of<br/>your boring class in college.
What?! What? No! No! No, no, no.
Marshall, no. No. I...
I just saw that board of specials,<br/>and I thought,
you know what sucks?
Being bored.
Which I am not.
So that clears that... right up.
Robin, I'm an attorney.
Fine. This night's a little awkward.
I guess it's 'cause we never<br/>hang out alone together.
Why is that?
It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.
Two years ago, I had just hired<br/>a new assistant at GNB.
So, who's the eye broccoli?
Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant.
And yes, she's a little plain,
but I'm married, so that's good.
Mark my words, Marshall.
Someday you will find Iris<br/>so excruciatingly attractive,
you won't be able to look<br/>her directly in the boobs.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
Marshall, do you know how the<br/>myth of mermaids came to be?
I'm sorry. Myth?
It was 300 years ago.
Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate
for female companionship.
It got so bad that, eventually,
the manatees out in the water<br/>started to look like...
beautiful women.
Mermaids.
Let's go get some tail!
Oh.
You see, every woman,<br/>no matter how initially repugnant,
has a mermaid clock-- the time it takes
for you to realize you want to bone her.
Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee.
But she ain't gonna stay that way.
Marshall, your secretary's<br/>mermaid clock starts right now.
And it took one year, three months,<br/>and 16 days,
but eventually...
D'oh!
Told you.
The Mermaid Theory.
It's a thing.
You owe me 500 bucks.
Did we bet on this?
Let's say yes.
And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.
As Lily's best friend,<br/>you are the last person on the planet
o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.
Wait, does that mean
that I'm a manatee right now?
Big-time manatee.
What were those sailors thinking?
Huh. I don't know.
Being out at sea can do<br/>crazy things to a man.
Vast, the sea.
Deep.
Endless.
Going around for miles.
You could scream and scream,<br/>and not a soul would hear you.
Listen to this.
Help!
Somebody help me!
I'm trapped on a boat with a madman!
Help!
See? Nothing.
He's gonna kill me.
Okay, calm down, Teddy.
He's not jealous.
He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.
So, Ted,
I noticed you've been spending<br/>a lot of time with Zoey.
Okay, back to Barney and Lily
and whatever the hell they<br/>were fighting about.
Seriously? I step away for<br/>five seconds, and you eat
all my onion rings?
No surprise there.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you calling me fat?
If there is one thing you never do,
it is call a woman fat right to her face!
Wait. Barney's not a woman.
That's right-- Barney wasn't hurt by Lily,
Lily was hurt by Barney.
Want to hang?
Nah.
Watch out!
Wow... thanks, Barney.
You saved me.
You saved us.
If there's one thing you never do,
it's call a woman fat right to her face!
Okay, now I'm on track.
The rest of this story should<br/>make perfect sense.
Oh, Lily, I'm sorry.
Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
You're a jerk.
Okay, that makes no sense.
Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat.
I will never remember this story.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.
Just gonna make a quick call.
Hey, silly question.
What are our exact nautical coordinates?
How now?
Oh, bother.
Well...
she's a goner.
By now, the icy tide has already dropped
its core temperature to near freezing.
And down it goes.
Now it's at 50 meters.
Complete crushing blackness.
100 meters.
The pressure is so intense,
the keys are popping right out of its head.
Head? 200 meters.
No one will ever find its mangled remains,
save for the crustacea
that feed off its lifeless husk.
Can you hear me now?
No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.
Well, I got a big morning, so...
Dry cleaners, bank, you know,<br/>so... Ted, it's time.
I have something for you.
Wait here.
Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby.
Man versus sea.
You can do this.
You didn't get a "Good Effort" ribbon
from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp
because you don't have what it takes.
Found it.
Zoey told me
you're a scotch drinker.
I bought this special for tonight.
And just as I started to realize that maybe
I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.
Whoa!
Ted?
that if you spend
too much time alone with me,<br/>I'll turn into a mermaid?
Yes. I mean, sure, right now,<br/>you're bald and leathery
ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...
Am I blushing or...?
...but at some point, my stupid<br/>male brain will transform you
into a foxy fish-babe singin'
"Part of Your World" to my pants.
Okay, even if that happens,<br/>is there any way to un-mermaid me?
I asked Barney the same thing.
Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way
a woman can go back to<br/>being unattractive again,
but it's pretty gruesome.
Death?
Worse. Pregnancy.
If a baby's on board that train,
it is headed straight<br/>back to Manatee City...
where the grass ain't green<br/>and the girls ain't pretty.
Pregnancy?
Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant,
she becomes a manatee again.
Never thought I'd say that sentence.
Wait! That's it!
That's what Barney and<br/>Lily were fighting about!
The Mermaid Theory!
But their argument didn't<br/>happen at the same time
as all this other stuff.<br/>I'm literally in the wrong year!
It happened much,<br/>much later when Lily was...
pregnant.
Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me.
You wanna hang?
Nah.
Whenever we're alone, you spend
the whole time undressing me with your eyes.
You even take off my shoes.
High heels chafe my shoulders.
But you don't have to<br/>worry about that anymore.
Ever since you got pregnant,<br/>you're just a big fat manatee.
Well, you're a big...
stupid octopus face!
That was it! I remember now!
Wow. Thanks, Barney.
You saved me.
You saved us.
If there's one thing you never do,
it's call a woman "fat" right to her face!
I'm sorry, Lily.
Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
Oh...
You're a jerk.
Hey. Hey, wait.
Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait!
There's another addendum<br/>to The Mermaid Theory.
A pregnant woman who's<br/>become a manatee can become
a mermaid again through one simple act.
What's that?
Breast-feeding. Hot.
Really?
Really.
When those things swell up to<br/>three times their normal size...
so do I.
That's so sweet!
See kids? Told you I'd get it!
Okay, now we're even!
Yeah, that's the ending to<br/>a whole other story.
We'll get there.
So you really thought I was gonna kill you?
Well... ish.
Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.
If I wanted to kill you,<br/>I'd invite you to my hunting lodge.
It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have
to worry about you turning up<br/>in some nosy fisherman's net.
See? It's stuff like that.
Why-why do you talk that way?
Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.
See, sometimes I don't bond as well
with Zoey's younger friends.
But I know she really likes you.
I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.
We can.
We can be buddies.
Just not on a boat.
Fair enough.
The hunting lodge it is.
Ho-ho-ho!
You know, once we stopped<br/>trying to have a conversation
and just focused on the drinking...
I had fun.
Yeah, me, too.
And then a terrible thing happened.
Marshall's beer goggles kicked in
and his very drunk mind started to see...
No... No, no!
No! No,
don't turn!
Uh-oh.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry!
Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.
I really do.
And from that moment on
Marshall never worried
about Robin becoming a mermaid again,
and the two of them were closer than ever.
There you go.
Hey, Ted.
Hey. You feeling better?
I have a confession to make.
I wasn't really sick.
You weren't?
I'm sorry.
I was just feeling guilty
that I lied to The Captain and...
I don't know, I just<br/>thought it would be good
if you two spent some time together.
I get it.
And you were right.
He's a nice guy.
I mean, he can be a little scary.
Yeah, he gets a little<br/>murder-y when he's nervous.
Yeah, he's a creepy dude.
But I like him.
And I just want to make sure
you and I hanging out
doesn't, you know, cross any lines.
Me, too.
I mean, if either one of us<br/>had even the slightest hint
of feelings for the other,<br/>we shouldn't hang out.
You don't, do you?
No. Do you?
No.
Still no sign of land.
It's been 243 days since we've seen
another living soul.
What are you looking at?
Dude, we need to find land.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, when your best friend<br/>loses someone...
My dad's dead?
...you drop everything<br/>and rush to his side.
Only to find yourself<br/>standing there
with no idea what to do or say.
This is the toughest time<br/>in Marshall's life
and I feel absolutely useless.
What can we do to help?
Don't look at me.
This morning Marshall said,<br/>"I have to pee".
And I, "Don't worry, baby,<br/>I'll do it for you".
Halfway through the pee,
I'm, like, "This doesn't<br/>even make sense!"
Well, uh, I've been<br/>to a couple funerals,
so I know my role:<br/>I'm Vice Girl.
Whatever Marshall needs<br/>to get through this day,
I got it right here.
Whoa!
Cigarettes, alcohol...
are these firecrackers?
My God, Robin,<br/>you somehow crammed
Tijuana into a purse.
Be cool, nerds!
Marshall's mom hasn't eaten,<br/>slept or sat down
since we got here.
Wait! That can be my role!
I'll take care of Judy!
Yeah, but doesn't<br/>Marshall's mom hate you...
the fact that you two<br/>aren't very close?
Sweet save.
Okay, yes,<br/>Judy and I aren't besties,
but today, whatever she needs,<br/>I'm there.
I'm on Judy duty.
"Judy duty".
She said "doody".
Really, guys? At a funeral?
Uh, okay, while not all<br/>of us possess
your lofty sense of decorum,
Drug-Dealer-From-An-'80s-<br/>After-School-Special,
we have to laugh today.
- It's healthy.<br/>- Wait a minute!
Today, we are gonna make<br/>Marshall laugh.
How?
Ted, what's the one thing that
always cracks him up?
Internet footage of a guy<br/>getting hit in the nuts.
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts, exactly!
So we are gonna get our bro<br/>a four-star nad rattler.
You search knees, feet, banisters,
fire hydrants and diving boards,
and I'll cover bats, rackets,<br/>hockey sticks,
golf clubs and riding crops.
What about animals?
Uh... claws, paws, talons,
hooves, beaks and<br/>clenched monkey fists.
We can do this!
Hey, guys, sorry, uh...<br/>I left my charger back
in New York, so my phone's<br/>out of juice.
Does anyone have...?
Outlet or USB?
Uh, outlet.
Thank you.
Oh...
Wow, you really do have<br/>everything in there, don't you?
You're like Mary Poppins,<br/>if her magic purse was
also filled with drugs.
"If"? Ted, the kids<br/>in that movie jumped
into a painting and spent 15<br/>minutes chasing a cartoon fox.
"Spoonful of sugar..."?
Grow up.
I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.
Thank you, Reverend.
We're so happy that you're<br/>going to lead the services today.
Unfortunately, I can't.
My daughter in Chicago<br/>just went into labor.
But I'm leaving you in<br/>the capable hands
of my second-in-command: my son.
Your son?
Oh, you remember Trey.
I'll go grab him.
Guys...
Trey Platt terrorized me<br/>growing up.
He was, he was the toughest<br/>bully in school.
'Sup Marshall.
Hello, Trey.
- Long time.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
I was not aware
that you had become a reverend.
Yeah, well, your lunch money<br/>finally ran out.
Kidding!
Marshall Eriksen,<br/>you could use a laugh.
Yeah!
This video is entitled,<br/>"Little League Coach Gets Hit in
the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then<br/>Vomits in a Garbage Can".
I don't wanna give anything away.<br/>Let's just watch.
Oh!
See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...
right in the nuts,
The fat kid just runs away.
Trey Platt.
I can't believe
my father's funeral<br/>service is being led
by Trey "The Noogie Machine" Platt.
That guy gave you noogies?
What, did he carry a stepladder?
He made me carry it.
So, my dad has these questions<br/>he asks to help create
a theme for the service,<br/>or whatever.
Question one:
"What were your last words<br/>with the deceased?"
Lame.
Question two:
Wait...
My last words with<br/>Marvin were lovely.
I've been thinking<br/>about them a lot.
Me, too.
We went for a hike in the snow
and had this amazing talk.
My last day with Pop,
he taught my son how to skate.
Well, this is<br/>clearly yielding nothing.
Thanks, Dad.
Guess I'll have to fill the time
with some jokes... again.
"Last words" seems<br/>like a good theme.
Marshall, do you<br/>remember the last thing
your father said to you?
- Bye, sweetie.<br/>- Bye, Mom.
Son,
there's something I want to say<br/>before I leave.
Yeah, Dad?
Could I snag that extra<br/>pork chop for the flight?
I was gonna make<br/>a sandwich with that, Dad.
- Ah...<br/>- Dad, don't they have
food on the plane?
Yeah, but plane food is ass.
"Plane food is ass".
Those are the last words
my father will ever say to me.
Right after I denied<br/>the man a pork chop.
Oh, God.
Wait!
I'm wrong!
I'm wrong! That wasn't it!
They couldn't find a cab...
Hey, Marshall!
- so my dad called up from the street.<br/>- Marshall!
Looks like rain out here!
I couldn't find an umbrella in<br/>your closet!
You know who probably has<br/>an umbrella?
And then, well, see,
my dad grew up in a small town,<br/>in another generation,
so sometimes...<br/>totally well-meaningly...
he'd say stuff like...
The Koreans across the hall!
Hey, the Koreans are a<br/>trustworthy and generous people!
Dad...
I betcha one of the Koreans has<br/>an umbrella!
Heck, they're Koreans!
My dad's last words to me<br/>were a string
of odd racial stereotypes.
All that stuff was really nice!
Yeah! It's positive racism!
This is worse<br/>than the pork chop.
This next clip is entitled,<br/>"Guy Playing Bagpipes
Gets Hit in the Nuts<br/>by Low-Flying Seagull".
Let's see what happens.
Here he comes...
Oh! Oh!
'Cause he gets hit<br/>right in the nuts.
And then the fat kid<br/>loses his swim trunks.
Fall off. Shorts<br/>just fall right off.
No, wait... I'm wrong.
That wasn't it.
They couldn't find a cab,<br/>so I went down there.
Hey, you were right.
The Kangs did, in fact,<br/>have an umbrella.
Of course they did.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye, Mom.
Hey, son, I just want to leave<br/>you with a little advice.
Rent Crocodile Dundee III.
I caught it on the cable<br/>last night.
It totally holds up!
Crocodile Dundee III is the<br/>second-best of the Croc trilogy,
so maybe I can live with that.
Oh, sorry, my phone's charged.
I, uh, I hear you're a woman<br/>who can get things.
I've been known to locate<br/>certain objects
from time to time.
I need vodka and<br/>dirty playing cards.
I got ya.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
I have a voice mail from my dad.
You have a voice mail<br/>from your dad?
How?
My phone's been out of juice,
so he must've called me<br/>the day the he, uh...
Baby, are you okay?
I hold in my hand the last words<br/>my father will ever say to me.
I'm gonna hit play.
What's wrong?
What if it's worse<br/>than Crocodile Dundee III?
I can't do this.<br/>I can't...
My mom is about to collapse.<br/>I'm gonna...
Wait... no, no, baby...<br/>Baby, I got it. Let me.
You should listen to it.
Just don't put<br/>too much pressure on it.
She's right.
I mean, this idea that<br/>someone's last words have
to be profound<br/>and meaningful?
I mean, who can live up to that?
Exactly.
All those "famous last word"
people supposedly said?<br/>They're all made up.
Like that patriotic<br/>dude, Nathan Hale,
from third-grade history?
My I only regret is I have
but one life to lose<br/>for my country.
You know what his real<br/>last words were?
I'm peeing my pants!
True story.
The point is,<br/>last words are overrated.
Look, think of it this way:
you get to hear your<br/>dad's voice one last time.
I should go listen to this...
alone, okay?<br/>I'll be right back.
Okay.
Hey, so, um, I heard<br/>you might have...
You heard right.
I'm getting a reputation.
So, what you need, mama?<br/>Come here.
Guys, listen<br/>to what just happened.
Judy, do you need a break?<br/>I'm happy to cook for a while.
You think your snobby<br/>New York cooking is
better than mine... admit it!
Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't<br/>you just whip up a batch
of your fancy tofu sushi bagels!
And choke on them!
- Whoa.<br/>- Are you okay?
Listen!
I'm gonna go take a nap.
Judy's finally sleeping<br/>and it's all because of me!
Guys, I have a role:<br/>I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!
Well, but this day is
tough on you, too.
You sure you can<br/>absorb all that?
Yeah! Robin gave me a little<br/>orange pill from her purse.
I don't know what's in it,
but things are flowin'<br/>pretty smooth right now.
Hey, stay hydrated.
Hey.
So?
I couldn't listen to it.
Guys, this is hard.
We know, baby.
But you'll always wonder,<br/>if you don't.
Your dad loved you.
It almost doesn't matter<br/>what he said.
- It doesn't.<br/>- That's true.
Guys, guys, what if...
God forbid...
all of your dads died right now?
What would their last words<br/>to you have been? Seriously.
I know mine.
When I was in Cleveland<br/>last month,
I went to visit my dad at his...
post-divorce bachelor pad.
Been fun bro-ing out<br/>with you tonight, T-Dawg.
Yeah... so glad we can we can<br/>talk about our sex lives now.
That's totally an improvement.
I hooked up
with a younger woman<br/>the other week...
Donna Bromstead.
My prom date?!
How far did you get, T-Dawg?
I have to go.
Ugh...
How would you like those<br/>to be your father's last words?
Well, they might be.
Donna Bromstead's<br/>husband is a cop.
Lawyered.
Lily?
Hello.
Lily, it's Dad.
Listen, I'm sort of in jail<br/>for not paying taxes
for the last 25 years.
But bright side... I thought<br/>of a great new board game.
"Tax Evasion"...<br/>ages six to ten.
Which is, ironically,<br/>what I might be looking at.
Anyway, Pumpkin,<br/>I need $15,000.
Fooled ya.
Leave a message after the beep.
We'll get back to ya.
Beep.
Lawyered.
Robin?
And so, despite the endless<br/>disappointment you've caused me,
I pray that this will finally
be the year you achieve something
of actual significance.
I'd love to stop
lying to my friends about you<br/>being in a coma.
Anyway, the point is,<br/>happy birthday, RJ.
- Whoa-ho!<br/>- Wow.
That's awful.
No, here's the awful part.
You remembered my birthday!
Lawyered.
Now can we all just admit
that last words are,<br/>in fact, a big deal?
- Yes.<br/>- Yes.
Man, I always thought<br/>I had it rough
not really knowing<br/>my dad, but...
now I realize at least
I'll never have<br/>to suffer like this.
Our next video is called
"German Shepherd Activates<br/>Tennis Ball Cannon
While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink".
- It's...<br/>- Barney, please, Barney!
No more videos, okay?
I just need a minute.
Okay...
okay, who is<br/>responsible for this?
Who got Cousin Daphne drunk?
She is 15 years old.
Whoa, they grow big out here.
And here's your<br/>phone number back.
- Judy, I...<br/>- I did it.
What possible excuse<br/>could you have for this?
I'm from New York.
We think getting minors<br/>drunk is funny.
There's nothing funny about<br/>getting minors drunk!
You should be ashamed, Lily!
Ashamed!
Mmm!
Oh, cripes, that's tasty.
Mmm! Mmm!
That salad's the first food<br/>she's eaten in two days.
Sure, it's mostly cheese,<br/>mayonnaise and jelly beans,
but it counts.
Well, at least someone's helping.
We haven't made<br/>Marshall laugh once.
Yeah.
Showing videos of guys<br/>getting hit in the nuts
wasn't going to do anything.
- I'm just stupid.<br/>- Stupid.
What we need to do is hit<br/>each other in the nuts.
Yes.
Nothing beats the immediacy<br/>of live theater.
But which one of us is<br/>going to take the hit?
Hey, Marshall.
So that's it?
No discussion?
I'm not going to listen.
"Rent Crocodile Dundee III"
are the last words that<br/>my father will ever say to me,
and I think I can live with that.
Is he laughing?
Marshall really did think<br/>he could live with that.
That is, until later,<br/>at the memorial service.
My last talk with Marvin<br/>was so lovely.
The stories his mother and<br/>brothers told were so perfect.
Then he picked my crying son<br/>up off the ice.
He gave him a hug and said,
"Champ, it doesn't matter if you<br/>fall down once in a while".
And as we hiked, a little deer<br/>appeared on the path.
She hopped over to Dad<br/>and started eating...
right out of his hand.
And then he kissed me<br/>and he said...
"I will always be proud of you".
"Life is such a gift".
"You know something, gorgeous?
I'm the luckiest man alive".
Lame.
These stories suck.
Doesn't hold a candle<br/>to your Crocodile Dundee thing.
You're up next, baby.
I just need some air.
Baby, are you okay?
I have to listen to it.
It's a pocket dial.
It's nothing.
Hey, so it's a pocket dial.
You have so many great<br/>memories with your dad.
Who cares about the last one?
- She's right.<br/>- Your dad was hilarious.
You guys don't get it, okay?
None of you do.
My dad was my hero.
And he was my teacher.
And he was my best friend.
He always came through for me.
And now he's just gone.
And what am I left with?
Thanks a lot, God!
Thank you!
You took my father...
the greatest man that<br/>I have ever known...
and you ripped him off<br/>this Earth, way too young!
And he'll never get to<br/>meet our kids, Lily.
But we got this voice mail.
Thank you so much<br/>for the voice mail!
It's a great comfort!
'Cause whenever I'm starting
to feel lonely or sad, or...<br/>or you know what,
or maybe a little bit cheated,
at least I got
the sound of his pocket<br/>to console me.
Marshall...
How is this fair?
You know, like,<br/>an entire human life
and it just ends for<br/>no reason, and...
and what are we left with?
Marshall?
Oh, looks like I've been calling<br/>you for almost five minutes.
How's my pocket sound?
Oh, sorry about that, buddy.
Um, anyway, your mom and I had<br/>such a great time seeing you.
I love you.
Looks like your dad<br/>came through one last time.
"I love you".
My father's last words<br/>to me are "I love you".
Ooh, and let me know<br/>if you find my foot cream.
That fungus thing<br/>is acting up again.
"I love you".
My father's last words to me<br/>are "I love you".
- Yes.<br/>- Yes, they were.
- We heard it.<br/>- Loud and clear.
Bye, Pop.
So Marshall finally<br/>got up to speak.
Funny thing, though...
Then my father said the last<br/>words that he'll ever say to me:
"Rent Crocodile Dundee III.
I caught it on the cable<br/>last night
and it totally holds up".
He decided to keep Marvin's<br/>real last words
just for himself.
Thanks.
For what?
I know what you've<br/>been doing today.
And I really needed it.
Any time.
That dress makes you look<br/>like a Kansas City whore.
Sorry, dear.<br/>Last one.
Oh, man.
I should have rented<br/>Crocodile Dundee III.
Okay, seriously,<br/>how are you doing that?
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
And if I don't come back,
well, then these are<br/>my last words to you all.
I really, really, really<br/>love you guys.
Now I'm going<br/>to go drop a deuce.
Last words... it's a lot<br/>of pressure, kids.
It gets you thinking.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Mom.
I'm ready to meet my dad.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, after Uncle<br/>Marshall lost his father,
he decided to stay home a while<br/>to take care of his mother.
But the longer he stayed there,
the more it was like<br/>he had never left Minnesota.
Eriksen residence,<br/>Marshall speaking.
Oh, that is too cute.
Say it again.
No.
It's called manners, jerk.
Now, what's...<br/>what's going on in New York?
Give me something.
There is one thing<br/>that's been going on.
Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.
Kids, as you remember, Zoey and I met<br/>because she was trying
to save an old building<br/>from being torn down
and replaced by a new building<br/>that I'd been hired to design.
And yet somehow, despite this,
we had all managed<br/>to become friends.
Which brings us to the night
Aunt Robin decided<br/>to cook dinner.
I thought the oven was Celsius.
It's okay.
We got hot dogs.
Yeah, and it's not like<br/>you can screw up a hot dog.
Oh, God.
This is so good.
I'm gonna finish it<br/>in the bathroom.
Could someone pass the ketchup?
I hope I can pass this hot dog.
Oh.
- Oops.<br/>- Well, looks like someone's
going out in the cold<br/>to get more ketchup.
Oh, come on, man,<br/>I brought the wine.
Which is all gone.
Oops.
All right, I tell you what...
you get this one bottle,<br/>I'll get the next three.
Hmm, tell you what... no dice.
I'll get the next hundred.
You're not getting out of this.
You want to go on a date<br/>with my hot cousin?
I'll get the ketchup.
Robin, I just want you to know,
it's either this story you're<br/>telling me or another game
of Clue against myself,<br/>so make it good.
Oh, it's good.
You see, after that night,
none of us heard from Zoey<br/>for a while.
- Finally, Ted called her up.<br/>- Hello.
So are we ever gonna<br/>see you again?
Because, if I recall correctly,
you owe me a date<br/>with your hot cousin.
You still want to do that?
Yes. And we miss you.
But the cousin thing mostly.<br/>Let's get that going.
Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.
"Cute" means "fat".
She's not fat.
"Not fat" means "ugly".
Oh, here she is.
I take back everything I said.
That girl is<br/>extremely attractive.
- Hey, Zoey.<br/>- Hey.
Ted, this is my cousin...
Kids, to be honest,
I don't quite remember<br/>this girl's name.
None of us do,
because as this story<br/>has been told and retold,
we've always just referred<br/>to her as...
Honey.
Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.
And here's why.
She is a lovely person...
warm, intelligent,<br/>just kind of gullible.
It's like, every word
out of her mouth<br/>makes you want to be like,
"Oh, honey".
Interesting.
Show your work.
My apartment building<br/>is so safe.
My landlord... he even installed<br/>a security camera in my shower.
Oh, honey.
Maybe I should feel weird<br/>about giving a stranger
my Social Security number,
but the guy's a Nigerian prince.
Oh, honey.
I just had a great TV audition.
Behind the KFC where<br/>the executive producer works
on the weekends.
Oh, honey.
Long story short,<br/>I'm going to be on Lost.
Oh, honey.
I know.
You just want to wrap her up<br/>in a blanket
and give her a cup of tea.
She's, like, this
little lost lamb
who needs to be protected<br/>from the wolves.
Speaking of whom...
Yeah, I always get those<br/>e-mails from Michelle Obama
and sometimes Obama himself.
Oh, honey.
So the night went on,
and eventually<br/>everyone went home,
except for Ted and Honey.
Wow, an architect.
How fascinating.
Why do they call 'em coasters?
And Barney.
Okay, time to go home.
Ted, a word.
God, I hate these situations.
What are we gonna do about this?
What are you talking about?
Come on, Ted, it's obvious.
Honey's vibing on me.
What?
It's called body language.
Remember when she was<br/>touching your arm
- and leaning in real close?<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Well, while that was happening,<br/>the straw in her drink
was pointed right at me.
I mean...
that's as clear<br/>as a signal gets,
so...
I'm so sorry, man.
You're right.
She's all yours, buddy.
I'd say hump her brains out,
but someone obviously<br/>already has.
Good for you.
Ted Mosby does not<br/>take advantage
of poor, helpless honeys.
Yeah, actually,<br/>there's another reason
that I didn't go home with her.
Hmm?
He's gay!
Mom, hang up!
I'm sorry.
Go on.
Yeah, actually,<br/>there's another reason
that I didn't go home with her.
Hmm?
I'm in love with Zoey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Mom!
Sorry.
Ted's in love with Zoey?
But, but she's married.
That boy needs an intervention.
Funny you should say that.
Does anyone know<br/>why we're here?
Yeah, who called<br/>this intervention?
I did. It's for me.
This is about the coffee breath.
- Finally.<br/>- Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.
Guys, just let
the man explain how it's all
about his wearing<br/>a lady's watch.
It's because<br/>I'm in love with Zoey,
and she's married,
so it needs to stop.
And... intervene.
Are you sure it's love?
Remember the ketchup bottle?
She wasn't the one<br/>who dropped it.
When she reached for it,<br/>our fingers touched, and...
I knew, right in that moment,<br/>this isn't friendship.
This is love.
Wuss.
Marcus!
This is a private conversation!
So what'd the wuss do next?
This is love.
And this was<br/>my grandmother's watch.
Anyway, now I have only one<br/>course of action in front of me:
I have to end<br/>my friendship with Zoey.
Isn't that a little harsh?
Harsh?
Robin, a single guy
and a married woman<br/>cannot be friends
if one's in love with the other.
Yeah, but Zoey is<br/>friends with us now, too.
It's not like Ted can<br/>just ghost out on her.
She'll always be around.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Okay, just shut it down.
Okay, just ignore<br/>your feelings.
If... if she asks you<br/>for ketchup,
tell her to get it<br/>her own damn self.
Look, I like Zoey.<br/>Without her,
my dinner party wouldn't<br/>have been such a success.
So those feelings of yours...
shut 'em down.
Fine.
I'll shut 'em down.
And seriously,<br/>mouthwash after coffee.
Oh, um, that's my other line.
It's not a number I recognize.
So don't answer it.
Yeah.
Oh, my God,
you are so Minnesota.
You can't not answer the phone
because it would be rude.
Well, it would be.
Good-bye.
Eriksen residence,<br/>Marshall speaking.
Hey, Marshall.
Barney.
W... what number is this?
I'm up on burners, playa.
Too many crazies had<br/>my old number,
so now I'm all about<br/>disposable cell phones.
I'll use one for a while,<br/>have my fun,
then dump it and get a new one.
And then I'll do the same<br/>with my phone.
Hey, uh, so Robin told me about<br/>this whole Ted and Zoey thing.
Dude, she doesn't know<br/>how to tell a story.
I'll tell you that story.
Hey, Zoey.
Hey.
Ted, this is my cousin...
Honey.
Uh...
Robin's version was...
That is exactly how it happened.
So Ted did his best
to impress her,<br/>but as per yoozh,
he bored the pants<br/>very much on her.
Blah, blah, blah,<br/>I'm an architect.
Blah, blah, blah,<br/>I don't wear suits.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Wow, an architect.
How fascinating.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Rambling architecture anecdote.
Blah, blah,
something about a bridge.
Blah, blah, blah...
Straw.
Coaster.
Okay, time to go home.
Anyway, I get Honey<br/>back to her place.
Who's your daddy?
Okay, can we skip<br/>this part, please?
Sure, I'll just summarize it.
Okay, that's been
going on a while.
Only way I know how.
Any-who, next day,<br/>I'm going into work.
- I run into Zoey.<br/>- Hey, Zoey.
That cousin of yours...<br/>Honey... yowsa!
I must say, your family<br/>tree has got a couple
of pretty big coconuts.
Thanks.
Yeah, we had a great<br/>time last night.
And then just hand stuff<br/>in the morning, so...
Wait, she didn't go home<br/>with Ted?
Nope, he let me have her.
I have to say, it was<br/>pretty noble of him.
He fell on his sword so that<br/>she could fall on mine.
I won't bore you with the<br/>details, but to summarize...
She hugged me.
What was that all about?
Zoey's in love with Ted.
Marcus!
Wait, hear me out, Marshall.
Zoey's in love with Ted,<br/>but she's married,
so she tried to push him away
by setting him up<br/>with her cousin instead.
But seeing Ted and Honey<br/>hit it off was
more than her gentle heart<br/>could bear,
so Zoey left early,<br/>pricked by love's fickle thorn.
But then, the next morning,<br/>upon learning
that Ted had not tasted<br/>of Honey's sweet nectar,
her joy burst forth like<br/>a blossoming flower in spring.
Wow.
Zoey's in love with Ted.
Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that<br/>new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts.
Would you like a Hertz Donut?
Sure.
Hey, where's the...?
No! Aah!
Hurts, don't it?
I can't believe<br/>you fell for that, bro.
So Ted's in love with Zoey
and Zoey's in love with Ted?
Well, that... that's not<br/>going to work.
I got to call Ted.
Hello.
Listen, Ted, um,
I got to tell you<br/>something about Zoey.
Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you<br/>something about Zoey, too.
Hey. I was in the neighborhood<br/>and I thought I'd take you up
on that beer<br/>you're about to offer me.
Can I get you a beer?
Oh, Ted, I'm so busy.
But I guess I got time for one.
Lead the way.
Oh, my God.
What?!
Fridge full of ketchup? How?
How, I ask you?
What?
Listen, Zoey, I, um...
I need to tell you something.
Um...
Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's.<br/>You want anything?
Mom! Get off the phone!
Could you get<br/>some more Bugles, please?
Of course, dear.
Marcus, hang up!
Both of you, hang up!
And we need ice cream.
Go on.
I, uh... I can't be<br/>friends with you anymore.
And this may<br/>seem strange, but...
you can't ask me why.
Wow.
Okay.
And that was it.
No more Zoey.
Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily.
I should take that.
But, uh,
you're a good guy, Ted.
Hey, baby.
We hate Ted now.
Get on board<br/>or the sexting stops.
Ted's a son of a bitch!
Oh, nice.
But, hey, um, baby,<br/>go easy on Ted, okay?
He just, he just<br/>ended things with Zoey.
Oh, I know.
But did he tell you<br/>the whole story?
I, uh, I can't be friends<br/>with you anymore.
And you can't ask me why.
Why?
Lily hates you.
You hate me?
That's crazy.<br/>I don't hate you.
Well, I know that's not true, Lily.<br/>Ted told me everything.
He... Oh, really?
And... and what did Ted say,<br/>exactly?
Lily hates you.
She hates you so much
it's hard to be around you.
So we can't be friends.
Oh, he... Oh, yeah.
Yeah, okay, well,
I... I guess there's no use<br/>hiding it anymore.
I... I hate you.
Bitch.
I can't believe it.
I really thought<br/>you and I were friends.
Lord knows I could
use a friend right now.
I've been going through<br/>some pretty difficult stuff.
Difficult stuff?<br/>What difficult stuff?
I don't know.
Well, you did<br/>the right thing, baby.
Not entirely.
Zoey, wait!
I don't hate you!
We just
can't be friends<br/>anymore because...
Robin hates you.
And that's Robin<br/>on the other line.
Oh, well,<br/>I'll let you take that.
Love you, baby!
Eriksen residence,<br/>Marshall speaking.
Listen, Robin. I know.<br/>I apologize for my wife.
She never should have...
Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.
Me?
You dragged me into this?!
You just went through a tragedy.
It's not like she's<br/>gonna call you up and...
Oh, God, that's my other line.
Oh, God, it's a 917 number,<br/>and I don't recognize it!
I think it's Zoey!
Just don't answer it.
I can't not answer.<br/>It's impolite.
- Marshall, you can beat this.<br/>- I can't turn my back
- on politeness.<br/>- You don't have to answer.
- You can just let it ring.<br/>- Good manners are what
separate us from those "elbows<br/>on the table" Wisconsinites.
You can do this.<br/>I believe in you.
- Don't do it, Marshall!<br/>- I'm sorry, Robin!
Eriksen residence.<br/>Marshall speaking.
Hi. I spent the night<br/>with your friend Barney
and he accidentally<br/>left his phone
in my apartment, in the garbage.
But I've been
going through<br/>all of his contacts
because I'm sure he wants<br/>to get in touch with me.
After all, he told me, uh...
I was his first.
Oh, honey.
Oh! Honey!
Zoey's cousin.
Hi.
Listen, um, about Barney...
Oh, yeah.<br/>He's such a sweet guy.
Who's your daddy?
Oh...
Who's your daddy?
I don't know.
I guess he recently decided<br/>to get in touch with his dad.
His mom gave him<br/>the guy's address.
So I wrote him a letter.
And I poured my heart out.
And I gave him my number<br/>and I told him to call me.
And he still hasn't called me.
Oh, honey.
I mean,<br/>I shouldn't be surprised.
Clearly, he wants<br/>nothing to do with me.
Oh, honey.
I mean,
why else would<br/>he let 30 years go by?
He's ashamed
to have me as a son.
Oh, honey,<br/>he's not ashamed of you.
He's ashamed of himself.
I mean, look at you.
You're do so great without him.
I mean, you have an airline
and three Nobel Prizes,
and you play for the Yankees.
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.
Four. See?
That is impressive.
I mean, how many does he have?
Only three.
Well, there you go.
Hey, uh, listen, Honey,<br/>while I've got you,
do you have any idea<br/>what kind of difficult stuff
Zoey's been going through?
Oh, I can't tell you about that.
The only people<br/>that are allowed to know
are me, Zoey and her therapist.
I am her therapist.
Oh! Well, in that case...
Uh, okay, listen, I think we've<br/>made great progress for today.
I got to go. Bye.
Mom! Marcus!
What's this really about?
I told you.
Lily hates you.
I think you hate me.
I think you have<br/>some big problem with me,
and you're too chicken<br/>to come out and say it.
All right.
Yes.
I... hate you.
Great.
See?
Was that so hard?
Zoey.
Can you at least tell me why?
Because I'm racking<br/>my brain here,
and I thought...
I just want to know why.
So we got Ted and Zoey.<br/>Ted is in love with Zoey.
Zoey has no idea.
Then Zoey's cousin Honey<br/>went home with Barney,
and Zoey was happy about it.
Which tells us what?
Zoey's in love with...
Zoey's in love with Ted<br/>and Ted doesn't know.
So Ted and Zoey...<br/>they're in love with each other,
which would be fine<br/>if Zoey wasn't
married to Colonel Mustard.
I mean, The Captain.
Except now,<br/>as Honey informs me...
And we miss you.
But the cousin thing mostly.
Let's get that going.
Fine, I will, uh,<br/>make it happen.
Good-bye.
Okay. Well...
I guess I'll take it.
Zoey and The Captain<br/>are getting divorced.
Which means...?
So help me, Marshall,
if you don't call those two<br/>crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.
Give me that phone.
Why do I hate you?
Are you kidding?
Uh, you're actively trying<br/>to prevent me
from realizing a lifelong dream.
So there's that.
Plus, you're stubborn
and... and... and argumentative.
And what kind of name<br/>is Zoey, huh?
What is that, short for Zoseph?
Go on, get it.
I'll have more in a second.
Hello.
Oh, hey, Marshall.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
He is?
Bye.
Why was Marshall calling?
Don't worry about it.<br/>Go on.
You talk during movies.
You... you... you
sneeze with your whole body.
Uh, to my knowledge,
you do not speak Portuguese.
Well, actually...
You're a show-off.
You better take that.
Uh, hey, Marshall,<br/>can I call you back?
I'm out in the hallway with...
She is?
She is?
Marshall, I got to go.
They're kissing.
They're kissing?!
Yeah!<br/>They're kissing!
They're kissing, Mom!<br/>They're kissing!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">NARRATOR:<br/>My first kiss with Zoey was amazing,
and complicated.
Look, um...
I know you're going<br/>through a lot right now.
Getting divorced, being single,
figuring out<br/>who you are on your own.
Someone knows how to set a mood.
I just mean...
I'm okay taking this slow.
I want to do this right.
My friends, as usual,<br/>were completely supportive.
You're doing this all wrong!
Ted, there are couples<br/>in my kindergarten class
who have moved<br/>faster than you two.
Granted, their home lives<br/>are not great.
Hey, I'm trying.
I keep suggesting these<br/>big, romantic dates,
and she keeps putting<br/>on the brakes.
Like tonight, she wants me to<br/>just come over and bake cookies.
Oh.
Translation: booty-call.
Total booty-call.
Private Booty,<br/>reporting for duty.
That's crazy.
She-She wants to bake.
Guys booty-call girls<br/>after 2:00 a.m.
with a drunkenly slurred,<br/>"What ya doing?"
But when a lady<br/>booty-calls a guy,
she invents<br/>a respectable excuse
to mask the fact that she wants<br/>to get stuck real good.
It's called class, Ted.
Wait. That...
You think that's what she<br/>means by "baking cookies"?
Are you kidding?
You're in the kitchen,<br/>it's getting hot,
you start licking stuff<br/>off each others' fingers.
Before you know it, she's bent
over the marble island,
and you're spanking her<br/>with a rubber spatula.
And she's screaming,<br/>"Stop, Marshall, stop,"
but that's just<br/>code for "harder!"
So long!
And now he's staying<br/>even longer.
His mom has been having a really<br/>hard time since the funeral.
He's waiting on her<br/>hand and foot.
But...
it's Valentine's Day.
It's not going to be the same
without the two of us<br/>watching Predator together.
I should explain.
On their very first<br/>Valentine's Day,
Marshall and Lily set out<br/>to watch Sleepless in Seattle.
You know, I saw this in<br/>the theater, like, five times,
but I never got to see it<br/>with the right girl.
Aw...
I'm so glad none of those<br/>girls were right for you.
What girls?
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:<br/>If it bleeds, we can kill it.
Except Marshall's brothers had<br/>taped over it with Predator.
Mmm.
And it became a tradition.
Wow, you sound really lonely.
I am. Earlier today,<br/>I burst into tears...
Shh. Daddy's<br/>talking now.
Loneliness.<br/>The looming specter
of Valentine's Day<br/>fast approaching.
The two key ingredients to my<br/>favorite day of the year,
February 13:<br/>Desperation Day.
That's not a thing.<br/>It's a thing.
Much like Valentine's<br/>Day itself,
Desperation Day dates<br/>back thousands of years.
BARNEY:<br/>Weddings were forbidden
under ancient Roman law,
so Saint Valentine<br/>performed them in secret,
under threat of death.
That's actually true.<br/>Wait, there's more.
This won't be.
And right by<br/>Saint Valentine's side
was his best bro,<br/>Saint Desperatius,
there to pick off<br/>insecure bridesmaids.
Whoa. Check<br/>out that one.
Her body is a perfect X.
Player, play on.<br/>High V.
Oh, Jupiter,
what are your plans for me?
15 and still unmarried.
And I thought<br/>Pompeii was smokin'.
Every woman wants a date<br/>on Valentine's Day.
That neediness<br/>reaches its climax...
what up... on<br/>February 13.
A magical night when a ten
has the self-esteem<br/>of a four
and the depraved<br/>enthusiasm of a two.
Now, there's only one<br/>thing you can't do.
Please say "widows."
Wherever you are, or<br/>whoever you're under,
you must get home<br/>alone by 11:59 p.m.
Otherwise, you're on a<br/>date on Valentine's Day.
ROBIN:<br/>Barney, Desperation Day
assumes that all single women<br/>freak out about Valentine's Day.
Which we do not.
Case in point, I will be<br/>spending February 13
with some lovely<br/>single ladies from work...
Trolls.<br/>...who could care less
about Valentine's Day.<br/>Lying trolls.
And we will be celebrating<br/>the fact that we don't have
to spend it with some dippy guy
carting around roses<br/>and stuffed toys all night.
Oh, no offense, Ted.
And none was taken<br/>until just then.
for Web-DL PeeWee
I decided to go to Minnesota
to see Marshall.
He shouldn't have<br/>to help his mom
through this rough time<br/>all by himself.
You losing your mind,<br/>being alone in your apartment?
I'm getting weird!
LILY:<br/>See, it started off
with me throwing Marshall's<br/>jersey on my body pillow.
And, well, things kind of<br/>spiraled from there.
I'm sorry<br/>I yelled like that before.
I call him "Marshpillow."<br/>And he calls me...
nothing because he's a pillow.
Hey.
Hey. How was "baking cookies"<br/>last night?
NARRATOR:<br/>That was a tough question.
You see...
Hi.
Uh...
Is that an overnight bag?
(Lily and Robin groan)
You brought an overnight bag?
You guys said I was definitely<br/>going to spend the night.
We said you were<br/>going to have sex.
We didn't say,<br/>"Bring a carry-on."
So how did Zoey react?
She thought it was presumptuous<br/>and asked me to leave.
It's-It's not like<br/>I brought a ton of stuff.
Were there slippers<br/>for the morning?
Not slippers, exactly.
(Lily, Robin and Barney<br/>groaning)
They're called<br/>British morning socks.
JUDY:<br/>This is such a nice surprise.
Marshall will be so happy.
Oh...
How are you holding up, Judy?
Oh, I'm doin' okay.
It gets a little lonely.
My friends suggested<br/>a body pillow, but...
(chuckles)<br/>I'm not a lunatic.
MARSHALL:<br/>Hey, Mom?
I hate to be that guy,
but I'm pretty sure<br/>it was Hot Pocket o'clock,
like, ten minutes ago.
Lily. Lily.<br/>(video game sound effects)
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
Oh, my gosh.<br/>That's so sweet.
I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, um, before I forget, Mom,
did you remember to get<br/>more double-A batteries?
Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie.
Right next to your washed<br/>and folded clothes.
Oh, great, okay. I don't want<br/>my Game Boy to crap out.
I'm having the sickest<br/>Dr. Mario run of my life.
Okay. I'll be<br/>right back.
I love you, Lily.
Okay.
You're the best, Mom.
Aw... Anything<br/>for my baby bear.
Get him out of my house.
Take Marshall back<br/>to New York with you.
Please, I am begging you.
I thought he was here<br/>helping you.
Well, he was, at first.
But once he saw me starting
to do better,<br/>he kind of regressed.
He's been holed up in his room<br/>for days at a time,
playing old video games.
I mean, he is having a pretty<br/>sick Dr. Mario run, but...
(sighs)
Uh, I'll talk to him.
I want to be there for him,
but it's like<br/>he's a teenager again.
I even walked in<br/>on him abusing himself.
Oh, God.
There he was, on the bed,
looking at old photos<br/>of his dad.
That's emotional self-abuse,<br/>don't you think?
(knocking)
Hi.<br/>Hi.
Listen,
that was a dumb move<br/>for me to just assume...
No, no, I overreacted.
I mean, I invited you over<br/>to "bake cookies."
We both knew what that meant.
We totally did.
I just, you know...
I saw those slippers<br/>in your bag,
and suddenly everything
felt really serious.
And... ever since,<br/>I've been asking myself,
"Am I ready for this?"
And...
the answer is "yes."
They're actually called<br/>British morning socks.
Yeah. Don't get in your own way.
Right. Okay.
(video game sound effects)
Um, Marshall, your mom asked me
to carry this up.
She turned her ankle<br/>on your Hot Wheels.
Is my track okay?
It's fine, but, Marshall,
I thought you were here<br/>taking care of your mom.
It seems like<br/>she's taking care of you.
My mom loves to feel needed.
Letting her take care of me
is how I'm taking care of her.
She's in a dark place, Lily.
She needs this.
Mom?
You forgot my chocolate milk
with the swirly straw!
JUDY:<br/>Oops. Comin' right up!
Ow. Ow.
(whispers):<br/>She needs this.
Marshall,<br/>tomorrow's Valentine's.
Don't you want to be<br/>at home on our couch,
cuddling up under<br/>a warm blanket,
watching the Predator<br/>use his heat vision
to stalk helpless prey?
(makes Predator clicking noise)
Well, baby, we could<br/>watch Predator here.
No, my mom can go<br/>rent it for us
after she's done<br/>digging out the car.
Marshall, your mom wants you<br/>out of here.
What?
Anything else, sweetie?
Mom, d-do you want me to leave?
Heavens to Bess, no!
Of course not!
But, Judy, you said...
Oh, if Marshall could<br/>stay here forever,
I would be the happiest<br/>mom in Minnesota.
(chuckles)
(mouthing)
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.
Yeah. You know, there's<br/>this new Italian restaurant
on 79th that's<br/>supposed to be amazing.
I would be happier having<br/>just a simple, home-cooked meal.
As long as it's with you.
Tomorrow night, my place.
I'm ready for this, Ted.
I am in it
for the long haul.
I can't wait for our first<br/>Valentine's Day as a couple.
(laughs)
The one we'll remember<br/>for years.
Isn't that great?<br/>Yeah, if you say so, yeah.
What do you mean?
(sighs)
Look, she just got<br/>out of a marriage, Ted.
That's heavy.
I'm kind of freaking out,<br/>just listening to you.
My heart is pounding,
I'm hearing this weird<br/>clicking noise.
(Predator clicking noise)
Well, it's romantic, right?
Zoey and I are getting serious<br/>on Valentine's Day.
See, that just amps up<br/>the pressure even more.
Boy, it's a good thing<br/>that you're sure.
Who said I wasn't sure?
I'm glad we're<br/>in a serious relationship.
Right away.
And if I screw this up,
I'm the devil,
because she's going<br/>through a divorce.
But I'm not going<br/>to screw this up.
So stop freaking out, Robin.
Stop freaking out!
NARRATOR: Kids, I'm not super<br/>proud of what I did next.
Hi!
I'm here to help Marshall.
Meanwhile, as Desperation Day
turned into<br/>Desperation Night...
God, these girls are so hungry<br/>for male attention.
It is like being a hunter<br/>and having the deer walk up,
tie itself to the hood<br/>of your car
and beg to get mounted.
ROBIN:<br/>Barney, this is
Bev and Anna, uh, my<br/>coworkers and my friends.
Bev, Anna, this is Barney,<br/>a high-functioning sociopath
and my ex.
Enchanté.
That's French for<br/>"What's with the purple?"
Well, tomorrow is<br/>Valentine's Day,
and everything is<br/>pink and red, so Bev
very thoughtfully suggested
that we wear purple to<br/>show how little we care.
I use, uh, colors<br/>to express emotion.
Purple is for pride.
It was a stupid idea.
Bev, you look at me.
It's not a stupid idea.
Tonight, we are queens.
And we don't care<br/>about some stupid,
sexist, corporate holiday.
Please!
You might as well be dog-earing<br/>a tear-stained bridal magazine
while wolfing down<br/>the box of chocolates
you had delivered<br/>to yourself at work
from your "fiancé"<br/>who no one's ever met.
Gerard is real!
Oh!
(video game sound effects)
Ted... I thought<br/>you were going
to talk to Marshall about<br/>coming back to New York.
Yeah, but, you know,<br/>things move so fast in New York.
Why not hang out here until<br/>at least after Valentine's Day?
Plus, we're helping<br/>Marshall's mom.
Uh, Mrs. Eriksen,<br/>we're running low on SunnyD!
JUDY:<br/>Is orange juice okay?
BOTH:<br/>No!
Okay, when your "fiancé"<br/>Gerard comes back
from fixing cleft palates<br/>in Peru,
maybe snatch a photo<br/>of the two of you together,
and then I'll totally<br/>believe you.
Well, he's going to<br/>Kenya after Peru, so...
Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.
Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh,<br/>Nora, this is Barney.
You want to see Anna beat<br/>him in an arm wrestle?
My elbow slipped!
Marshall, I'm going home.
What?
I'm flying out tonight<br/>before the big storm,
and I want you to come with me.
I can't right now,<br/>'cause my mom needs me.
While I'm sure<br/>it's been really helpful
for her to have you here
playing Super Mario Kart<br/>for 14 hours a day...
You have Super Mario Kart?!
Hell, yeah.
But your mom doesn't need you.
Your life in New York needs you.
It needs you really bad.
Baby, don't go.
Please come home soon.
So, you were an Olympic gymnast?
Silver medal.
Ooh, sorry.
Gold's the only thing<br/>that really counts.
That's what my dad said.
And she sticks the landing.
Why don't you start<br/>stretching, and I'll...
be right back.
Hey, hey, sorry.<br/>Oh, hi.
Quick question.<br/>Yeah.
Why aren't you wearing purple<br/>like your friends?
Oh, I told them I forgot,<br/>but the truth is,
I'm kind of protesting<br/>their protest.
Can you keep a secret?
Sure.
I love Valentine's Day.
Oh, my gosh! Me, too!
Um, is it getting crowded<br/>in here, 'cause I think
there are two peas in this pod?
Oh, you're a gooey romantic,<br/>too?
Guilty. This is<br/>embarrassing,
but every year, I buy flowers<br/>and a box of chocolates,
even if I'm not with someone.
Just in case, you know?
We are pitiful.<br/>The worst.
(both chuckle)
Although there is one difference<br/>between you and me.
What's that? I'm not<br/>saying any of this
to get in your pants.
(video game sound effects)
I miss my dad, Ted.
I miss him so much.
I know.
Um, when I was a kid,
we would spend the summers<br/>in the Upper Peninsula.
And every year,<br/>we wouldn't get to the cabin
till, like,<br/>the middle of the night.
And so, it would be pitch black,
in the middle of the woods.
And I could never see anything<br/>in front of the headlights,
but I always felt so safe<br/>'cause my dad was driving.
He was like<br/>some sort of superhero
who could just see way out<br/>into the darkness.
Now he's just gone.
And it's pitch black.
And I can't see where I'm going.
I can't see anything.
All right, okay.
I was playing you before.
But I was really doing you<br/>a public service.
It's February 13...
a day many are now calling<br/>Desperation Day.
It's kind of a thing.
And you walking around,<br/>saying you're a gooey romantic?
It comes across a bit desperate.
What's desperate about<br/>knowing what you want?
Look, life is<br/>really short, Barney.
Who wants to spend<br/>Valentine's Day alone,
distracting yourself<br/>from the fact
that nobody loves you<br/>with some sad little activity?
Um, or you could be<br/>in the 47th Semi-Annual
Laser Tag Tournament<br/>in Poughkeepsie.
I have no idea what any<br/>of those words mean.
Hey, I'm all stretched out!
Here's the first thing you need<br/>to know about laser tag.
Thanks a lot<br/>for coming out here, man.
Yeah.
Hey, are-are you sure<br/>it's okay with Zoey
that you're here<br/>for Valentine's Day?
Well, I mean, technically,<br/>she doesn't know yet.
What?
Things with Zoey
are moving really fast,
and the divorce just makes<br/>everything more complicated.
I just, I needed<br/>to take a step back.
You're not taking a step back.
You're running away.
And hiding out here,
hiding out here is not gonna<br/>solve anything.
You're just
holed up in Minnesota
because you're too scared<br/>to face reality, and it's...
We got to go back<br/>to New York, tonight.
We're snowed in.<br/>Lily got the last flight.
So, we drive. It's time.
It's time to get back<br/>to real life.
It's time to grow up.
Yeah.
Mom!
Can you make us some<br/>PB and J's for the road?
Crusts cut off.
Crusts cut off!
No, Ted. What are we...?
We're men.
Mom!
Leave the crusts on!
They forced their opponents<br/>to scatter, picking them off,
one by one, in a swift<br/>and merciless slaughter.
They became the 2010<br/>Tri-County Champions.
Wow. Laser tag<br/>sounds brilliant!
Oh, it is.
Plus, if you win,<br/>you get free pizza!
This is my teammate<br/>for tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.
Where are Bev and Anna?
Well...
So, we're taking off.
What?
Those guys are gonna
buy us hot dogs<br/>at Grey's Papaya.
ROBIN:<br/>What...? So that's it?
A couple of white Urkels offer<br/>you sausages, and you're gone?
What about the sisterhood?
Solidarity? The color purple?
But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
I thought we didn't care<br/>about Valentine's Day.
Look, Robin, you'll<br/>find someone, too.
You're a queen.
You've got so much to offer.
Maybe do something<br/>with that hair.
I'm telling you.
The power of Valentine's Day.
I'm Huey Lewis,<br/>and you just heard the news.
Well, I think<br/>I'm heading out, too.
What? No, don't go!<br/>You want to see a magic trick?!
It's late, and I have a date<br/>with my pillow.
I mean, not literally.<br/>I'm not a lunatic.
Boy Scout Troop 15
doesn't stand a chance.
Bye.
Mm.
Speaking of the power<br/>of Valentine's Day...
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on.
It's-It's past midnight.
Desperation Day<br/>has come and gone,
and you have neither gone<br/>nor come.
You know why?
You like Nora.
No, I don't. She's gross.
Oh...<br/>You like her.
You think she smells like rain.
Whatever you say.
Oh, hey, Nora.
Nora...
MARVIN:<br/>Here's a secret.
I couldn't see<br/>worth a damn, either, buddy.
I just kept driving forward,<br/>hoping for the best.
Look out!<br/>(gasps)
Gotcha.
(laughs)
NARRATOR: And so we<br/>drove through the night,
out of Desperation Day<br/>and into Valentine's.
And there was no trace of<br/>my little freak out, except...
Really? An overnight bag<br/>for your own living room?
Looks like we got<br/>a matching set.
Well, that was kind of<br/>presumptuous.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, sometimes wonderful things
come out of horrible situations.
Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong
where I got stuck in the airport?
Well, a funny thing happened that day.
Yes, I realize it's raining,
but, come on, it's 2021.
We can make cell phones<br/>that project holograms,
but a light drizzle shuts<br/>down a whole airport?
Hey, Ted.
Hey...
There she is.
Wow.
Wendy the Waitress. Wendy the Waitress!
I was just saying-- what are you doing here?
What was she doing there?
For that, we have to back<br/>up about ten years.
So, Barney, I hear you and Nora
had a fun time at laser tag.
I don't know where you heard that.
It was a disaster.
Not according to her.
Oh, my God, this was so much fun.
We have to do this again. We do, we have to.
You want to grab a drink right now?
No, I'm kind of tired.
But...
this is my number.
Give me a call.
Absolutely.
How is that a disaster?
She didn't want to get drinks.
And as soon as a girl says
she doesn't want to get drinks, well...
You want to grab a drink right now? No,<br/>I'm kind of tired.
Absolutely.
It's a shame, too.
She was a really great laser tag partner.
She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.
Please, Cheese. You like this girl.
What? Nora?
No, I don't.
Barney, you can't say her<br/>name without smiling.
That's...
Nora.
Sorry, sorry.
I was thinking of a funny thing
that Nora said. Hmm.
Stop it.
No... ra.
Nah...
Damn it, what is the matter with me?
You like her. You should call her.
Call her?
she had a nice face,
her booty was in place,<br/>but Barney don't chase.
That is ridiculous.
Barney, you know what, here's some advice.
Totally.
Kids, I had just started dating Zoey.
And when you first start dating someone,
everyone wants to know the same thing.<br/>How did we meet?
Oh, Ted, she doesn't want... No,<br/>it's a cute story.
Once upon a time...
Zoey was married to this super rich,<br/>super creepy guy
called The Captain.
So when Zoey and I became friends,
I was careful not to cross any lines.
Oh, man, this movie is scary.
I know, right?
But then one day,
Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight.
He flipped out and demanded a divorce.
And she was heartbroken.
But after a little soul-searching,
she ended up back in my life,<br/>and the rest, as they say,
is history.
Actually, I said, "How's your meat?"
Oh.
A little cold.
Gee, wonder why.
Oh, Ted, did you have a<br/>chance to pick up that box
I left at my old apartment?
Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain.
I mean this in a super manly way.
That guy scares the panties off me.
You don't have to see him.
He left the box with the doorman.
If it's really important to you,<br/>I will pick it up tomorrow.
All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big
meaningless stack of paperwork<br/>that I have to get off my desk
to make room for tomorrow's big<br/>meaningless stack of paperwork.
But it's all worth it,
you know, 'cause at least I know<br/>I'm making the world a... place.
All right, see you guys later.
I'm worried about Marshall.
He doesn't seem like himself lately.
Yeah, he's been really... quiet.
Well, that's just what<br/>Minnesota guys are like--
strong, silent, you know, man's man.
Like Prince.
No, it's more than that.
It's like, all the stuff he used to love,
he suddenly has no interest in anymore.
Oh.
Ha-wink.
Excuse me?
Lily, in my travels,
I've developed a finely calibrated sense
of how long it's been since--
How do I not put this delicately?--
a girl's been porked.
And, boo,
you've been pork-free so long,
you're practically kosher.
It's been a while.
Five weeks, three days by my estimation.
You should work at a carnival.
I tried.
They're pretty strict with backgrounds.
Anyway, we should get going.
Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.
Good night. Good night, guys.
18 weeks.
Damn it.
Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell.
Hmm.
But I just started a new job,
and dating's been on the back burner, and...
Shh.
Child, listen.
If you're really hurting for it,
I'd be more than happy to throw you one.
Throw me one? Yeah.
We're exes. We're probably<br/>due for a backslide.
Or we could just do it the normal way.
Oh, I see what's going on.
Yeah?
This is about Nora.
You met a girl, you liked her,<br/>but then you missed your shot.
And now you're trying to hook<br/>up with your ex-girlfriend
to prove to yourself that you don't care.
Robin, you could not be more--
What do you mean I missed my shot?
Nora met a guy. What?!
What?
Yep. Off the market.
He's taking her to Cafe<br/>L'Amour this Friday night.
But "L'Amour" means love!
They're going to the cafe of love!
I'm fine. It's fine.
Point is,
Robin, I don't even like Nora.
Damn it!
Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?
I can't sleep.
Mmm.
Anything I can do to help you with that?
Maybe after this documentary on garbage.
Man, I am losing my touch.
Nearly twice the size of Texas,
the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch,<br/>or "Garbage Island,"
is an enviwonmental disaster.
Sepawated from its pawents,
this young bird stwuggles to survive,
stwangling itself in the<br/>plastic wings of a six-pack.
Marshall Eriksen, I think you<br/>know what you have to do.
I have to save the planet!
Is it over? I call on top.
Ow!
A few days later, I headed over<br/>to The Captain's building
to get Zoey's box.
I'm here to... Ted.
What a surprise.
Ted.
Captain. I...
You've come to rescue me
from the capsized wreckage of my marriage.
Mm...
I hesitated calling you
because I know you and Zoey were friendly.
Pssh, nah... But my wife has left me.
All my friends have abandoned me.
Please,
tell me you're on my side.
Let's adjourn to the study.
Garbage Island.
You haven't heard
of Garbage Island?
It's an island...
made of garbage!
It's in the Pacific Ocean.
It's twice the size of Texas!
In other words,<br/>one-eighth the size of Canada.
So...
Guys, I'm going environmental, okay?
Phase one: the bar.
I've already convinced<br/>MacLaren's to implement
a new green initiative.
That's 'cause of you?
I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles
to the recycling center every night.
I threw my back out.
You're welcome... Earth.
GNB.
Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation
in front of the board about how we can cut
our carbon footprint by<br/>half for only $12 million.
Dude, don't do that.<br/>All they're going to hear
is "$12 million,<br/>" and all you're going to hear
is the sound of the door<br/>smacking your fired ass.
And some muffled laughter.
Which I apologize for in advance.
Guys,
I got a problem.
I ran into The Captain.
Ted, beneath this
lustrous mane,<br/>I wear the horns of a cuckold.
Zoey left me for another man.
Wow.
Do you have any idea who it could be?
The Captain then told a story much different
than the one I'd been telling.
But one maybe just as true.
Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy.
Blissful as Arcadian shepherds.
I was Poseidon,
she my Amphitrite.
I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis
could not have torn us asunder.
We had great big boners for each other.
But then...
enter the scoundrel.
Oh, man, this movie's scary.
I know, eh?
I don't know what he looks like,
but I picture him with a mustache.
Yes!
Limit the search to guys<br/>with mustaches. Smart.
Anyway, soon the inevitable happened.
She told me she was in love<br/>with someone else.
Obviously, it made me angry.
And that's the last time you saw her.
But I gathered my composure,
and told her I'd do anything to keep her.
I begged her not to leave.
We made love that night.
That's damn good brandy.
But morning came,
and she was gone.
Oh, Captain...
don't blame yourself.
I don't blame myself. Hmm?
There's only one man I blame for this.
Me.
I'm the bad guy.
Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story
of picking up the box for Zoey,
you're the hero.
Damn it! The box!
Baby, baby, I really got to<br/>work on this presentation.
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause I was going to make a<br/>little presentation of my own.
from now until tomorrow afternoon,
I do this, and then<br/>tomorrow night, I do that.
Deal.
Come on, come on.
Lily!
You lying little minx.
I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight
from 5:00 p.m. until closing,
reading a newspaper with<br/>two holes cut out of it,
and I never saw Nora
or this Italian race car<br/>driver she's dating.
Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
Come on, you just know he's<br/>an Italian race car driver.
No, he's not. He doesn't exist.
I made the whole thing up<br/>to see if you like her.
And you do.
So you should just call her.
Here is her number.
And I also programmed it
into your phone while you<br/>were in the bathroom.
Wow. That was a joke.<br/>You just got here, remember?
You really are smitten.
No, I'm not.
I'm Barney Stinson.
I don't get smitten, I smite!
You are totally smitten,
but you're scared of<br/>being in a relationship.
No, I'm not.
I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin.
If I got serious with Nora, it would be like
if Mother Teresa focused<br/>all her attention on
one really hot orphan.
With great penis comes great responsibility.
Okay, Mother Teresa,
throw me one.
Sorry?
I would like it if you threw me one.
Fastball, right down the middle.
Actually, if I recall correctly,<br/>a slight curve.
Careful, Robin, I'll do it.
Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm.
Because you don't want to<br/>screw things up with Nora.
Hey, prove me wrong.
Tomorrow night, my place.
Don't poke the dragon, Robin,
'cause the dragon will poke you back.
Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.
Oh, no, baby, come on.
Today didn't go so well.
The green initiative,
for only $12 million, will change the way...
Okay, I've heard enough.
Don't we already have a green initiative?
I mean, didn't we do a whole thing?
Hang a banner, make a video,<br/>Sting was there.
I thought I met Sting.
You did meet Sting.
Yeah, I met Sting.
So why on Earth would we<br/>spend another $12 million?
Well, because we can always do more.
Yeah, but I met Sting.
Well, meeting Sting isn't<br/>gonna fix anything, Arthur!
Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?
Well, he has some good points.
Meeker, you're fired!
And as for you, Eriksen...<br/>His father just died.
...nice presentation.
We'll keep it under advisement.
Meeker got fired because of me.
I'm the bad guy.
No, sweetie, just-just put all that
out of your mind and relax.
Look, I got you a six-pack<br/>of tall boys from the deli.
Hey, baby. Yeah?
What happened to the plastic rings
that held the six-pack together?
Oh, I-I don't know.
I threw them down the garbage chute.
Let's just use the handcuffs instead.
Baby, birds can get caught in those
and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish!
Weren't you listening?
Don't you care about Garbage Island?
Marshall, right now,<br/>I don't give a wat's ass
about Garbage Island.
Well, I do.
I got to find those rings!
Cwap.
Hi, I'm here to pick up...
Hello, Ted.
To the study?
To the study! Mmm.
Ted...
I know.
Know what?
I know who stole my Zoey.
No man likes to be betrayed,
especially by a friend.
You can imagine then
how painful it was when<br/>I learned that the name
of my betrayer is...
Ted...
when I tell you who it is, you're gonna...
It's my doorman!
That son of a bitch!
You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?
He always winks and tips<br/>his hat when he sees her.
I know how these things work.
He holds her package,
and pretty soon, she's holding his.
And then there's
his glorious mustache.
I will have him fired for this!
No, no, no, you can't fire him.
You're right.
Maritime protocol demands<br/>physical retribution!
Oh, my God! No, no!
No physical retribution! Stop!
Who is this flower child,<br/>and what has he done
with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!
Look, look, yes, yes,
the doorman is a scoundrel.
The mustache alone gives that away.
He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!
Whoa, "rapscallion"<br/>may be going a bit far, Ted.
But it's not his fault, okay?
It's nobody's fault.
You and Zoey
have nothing in common.
For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats!
You're just
not right for each other.
Look, I know it's tough to face,<br/>but I'm sure
a small part of you has always known that.
Why couldn't she just like boats?
Just to have one thing in common?
Other girls like boats, don't they?
Of course they do.
And you'll find one.
And you'll be much happier with her
than you ever were with Zoey.
When you put it that way,
I should almost thank the doorman.
Yeah, yeah!
And, you know, since,<br/>since it doesn't really matter
who Zoey's dating now...
It doesn't, it really doesn't.
It doesn't.
It's me. You're welcome.
Okay, baby, what gives?
I'm sorry, but neither of<br/>us are getting any action
until I find those rings.
I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.
All right, Robin,
give it to me.
Damn it, Barney, you failed my test!
You know, I- I try to root for you.
Even as your ex-girlfriend,
when you meet someone, I'm like,
"Yeah, Barney, go get her!"
But you know what? Just forget it.
You're never gonna change.<br/>I'm done trying to help you.
The number.
Give me the number,<br/>'cause I really can't tell...
Is that a seven or a nine?
It's a five, idiot.
A fi...? In what moon man<br/>language is that a five?
"Moon man language"?<br/>What does that even mean?
How am I supposed to see that's a five?
Look how you taped this up...<br/>Fine, fine, fine.
I have a phone call to make.
Barney.
Go get her.
Listen, Zoey,
I need to ask you something.
Did I steal you?
Well... yeah.
You did.
By being the kind of
sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think
of stealing someone, you stole me.
So I'm the bad guy.
Great.
Well, the story isn't over, Ted.
It'll be years before we<br/>know who's the good guy
and who's the bad guy.
I mean, yes,
divorce sucks,
but sometimes things need to fall apart
to make way for better things.
If you say so.
I'm just saying,<br/>the eggs are already broken.
Let's make sure we get a<br/>pretty good omelet out of it.
Okay, Marshall,
seriously, what's going on?
He'll never get to see how I turn out.
What do you mean?
My dad. You know,
I used to, um, I used to always tell him
that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer.
And he was always so proud of me for that.
But he never
got to see the version of<br/>me that was anything but
a corporate stooge.
And now it's too late.
And we're starting a family, you know.
Are you avoiding sleeping with me
'cause you don't want to start a family?
Lily, if we have a baby right now,
that is just it for me.
The cement will dry,
and I will be stuck at GNB forever.
Marshall,
if you want to quit your job and<br/>go work for the NRDC right now,
then you need to do that right now.
And then,
once you've cleaned up all the oceans
and saved the planet--
you know, like, a year from now--<br/>then we'll start a family.
I don't know.
So far, in the name of saving the planet,
I've ruined your night,<br/>I practically broke Wendy's back
and I got Meeker fired.
The guy must hate me.
Meeker doesn't hate you.
Oh, Meeker hated him, all right.
After all, Marshall was the<br/>one who got him fired.
Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's.
So that night, he went there<br/>to confront Marshall.
But as luck would have it...
Are you guys...? Closed. Sorry.
Thanks.
Rough night?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. It's no one's fault.
Except for Marshall Eriksen.
What did you just say?
Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault.
Why, do you know him?
Know him? I hate that guy.
Me, too.
Well, hey.
And the rest, as they say...
...is history.
And three kids later,
we decided to come here<br/>on our second honeymoon.
Wow.
That's a pretty good omelet.
Oh, and hey, what about you?
You still with Zoey?
No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well.
But it's all for the best,
'cause now I'm married to
an amazing girl, we have two kids.
It's actually a funny story of how we met.
I was a best man at this wedding...
Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you,<br/>but we got to run.
Okay, well, have a safe trip.<br/>It was great seeing you.
Hello. Marshall.
Hey, Ted.
Hey. You will not believe<br/>who I just ran into.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, the heart is<br/>a mysterious muscle.
You never really know<br/>what's going on in there.
So after Uncle Marshall<br/>lost his father,
he decided to get<br/>his heart checked.
And so did I--
and so did Lily--
and so did Robin.
And then Marshall went again<br/>just to be sure.
There was only one holdout.
I don't need to go<br/>to a heart doctor.
I drink every<br/>day, I sleep three<br/>hours every night,
and I have multiple<br/>sex partners.
I'm doing everything right.
Barney, come on,<br/>this is important.
We need you around<br/>for a long time.
Without you, we'd have to find
some other sex-fueled,<br/>depraved animal to entertain us.
ROBIN:<br/>Actually,
I'm thinking about<br/>getting a dog again.
Oh, can she? Can she get<br/>a dog, please Dad?
TED:<br/>No. If you get a dog,
I'm going to be the one stuck<br/>taking care of it.
You wouldn't have<br/>to take care of it.
Really? And who watered<br/>the philodendron
on your bookcase<br/>and sang it back to life?
Yeah, that was made<br/>out of silk, Ted.
Okay, Robin, what you<br/>need is indeed something<br/>that buries a bone,
but I'm not talking<br/>about a dog.
I'm talking about a man.
Here we go.
You're clearly trying<br/>to fill a hole-- in her heart.
You feel like the seventh wheel,<br/>because now Ted is with Zoey
and Barney's with Nora<br/>and Lily's with Big Fudge.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>Big Fudge.
"With"?
I am not "with" Nora.
Wrong preposition.
Later tonight I'm hoping<br/>to be on Nora, right?
Or under Nora, right?
Or, we're all adults,<br/>I'll just say it--
behind Nora.
(singsong voice):<br/>Oh, Barney's got<br/>feeling for a girl.
Yeah. Penis feelings.
Because she's hot.
Guys, as you know,
I only have one rule...
NARRATOR:<br/>Barney said this a lot.
I only have one rule:
if you're gonna get it on<br/>in a Port-O-Potty,
do it early in the day.
I only have one rule:
Never screw over a girl<br/>whose last name
ends in a vowel.
'Cause she's got brothers.
I only have one rule:
Never date a girl<br/>with a hook for a hand.
Never go out with<br/>the same girl more than once.
Then why are you going<br/>out with Nora again?
There is an exception.
And it was always<br/>the same exception.
...unless she's hot.
...unless she's hot.
...unless she's hot. Arr!
And she is indeed hot.
Which is why nothing,<br/>not even God himself--
yeah, I said it, Beardy--
is going to stand in the way<br/>of tonight being legend...
Wait for it.
(sneezes)
Uh-oh.
(with nasal congestion):<br/>Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late.
I'm just, uh, just<br/>getting over a cold.
Oh, no. How long<br/>have you been sick?
About 20 minutes.<br/>Can't seem to shake it.
Okay, 'cause I was going<br/>to say you look a little...
Handsome? Rich?<br/>Well-endowed?
(coughs)
(sneezes)
Huh, let's say<br/>well-endowed-- with phlegm.
(coughs)
All right, let's go.<br/>It's bedtime.
The bed-- that's where<br/>all the...
(hacking)
(noisy hawking)
...happens.
Come on, let's get<br/>you sorted out.
That night, Barney didn't<br/>take care of business.
(violin playing lullaby)
Instead, Nora took care<br/>of Barney.
Ah. Thank you.
(violin playing lullaby)
Good night, Barney.
Good night, Mommy.
Wow, she nursed you<br/>back to health?
No. I didn't even<br/>see her boobs.
She just took care of me.
(door opening)
Oh, hey, guys.<br/>This is Nate.
Nate, these<br/>are my friends.<br/>What's up. guys?
Nate Scooberman. But<br/>everyone calls me Scooby.
I'd love to hang out,<br/>but I really gotta hit the john.
Uh, yeah, it's right in here...
Scooby.
Thanks, brah.
I like you guys.
Oh, Robin,
if you weren't so much stronger<br/>than me, I would slap you.
What? You told me<br/>to meet someone.
I know, and, look,<br/>he seems plenty nice,
but I didn't mean bring home<br/>the first guy
you bump into on the street.
Actually, I met him in the park.
Oh.<br/>Oh.<br/>Oh.
Should have just<br/>let you get a dog.
Oh, oh, I should go. Lily,<br/>can I talk to you for a second?
So, um, I made an appointment<br/>with that cardiologist.
Aw, and you want me<br/>to go with you
'cause you're a little scared?
No.
Do you want me to go with you<br/>because you're a lot scared?
Yes!
Okay, fine.
On one condition.
You have to promise me<br/>you won't lie to Nora.
She seems like<br/>something special.
Okay, I promise<br/>I won't lie to her.
I may, however,<br/>lie on her.
I said, bang-bang,<br/>bangity-bang.
♪ Bang-bang-bang,<br/>bangity-bang ♪
♪ Bang, bang,<br/>bangity bang... ♪
Are we done?
♪ A bang-bang,<br/>bangity-bang. ♪
Well, Barney,<br/>your heart sounds fine.
See, Lily?
She was worried.
Although it seems like you might<br/>have a slight arrhythmia.
Ow! Nails, nails!
It's probably nothing<br/>to worry about,
but I'd like you to wear<br/>this heart monitor
for the next 24 hours.
Twen... Flag on the play, Doc.
I have a date tonight.
DOCTOR:<br/>Don't worry. It's totally safe.
Unless part of your big date
involves connecting yourself<br/>to a car battery.
Well, now it doesn't.
And exactly 24 hours later,<br/>they returned for the results.
Okay, everything<br/>looks fine here,
although I did notice<br/>a few irregularities.
There's nothing to be...
...alarmed about.
Go on, Doctor.
What happened
at 8:46 p.m. last night?
Well, let's see...
Uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked<br/>push-ups, naked chin-ups...
I was at dinner.
This might be<br/>a little forward,
but do you have a bomb<br/>strapped to your chest?
This? No, no.
It's a heart monitor.
It's a medical thing.
Oh, I'm so sorry.<br/>I've been trying
not to stare<br/>at your chest all night.
(chuckles)<br/>What's that like?
So is everything okay?
My friend's dad passed away<br/>from a sudden heart attack.
So I'm just getting<br/>myself checked out, too.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Thanks.
Um, Barney, what<br/>I'm about to say
is going to sound<br/>a little weird,
but I think I'm starting to like<br/>you, so I have to say it.
Well, for what it's worth,<br/>I'm not easily shocked.
Unless you dump water on me,<br/>'cause I'll just...
(imitates electrical crackling)
No. What is it?
I want to get married.
I mean, not tonight,
or even to you, necessarily.
But that's what I want.
And if that's going<br/>to scare you off,
then I'd rather<br/>it scare you off now.
(electronic beeping)<br/>I want a family,
and I want to live<br/>in a little house
with a garden and a tree<br/>for the kids to climb.
(rapid beeping)<br/>And I want to go<br/>to sleep every night
with the same person<br/>by my side,
and wake up next to him<br/>in the morning every morning<br/>(very rapid beeping)
for the rest<br/>of our lives.<br/>(steady electronic tone)
Just thought<br/>you should know that.
You have to promise me<br/>you won't lie to Nora!
That's exactly<br/>what I want, too.
I'm really into gardening,<br/>but these squirrels keep<br/>messing with my tomatoes.
Every time I see them<br/>in the backyard,
I'm like, "Get out of here!"
And they run off,<br/>but sure enough,
a few minutes later,<br/>there they are again.
And I'm like,<br/>"Get out of here!"
So annoying.
(sniffing)<br/>I smell food.
Does this place<br/>have a kitchen?
I'll be right back.
Okay, but you have to admit
that he is a lot of fun.
Oh, I actually think
he's quite intelligent<br/>for what he is.
And what is he?
He's a dog.
He's totally a dog.
What? You saw him<br/>hitting on someone?
No, I didn't say,<br/>"He a dawg."
I said, "He's a dog."<br/>As in, a dog.
I think we've all noticed<br/>a few curious mannerisms.
Or rather, doggerisms.
Uh, Scooby, the tag's<br/>still on your jeans.
Where?
Okay, Scooby, you ready?
TED/MARSHALL:<br/>Oh!
Good boy, Scooby!
Good job, Scoob!<br/>Good boy!
That last one did not happen.<br/>TED:<br/>Okay, you're right.
He dropped it.
He's not a dog.
Robin, it's fine.
You said you wanted a dog<br/>and you got one.
And the best part is,<br/>he got his shots.
Hey, guys, got my shots.
You are so playful.
Nice job fetching those.<br/>Guys...
Yeah, guys, cut it out.
Scooby, sit.
So, Scooby,<br/>we were thinking
if you're going to be<br/>hanging out with our Robin,
you should be<br/>properly vetted.
Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness<br/>doesn't give you "paws."
How did you meet?<br/>Tell us the "tail""
Yes, how did you "whisker"<br/>off her feet?
Shed a little light<br/>on the matter.
Did you send her an e-mail,<br/>or did you "collar"?
Guys, just stop hounding him.
Oh, geez.
No, no, you're<br/>right, Robin.
We don't want your<br/>new guy to "flea."
We're just trying to make<br/>sure he's not a heel.
So, moving from Canada,
that transition must have<br/>been pretty "ruff."
Sure was. My part of Canada's<br/>pretty different from New York.
Oh, I bet it was<br/>an "Incredible Journey""
What part of Canada<br/>is that? Speak.<br/>Labrador.
(laughing)
ROBIN:<br/>Hey, Nate,
why don't you go play<br/>some music on the jukebox.
No, I'm good.<br/>Oh, shoot,<br/>dropped my keys.
I'll get 'em.<br/>Okay.
Hey, guys, this is Nora.
Hey.<br/>Hey, how are you.<br/>Hey.
Nice to meet you.<br/>How's it going?
We were just passing by,
and I wanted to pop in<br/>for two reasons.
First, I wanted<br/>to let you know
that your friend Barney<br/>is being a perfect gentleman.
Well, it's still early.
I'm being serious.
I had no idea<br/>that deep down,<br/>he's such a romantic.
I had no idea he<br/>had a deep down.
Oh, you should have<br/>heard him at dinner.
I mean, I like<br/>being single,
but secretly,<br/>I want to have kids.
How many do you want?
Three-- one of each.
You?
Three.<br/>All in an old stone house.
Yeah, with ivy growing on it.
Cocktails on the patio.
And we must have a pool.
We?
A pool sounds brilliant.
Are you for real, Barney?
I really am.
Unbelievable.
I know, right?
And the second reason<br/>we popped in
is 'cause I need<br/>to use the loo.
But when I get back,
I'm dying to hear all about<br/>Mr. Softy here.
I assure you, that's not<br/>a nickname that I...
(wheezing groan)
And that explains your<br/>14-second cardiac arrest.
Barney, you promised<br/>you wouldn't lie.
I'm not lying!<br/>Guys, Nora's really special.
In fact...
I think I'm...
falling in love with her.
(Robin/Ted/Lily/Marshall<br/>shouting at once)
Guys! I'm serious.
I'm not going to<br/>let you do this.
When Nora gets back here,<br/>I'm blowing the whistle.
Just make sure it's not<br/>a high-frequency whistle,
because we don't want to<br/>torture Robin's boyfriend.
Guys, this is real.
And if you don't make me<br/>look good in front of Nora,
just remember: I've got dirt<br/>on each of you,
and I am not afraid to spill it.
Barney, you can't blackmail us<br/>into lying to Nora.
Really, Lily?
Even if I were to mention,<br/>oh, I don't know...
your kindergarten class's<br/>pet guinea pig?
(gasps)<br/>Mr. Buttons?
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Fine. I'll be nice.
Marshall?<br/>You got nothing on me.
The calzone?<br/>Checkmate.
Robin.
Don't say the Mr. T dream,<br/>don't say the Mr. T dream,
don't say the Mr. T dream...
The Mr. T dream...
I'm lost.
Ted?
Go ahead. Give me your best.
My life's an open book.
The ballet class.
I once took a ballet class.<br/>Not ashamed.
The 'N Sync concert.
1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena,<br/>front row. Caught JC's shirt.
What else you got?
Okay, Ted.
The thermos.
I suppose it's possible Barney<br/>has real feelings for Nora.
I do! So be cool!
There's a man back there<br/>who seems fascinated
by the records<br/>flipping in the jukebox.
Sorry, toots.<br/>He's taken.
So. How do you<br/>all know Barney?
Oh, I don't know<br/>how we know Barney.
How does anyone know<br/>how they know anyone?
(giggles nervously)<br/>I like your pretty hair,<br/>help me.
We did not meet him<br/>at a strip club.
MARSHALL:<br/>No, sir.
Because...
Barney don't go<br/>to no strip clubs.
Oh, come on. Barney's been<br/>to a strip club once.
Once?<br/>Thermos.
Nope. Not even once.
Really? So Barney really<br/>is a genuinely a nice guy.
I don't recall.
Okay, I think that we're done<br/>here, I think that we have
adequately established<br/>that Barney is...
the kind of guy that you would<br/>bring home to meet your parents.
Okay? So... let's just<br/>drop it, all right?
It's funny you<br/>should say that,
because, as it happens,<br/>my parents are in town.
They're only here<br/>like once a year.
We're getting<br/>brunch tomorrow.
Do you want to meet them?
NARRATOR:<br/>This was a big deal for Barney.
I only have one rule.
(all sigh)
Never, ever, ever<br/>meet a girl's parents.
Not even if she's hot?
Not even if her mom's hot.
I'd love to meet your parents.
It's a date.
Well, we should get<br/>going. Walk me home?
SCOOBY:<br/>Walk? Somebody<br/>say walk?
I'll go for a walk.<br/>I love a good walk.
No, Scooby, you, uh...<br/>stay!
Oh, no. I got called<br/>back in to work.
Can you keep an eye<br/>on him until I get back?
He's new to the city, and he<br/>doesn't really know anyone.
I knew it. I knew it.<br/>I knew if you got a dog,
I'd wind up taking<br/>care of it.<br/>He's not a--
Good night.
What do we do now?
Oh! I got an idea.
I was in the park today, and<br/>this guy sold me a big bag of...
NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, it was a big bag<br/>of sandwiches.
Whoa.<br/>Put that away.
You guys want<br/>to fire these up?<br/>Scooby, we're in our 30s.
We don't smoke<br/>sandwiches anymore.
Sandwich brownies?<br/>Okay.
(giggling)
Sandwiches make me hungry.
Truth. Hey.
I have a question.<br/>Yeah?
What did Barney mean<br/>when he said "calzone"?
Okay, I'll tell you.<br/>Okay.
One time Barney saw me drop<br/>a calzone on the sidewalk,
pick it up,<br/>and then keep eating it.
It feels so good to finally<br/>say that out loud. I...<br/>Dude.
Listen to me.
You have nothing<br/>to be ashamed of.
That calzone sounds amazing.
Guys, I found this on the floor.
Oh, my God.
Scooby ate the whole tray.
Ruh-roh!
Wait. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, dude.
Scooby got out!
Here we are.
I had a really<br/>great time tonight.
Yeah, me, too.
Do you want to come upstairs?
I'd love to.
There's just<br/>one little thing,
and it probably<br/>doesn't matter, but...
I don't want to get married.
I've been saying that all night<br/>just to get in your pants.
Whoa!
Oh! Ahh!
Can you believe...
Oh, my God! I found<br/>Scooby's wallet.<br/>MARSHALL:<br/>Oh, no!
That means the poor guy's out<br/>there with no identification.
Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember<br/>Scooby? Uh, well, he got out.
"Got out"? What do you mean?
He just walked out<br/>of the apartment.
Someone must've<br/>left the door open.
(whispering):<br/>It wasn't me.<br/>Me neither.
(gasps)
He must've figured out<br/>how to open it himself.
TED:<br/>He's so smart.
We should get him on Letterman<br/>doing tricks.
MARSHALL:<br/>I know Paul Schaffer's
sandwich guy.<br/>This could happen.
Guys. Get yourselves together<br/>and start looking for Scooby.
I'm on my way home.
Wait wait! Robin.
Can you pick up some calzones?
Wait-- Nora, wait. Wait.
I'm sorry I misled you.
Misled? You lied to me!
You had your friends lie to me!
I was on the spot.<br/>This is your fault.<br/>My fault?
Yeah, with the whole "I want<br/>to get married" thing.
You can't just tell someone<br/>exactly what you want
out of a relationship.
This... isn't England.
Good-bye, Barney.
ROBIN:<br/>Scooby!
Scoob!
Great idea.<br/>No, great idea!
Okay. If you were new in town
and had just ingested an eighth<br/>of sandwich, where would you go?
Of course.
Back to the pizza place!
Yeah! Maybe that's<br/>where Scooby went.
Who's Scooby?
Hey, guys.<br/>Hey, have you seen Scooby?
Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking<br/>a leak on that fire hydrant?
Scooby!
Oh, hey! It's my friends!
ALL: No!<br/>(brakes squealing)
And that explains 12:51 a.m.
Okay. None of this suggests<br/>a systemic issue.
Your heart's fine.
With a healthy diet, you can<br/>live a long and happy life.
If nobody stabs you.
Day's not over.
Okay.
Lily, I'm sorry that I lied<br/>about wanting to settle down.
No, that wasn't the lie.
The lie was when you told Nora<br/>you were lying.
Because you weren't.
You want that stuff, Barney,<br/>I know you do.
(sighs)<br/>Okay. Maybe, eventually,<br/>I could settle down.
50 years from now, if I have<br/>like a Hefner thing going on
with some really hot twins.
But those twins
won't even be born<br/>for another... 32 years.
I mean...
Nora's great.<br/>She's wonderful. But...
What time was<br/>your dinner reservation?
Last night? 8:30.
What did his heart do at 8:30?
(rhythmic EKG beeping)
(rhythmic beeping continues)
(EKG beeping stops)
(beeping resumes)
It... literally<br/>skipped a beat.
Your heart's talking to you,<br/>Barney.
Do you have the guts<br/>to listen to it?
♪ Stones that I ♪
♪ Carry ♪
♪ Around ♪
♪ ♪
I lied.<br/>Barney.
When I said I lied,<br/>that was a lie, and I'm sorry.
I'm confused.<br/>So am I.
This, all of this,<br/>this is totally new to me,
but I know it's what I want.
I want to be confused.
With you.
Mom, Dad...
this is Barney.
Hi.
I'm Barney.<br/>Great to meet you.
Hey, you want to see<br/>a magic trick?

[<div class="full-script">Kids, I bought the house we live in now...
way back before I ever met your mother.
It needed a lot of work,<br/>but I had a vision for it.
Vintage rolltop desk here.
I haven't decided whether<br/>to put the fern on the right or the left side.
But, you know,<br/>sometimes you just gotta wing it, right?
Left side. Oh, and right outside...
I want to put up a basketball hoop<br/>for the kids. Huh?
Ted, this is your seduction lounge.<br/>Sex swing there.
Vibrating Jell-O pit right there.
Rotating Vietnamese shame wheel right here.
Don't ask. You're not ready.
And that basketball hoop?
Outdoor stripper pole.
We'll just tell the ladies<br/>to be careful in the winter.
You think a tongue stuck<br/>to a frozen pole is bad.
Hey. Barney.
Let's go outside for a second.
We have a confession.
This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house.
- It's an intervention.<br/>- Oh, thank God.
I'll go first. Ted, this house you bought for<br/>your hypothetical family is super weird.
We talk about it all the time behind your back.
Yeah, this intervention isn't for me.<br/>It's for you.
Why did Barney need an intervention?
It all started a few nights earlier.
Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken.<br/>It's March Madness.
Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is.
- Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?<br/>- Sure thing.
Luis, Barney Stinson, 12H. I got a hundred<br/>bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.
You call the super for a screwdriver?
Yeah. Here's the thing about me and tools...
the only one I know how<br/>to use is attached to me.
And I am not gonna try<br/>putting it in the TV... again.
Okay. That's ridiculous.
Everyone should know how to use tools.
Well, here's our screwdriver now.
Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis,<br/>but I can't be certain.
Someone introduce yourself.
Barney, l...
I got your letter.
Dad?
I can't believe Barney's<br/>talking to his dad right now.
Yeah, what do you say after three decades<br/>of not seeing each other?
"So, how about<br/>those last 30 Super Bowls"?
Okay. Now I feel bad<br/>about making fun of him for the tool thing.
My dad was the one<br/>who taught me all that stuff.
Well, to be fair, everyone has<br/>some glaring gap in knowledge...
something really obvious<br/>you somehow never learned.
Okay. But a screwdriver?
Come on.<br/>I don't have any gaps that fundamental.
Really? I seem to recall...
Daniel Burnham was an architect<br/>whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic...
made him a true architectural "chama-lee-on."
And only the most gifted chama-lee-on...
could've designed classic<br/>beaux-arts masterpieces...
right alongside sleek, modern flatirons.
His name might as well have<br/>been Daniel Chama-lee-on.
Um, Professor?<br/>Uh, do you mean "chameleon"?
Betty, I'm pretty sure it's<br/>pronounced "chama-lee-on," so...
Class dismissed. No homework for a while.
Okay. I learned that word by reading it.
That's how I've always pronounced it.
Ted, that wasn't easy.
It took a lot of "char-acter"<br/>to admit that.
- Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle?<br/>- I'll tussle.
- You want to tussle?<br/>- Let's tussle.
- Marine biologist.<br/>- Please, no.
So this really sucks, but I'm gonna be...
in the north pole for the next three months.
Seriously? The north pole? Okay, pal.
If you want to break up with me,<br/>just tell it to me straight.
Don't pretend you're going<br/>someplace we all know doesn't exist.
Um, I'm gonna be studying<br/>the mating habits of...
Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph?
You know what? I'm going on a trip too, Scott.
It, uh, starts in Narnia.<br/>It works its way up to Candy Land.
And then, hey! Congratulate me.
Because I'm the new Defense<br/>Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts!
Expelliarmusl
Robin, the north pole is a real place.
You know that, right?
So, you wanna get pizza later or...
I think we should break up.
I still think about him in the shower.
- Hey.<br/>- Tell us everything.
- How'd it go, buddy?<br/>- Where do I begin?
So, I'm not sure how to start this.
Yeah. I think I need a drink.
Me too.
Glen McKenna, neat.
Nice order. Up top.
Look. It's been 30 years.
And now you just show up out of nowhere?
This is... This is gonna take me a minute.
Yeah. I understand.
By the way, hell of a tie.<br/>Is that Italian silk?
I love you, Daddy.<br/>I'm so glad we're best friends now!
- Make a muscle.<br/>- Hey.
Ah!
Guys, my dad's awesome!
He's the mother of all fathers.<br/>Check this out.
Back when I was a kid,<br/>you used to be a roadie. You still do that?
Not anymore.
Back in '83, I'm luggin' amps for the Stones<br/>through West Germany...
and their tour manager<br/>loses his arms bus-surfing through a tunnel.
Gnarly.
Long story short...
I've been managing tours ever since, and...
that dude high-fives people with his face now.
You're funny.
My dad's funny.
So, all these years, there's this one question<br/>I've been dying to ask him.
- "Why did you abandon me?"<br/>- "Why'd you wait so long to contact me?"
"You've hurt me before.<br/>Why should I trust you now?"
Do you...
get laid a lot?
Big time.
Observe.
Oh, my God. That took you five seconds.
Oh, was it that long?
Life's too short for chatty chicks.
You're a master.
You are legen... Wait for it.
...daddy!
"Legendaddy"!
The man is a god!
And he's still out there livin' the dream.
So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow<br/>with Bon Jovi.
I'll be on the road the rest of the year.
Oh, that's cool.
Hey.
You wanna join me for the tour's Asian leg?
This is going to be the second most fun<br/>I've ever had on an Asian leg!
Barney, we...<br/>we know you're psyched, but just be careful.
- What do you mean?<br/>- Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life.
It sounds like he might just be telling you<br/>what you want to hear.
Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.
First of all, Robin...
my dad could beat up your dad.
Second, you don't have to worry.
He's cool. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have to go renew my passport...
and get a travel-size<br/>rotating Vietnamese shame wheel.
Don't ask. You're not ready.
I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending<br/>to be something he's not.
Yeah. That would make<br/>Jerry a real chama-lee-on.
- You have gaps too, Lily!<br/>- You got nothin' on me.
- Lily, can you toss me a beer?<br/>- Sure, honey.
You have terrible aim.
That's not true.
Lily, at our apartment...
you're the one who pees on the floor.
Oh, my God. Barney's dad.
Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?
Yeah. But aren't you supposed to be off<br/>managing some tour in Australia?
What?
No, l-I'm a driving instructor<br/>up in White Plains.
A-And I need your help.<br/>Barney won't return my calls.
What do you mean<br/>Barney won't return your calls?
He said you two had an amazing night together.
Uh, that's not what happened.
- I'm not sure how to start this.<br/>- Yeah.
- I think I need a drink.<br/>- Me too.
- Glen McKenna, neat.<br/>- Milk, skim.
Milk?
Oh, you're takin' it easy. Crazy night?
I'll say.
Between you and me,<br/>I had a lot of acid last night.
- Wow.<br/>- I think it was the chili dog.
I had to take four Tums.
I was up till, like, 9:30.
Hey, um, when I was a kid,<br/>you used to be a roadie.
- You still do that?<br/>- No.
I switched lanes years ago.
I should explain. I'm a driving instructor.
Now you get it, right?
Yeah. No, I get it.
Um, but when I was a kid, you...<br/>you were this total badass.
Oh, I know. I was a real hard partyer.
Yeah, okay.<br/>Now we're getting to the good stuff.
The drugs, the alcohol, the women.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
- I was outta control.<br/>- Outta control!
So when your mom said I couldn't see you<br/>anymore, it was rock bottom for me.
I'm so sorry.
You ever bang Stevie Nicks?
Barney wasn't interested in my apology.<br/>He just wanted me to be cool.
And I was so desperate to connect with him.
I did something I'm not proud of.
I started bragging.
I bet you didn't know this<br/>about me, Barney, but...
I've published two nonfiction books<br/>about asparagus.
And one fiction.
I'm credited with inventing the word "furgling."
It means fumbling for keys.
Then all the county fair judges<br/>started chanting...
"More quiche! More quiche!"
I guess you could call me<br/>the LeBron James of drapes.
I could tell he just wanted me<br/>to be this big ladies' man.
So...
Oh, what a hottie, huh?
- I'm sure you're a real player.<br/>- Oh, big time.
Yeah. Observe.
Excuse me. That's my son over there.
I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years.
Uh, would you just write down any seven<br/>numbers here so that I can impress him.
Please. I'm desperate.
Oh, my God. You're a natural.
Think of the pickup plays<br/>we can run as a father-son duo.
There's the "Father Knows Breast."
There's the "Bush Dynasty."
The "Lick Father, Lick Son."
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't do that.
- Why?<br/>- I have a family now.
That's my wife, Cheryl.
My daughter, Carly. She's in college.
This is my son, J.J.
I was hoping you could come over<br/>to dinner sometime and meet them.
You're all wearing matching sweaters.<br/>That's cute.
Look, I gotta get goin', Jerry.
But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.
I made him wait<br/>all these years for me, and...
I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be.
I know I don't deserve it, but I need<br/>another chance to connect with my son.
We think you should give him another chance.
That's the real reason we're out here.
He lives 10 minutes away.
- What?<br/>- You're havin' dinner with him tonight.
No, I most certainly am not.
Look, I met him.<br/>He's not my kind of bro, and that's that.
Are you sure it's not more than that?
Guys, get it through your heads.<br/>I am never gonna talk to my dad again.
No, Barney.<br/>I'm never gonna talk to my dad again.
But your dad is alive...
and he lives just down the road.
- Fine, I'll go.<br/>- Awesome.
Um, Lily, keys.
I'm literally 11 inches from you.
And so Barney agreed<br/>to give his dad one more chance.
Hello. You must be Barney.
I'm Cheryl.<br/>It's just so, so nice to finally meet you.
I love that suit.
Oh, thank you very much.
And I love your...
coat.
I love your coat.
Oh, that's your coat, Barney.<br/>I just took it from you.
Well, I do love it.
It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.
Guess now we wait.
Hey, l-I got an idea how to pass the time.
- Little trivia game.<br/>- Hmm.
Robin. Reindeer... real or fake?
Okay, I'm not an idiot.
Reindeer are obviously f-f-freal.
Yikes! I'm surrounded<br/>by a bunch of dum-dums.
Good thing I don't have<br/>any gaps in my knowledge.
I am perfect.
Oh, for the love of God, guys.<br/>Enough already.
What, baby?
You've been treating me<br/>with kid gloves since my dad died.
- That's not true.<br/>- Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.
- I'm sorry.<br/>- I first noticed it at the bar.
Hey, Lily, can you grab me a...<br/>Mojito?
Normally, you would've<br/>given me crap for an hour...
about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like.
But nothing.<br/>So then I started to test you guys.
The Phantom Menace is by far<br/>the best Star Wars movie.
- It ages well. That's the thing.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
You guys like my new soul patch?
Righteous hair tab, brother!
And once I figured it out...
I started doing crazy stuff<br/>to see how far you'd let me go.
Hey, guys.
This is Rex.
He's a possum.
I found him in the trash.
He lives with us now.
I love him.
Lily, we are living with a possum.
Rex is violent. And he hates us.
Baby, you just lost your dad.<br/>None of us wants to upset you.
Please, if you guys really want me<br/>to get over the worst tragedy in my life...
I'm begging you, tear me a new one.
But not like Rex tried to<br/>in my sleep last night.
J.J., dinner!
Uh, when I got your letter, I dug this up.
You were probably too young to remember.
But this is you. This is me.
And of course ZZ Top.
I do remember that.
I climbed up on that dude's lap...
and told him what I wanted for Christmas.
Yeah.
Well, I used to love taking you backstage.
You were the coolest little kid.
Hi, Barney.<br/>It's great to finally meet you.
J.J., I'm talkin' to Dad right now. God!
Seriously, it's time.
What are my gaps?
Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is...
you can't wink.
Don't you think<br/>that maybe we should go home...
and, uh, "do the laundry"?
You can't swallow pills.
Oohl Oohl I got onel
You-You think John Kennedy<br/>and Jack Kennedy are the same person.
Right? It's...
What?
So, Barney, I understand<br/>you have a pretty big job with a bank.
Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money.
How much do you make, J. J?
I'm 11.
Oh, well.<br/>Now we all know you make excuses.
I was talkin' about money.
- Actually J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.<br/>- I got a paper route.
Good time to get into print media.
- Am I right, Dad?<br/>- Good slam, Barney.
Jerry.
No, it-it's all good fun.
Just ribbing among long-Iost brothers.
J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.
Uh, you don't strike me<br/>as the athletic type, "Jayj."
Dad, check it.
Triceps.
What gym do you go to?
Fourth period.
Sounds like you're having your fourth period.
- Am I right, Dad?<br/>- Got him again.
- Jerry!<br/>- Uh, okay.
Barney, uh, maybe that's enough.
What? J.J. started it.<br/>What does J.J. even stand for anyway?
J-J-Jerky... Jerkface?
J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.
Jerome Jr?
Oh.
He-He's named after you.
Excuse me.
I like having a brother.
You always add too much water to oatmeal.
Yes, I drown the son of a bitch!
You consistently miss at least one belt loop.
- It's like I'm blind.<br/>- Uh, you're too old to ask to see the cockpit.
Whoa.
Whoa, guys. My dad just died.
Oh, honey.
No, I'm just kidding. This is great.
I really... I really miss this.
Barney, what is going on?
- This is mine.<br/>- I don't understand.
J.J. gets a childhood, a dad,<br/>a real family and a basketball hoop?
No. No. I at least get the hoop.<br/>I'm taking it with me.
- Please, please.<br/>Just come down and talk to me.<br/>- Why? Why should I?
You're lame, okay?<br/>You're just some lame suburban dad.
- Why does that make you so mad?<br/>- Because if you were gonna be<br/>some lame suburban dad...
why couldn't you have been that for me?
Look. Barney, I know I screwed up.
Oh, "screwed up" doesn't even<br/>begin to describe...
- what I've been through.<br/>- I know! I know! I know!
I wanna fix this, and I don't know how!
Please, tell me what I can do!<br/>I'll do anything!
You're never gonna get it down like that.
Barney. Barney!
Just put the pointy end into the grooves.
That's it. Now turn it.
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.
I have no good excuse, Barney.
It took me years before I was even able...
to look myself in the mirror<br/>for the way I let you down.
It took courage to send me that letter.
More courage than I've ever had.
I owe you a lifetime of apologies.
And l... I just...<br/>have no idea where to begin.
Can you help me with this?
Oh, got it.
Look. If you...
ever feel like you're ready...
I'd love nothing more<br/>than to be a part of your life.
Bye.
# If it's not too early #
# I will come for you #
- # If it's not too early #<br/>- Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
I'm fine.
# I will come for you #
- Hey, Ted.<br/>- Yeah, buddy?
You, uh, still want<br/>a basketball hoop out there?

Are we still on for dinner<br/>at 8:00 at Valenzisi's?
That's great! I can't wait!
CROWD: That's great. I can't wait!<br/>That's great. I can't wait!
But somehow, Zoey and I were<br/>making it work.
Ted, why are you dating<br/>our arch-enemy?!
I mean, Wile E.<br/>Coyote wasn't trying
to sleep with<br/>the Roadrunner.
Or maybe he was.
Think about it.
The way that she bats<br/>her eyelashes
and shakes her<br/>tail feathers in his face?
(chuckles)<br/>She wants it.
Isn't it hard for you guys<br/>to be on opposite sides
of something like this?
Of course you feel that way,<br/>Lily.
You and Marshall<br/>have basically melded
into one big<br/>hermaphroditic blob.
And that's fine for you guys.
But some of us want
a partner who challenges us<br/>to grow and evolve.
You guys are in screaming<br/>matches all the time.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Growing matches.
NARRATOR:<br/>It was true.
Zoey and I loved<br/>to challenge each other.
The main character<br/>is a young spoiled prince
thrust into leadership<br/>after the death of his father.
It's obviously a modern-day<br/>retelling of Henry IV!
Are you kidding me?!
It's Don Quixote--<br/>the classic quest story
with the hero-jester and his<br/>long-suffering manservant!
Okay, clearly,<br/>when we're watching Tommy Boy,
we're watching<br/>two different movies.
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up!
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.
No, you...<br/>(beeping)
Hold on.<br/>(beep)
Hello?
For the love of God, will one<br/>of you idiots hang up the phone?
(shuddering)
Why would you do that?!
I-I thought you'd like it.
Who likes that?
I like it.
Your relationship<br/>sounds exhausting.
Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.
Marshall and I have been<br/>together 15 years,
and the only debate<br/>we've had about Tommy Boy
is whether it's awesome<br/>or super awesome.
That's love, bitch.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
NARRATOR:<br/>Now around this time,
Marshall had truly come<br/>to hate his job.
He hated the paperwork.
He hated the coffee.
He hated the dirty jokes.
He hated everything.
I have to quit.
Quit GNB?! Why?
I need to do better<br/>things with my life, okay?
There's-There's an opening<br/>for an environmental lawyer
at the National Resources<br/>Defense Council.
Sure, it pays less, but
I'd be saving the oceans,<br/>saving endangered species...
Saving chicken bones and<br/>an old boot to make hobo soup?
Marshall, you can't
pay your mortgage<br/>with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.
Baby, you have<br/>my full support.
Well, then, you're not going<br/>to be able to pay
for that trip to Spain<br/>that you've been planning.
(Barney snickers)
Say good-bye
to riding around in gondolas,
and eating bratwurst<br/>and seeing the pyramids.
I don't think you know<br/>what Spain is.
Well, I know that a trip there<br/>costs some serious lira.
It's dinero.
Where? I want his autograph!
NARRATOR: So Marshall walked in the<br/>next morning all ready to quit.
But then something weird<br/>happened.
♪ I will remember you... ♪
Suddenly, he didn't hate<br/>the paperwork.
He didn't hate the coffee.
He didn't even hate<br/>the dirty jokes.
Out of nowhere,<br/>Marshall actually liked GNB.
It's graduation goggles.<br/>What?
Graduation goggles,<br/>like with high school.
It's four years<br/>of bullies
making fun of all the kids<br/>with braces,
even after the braces come off<br/>and they can walk just fine.
But then, on<br/>graduation day,
you suddenly get all misty<br/>because you realize
you're never going<br/>to see those jerks again.
I just had graduation goggles<br/>with that guy Scooby I dated.
The guy who<br/>was basically a dog?
He was the worst kisser<br/>I've ever been with.
But the moment<br/>I decided to dump him...
♪ I will remember you... ♪
...I suddenly got<br/>kind of wistful.
(as speaking to a dog):<br/>He was a good boy.
BARNEY:<br/>Yeah.
I've been there, too.
Every time I'm done having sex<br/>with a woman,
at first,<br/>I never want to see her again.
But then...
♪ I will remember you... ♪
No, that's pretty much it.
The point is, you can't trust<br/>graduation goggles.
They're just as misleading<br/>as beer goggles,
bridesmaid goggles,
and that's-just-a-bulky,<br/>outdated-cell-phone
in-his-front-pocket goggles.
That one was a bummer.
You're right.
Tomorrow,<br/>I'm quitting GNB.
No! You can't<br/>quit tomorrow!
The lady with the big nipples<br/>is coming back
to give another sexual<br/>harassment seminar,
and I bribed one<br/>of the maintenance guys
to keep the room<br/>at a brisk 55 degrees!
Baby, more than ever,<br/>you have my full support.
You know, sometimes I feel<br/>bad for Lily and Marshall.
I'm starting to feel bad<br/>for Ted and Zoey.
It starts with an... "L?"
How can you not<br/>remember my name?
It's like they never<br/>challenge each other.
They just automatically<br/>agree all the time.
Well, they don't do that all the time.<br/>Yes, they do.
No, they don't. Yes, they do.
It's like they...
BOTH: ...<br/>don't see eye-to-eye on anything!
Totally.<br/>Totally.
It rhymes with your name.
And I said<br/>my name was...?
Baby, I did it! I quit.
And then I walked right over to<br/>the NRDC, and I took that job.
Oh, good for you, sweetie.<br/>Yeah.
It's a little less money<br/>than I was expecting.
I mean, compared to what I was<br/>making at GNB, it's nothing.
Actually compared to<br/>anything, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
The paid position<br/>just got filled,
so all I can do is-is<br/>volunteer right now.
You're cool with that, right?
Baby, if this is what you need<br/>to do, we'll figure it out.
How's Barney handling<br/>you leaving?
Hey, Barney, there's a bunch<br/>of models in the lobby,
and the gossip is<br/>one of them is really a dude.
You want to play<br/>"Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"
It's always the one<br/>in the turtleneck, Ted.
And no, I don't<br/>want to play.
Stupid Marshall--<br/>ruined everything.
Oh, come on.<br/>Everything's not ruined.
Guys, everything's ruined.
What? Why?
Your girlfriend somehow got the<br/>Landmark Preservation Committee
to agree to a hearing.
If they declare<br/>the Arcadian a landmark,
the whole project is dead.
The good news is,<br/>I just got the phone number
of a husky-voiced hottie<br/>in a turtleneck.
(laughs)
...so, if the Landmarks<br/>Preservation Committee
sides with Zoey, your whole<br/>project goes down the tubes?
You must be furious.
I'm furiously enjoying<br/>being challenged.
LILY:<br/>Why don't you admit that
your girlfriend challenging<br/>your every move
is getting you<br/>a little murder-suicidey?
Why don't you admit that<br/>Marshall quitting his job
and taking an unpaid<br/>internship is killing you?
It's not.
Lily, the downside
to having giant,<br/>Japanese anime eyes is
that they're<br/>easy to read.
And yours are screaming,
"What about my trip<br/>to Spain, deadbeat?"
Okay, Ted, the downside<br/>to having a woman's mouth is,
your feminine pout gives away<br/>your true feelings.
And yours is saying,
"Oh, Zoey, why can't I be<br/>on top just this once?"
We take turns!
Sometimes.
Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey.
I just had the best first day<br/>at the NRDC.
(Barney laughing)
(laughing)
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Something Hershel said<br/>at work today.
(laughing)
Hershel?
What, don't you guys know<br/>Hershel? Didn't I tell you?
Oh, he's the new lawyer<br/>who replaced Marshall at GNB.
He is so
awesome and funny
and tall-- taller<br/>than Marshall--
and he knows
way more laws.
Well, I'm glad<br/>you like your new co-worker.
There's no Hershel!
I was just saying that<br/>to make you jealous!
Why do you insist<br/>we play these games?
Barney, I'm not playing--<br/>Just come back to GNB already!
I'm really loving my new job.
Oh, and I'm loving<br/>seeing you this happy.
I'm so glad to hear you say that
because I volunteered<br/>our apartment
for a big NRDC fund-raiser<br/>tomorrow night.
You're-You're cool<br/>with that, right?
Baby, you have<br/>my full support.
MARSHALL:<br/>Thanks, baby.
(phone chirps)<br/>Oh.
Ooh, I gotta go.
The invitations are ready.
The party's for a bunch
of environmentalists,
so I found a guy downtown
who makes biodegradable<br/>party invitations
that can also be used<br/>as toilet paper.
That's how<br/>I'm gonna use mine.
Why in the world<br/>do you care so much
whether Marshall<br/>works at GNB?
Care? I don't care.
I'm like, whatever.<br/>Marshall who?
He's stupid.<br/>Hershel's way better.
Okay, Barney, is<br/>it possible that
with everything that's gone<br/>on with your dad lately,
you might have some<br/>unresolved abandonment issues
you're transferring<br/>onto Marshall?
Oh! Ugh!
You are worse than my shrink.
"Barney, we have<br/>to talk about your father."
"Barney, I'm not going to teach<br/>you how to hypnotize people.
You'll only use it for evil."
"Barney, I am not going<br/>to conduct a couples session
"between you and this woman.
She's obviously a prostitute."
I don't need this!
Ah, Lily Aldrin,
half of the world's<br/>most perfect couple!
I was thinking about<br/>that woman's mouth comment,
and I have<br/>three good comebacks.
One: your mom didn't seem<br/>to mind it last night on her...
Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor.
Would you mind driving out<br/>to Kennedy with me
to pick up this famous ecologist<br/>for Marshall's fund-raiser?
Apparently,<br/>he only speaks Spanish.
And you speak Spanish, right?
Perfect. Let's go.
Hey, Marshall, it's me.
Listen, I know<br/>I've been kind of a jerk
about your leaving GNB.
I just wanted<br/>to call and say I'm sorry.
No apologies necessary.<br/>We're good.
Good. Um, hey, any chance<br/>you might maybe--
I don't know--<br/>if you're not busy,
uh, want to have lunch today?
Oh, buddy,<br/>I'd love to, but I can't.
Oh, that's cool.
No biggie.
Another time.
Oh, my God!
How long have you been there?
You don't remember?
Hey. I was in the<br/>neighborhood.
I just wanted<br/>to check in on you.
You seemed, um, you seemed<br/>really upset the other day.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Okay. Well, um, you want<br/>to go grab some lunch?
Sure. Hey, are you okay if<br/>I invite Marshall to join us?
Yeah.
Right.
So, um...
Chinese?
You know, just<br/>because Zoey and I
are a different kind of couple<br/>than you and Marshall
doesn't make us a worse couple.
You're right.
I-If you and Zoey are happy,<br/>then who am I to judge?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God, is<br/>that how support feels?
It's so warm and wonderful.
Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.
But I thought
you liked being challenged.
Nobody likes being challenged!
Couldn't she agree with me just<br/>once, even on something little,
like... like what movie to see
or-or what topping<br/>to get on our pizza
or... oh, I don't know,<br/>my lifelong dream
of building a skyscraper<br/>in New York City?!
Well, in her defense,<br/>hamburger pizza, Ted?
What are you, 12?
You were right, Lily.
I mean, Zoey's great,<br/>but... sometimes I do wish
we were a little more<br/>like you and Marshall.
TED (groans):<br/>There he is. Here we go.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak...
whatever it is you're speaking.
Um, he speaks<br/>perfect English.
Yeah, I-I know.
Then why
did you ask me to come?
So you can drive him<br/>to the fund-raiser.
Supporting Marshall<br/>this much
is driving me crazy.
I'm going to Spain-- my flight<br/>leaves in 45 minutes.
Adios,
muchacho.
W-Wait, what do you mean<br/>you're going to Spain?
You were right.<br/>If I hear myself say
"Baby, you have my full<br/>support" one more time,
I swear I'm gonna<br/>murder someone!
What are you gonna<br/>tell Marshall, huh?
And when are you coming back?<br/>I honestly
haven't thought it all the way<br/>through, and I don't intend to.
All I know is that<br/>I'm a ticking time bomb,
and if I don't do something<br/>for me right away,
I swear I'm gonna explode!
Wow, tha... that's<br/>an evocative metaphor to use
for your nonthreatening,<br/>totally patriotic emotions.
U.S.A.!
Okay, Lily,<br/>I get it.
Marshall's been asking<br/>a lot lately.
But the thing to do is-is<br/>tell him you've had enough.
I've never been good at that.
And now, ever<br/>since his dad died,
I-I feel like it's my job<br/>to just be fine with everything.
But I'm not.
I'm not fine that
he volunteers our apartment<br/>for a giant fund-raiser
and that he's<br/>not thinking about
how we're gonna pay<br/>any of our bills
and that, apparently,
we've given up on<br/>trying to have kids.
Lil...
Look, I'm sorry, Ted,<br/>I just, I gotta do this.
My bag?
Oh, no. I got it.
There's nothing<br/>to talk about.
You trashed your office today.
I mean, you obviously have
some deep feelings<br/>you're not confronting.
And I think<br/>they're about your dad.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?<br/>Why not?
Because I don't. And why<br/>am I explaining this to you?
You're the most secretive<br/>person I know.
You never tell anybody anything.
I've never...<br/>told anyone this before.
Um...
I was 16.
I was awakened around midnight
by the sound of my father
arguing with his business<br/>partner, Andy Grenier.
As things<br/>grew heated...
I watched my father's hand<br/>slowly coil
around the heavy<br/>antique clock on his desk.
The sun was just<br/>starting to rise
over the bramble orchard as<br/>we packed the fresh earth down
with the flats of our shovels.
My dad and I
got our stories straight.
We walked back to the house<br/>in silence and...
haven't talked about it since.<br/>(gasps)
But sometimes...
on a still night...
you can still hear that clock,
ticking...
ticking...
(quietly):<br/>ticking.
That's...
the most harrowing story<br/>I've ever heard.
Is it true?
No.<br/>(sighs)
But it did get you<br/>to drink three scotches,
which is why you're<br/>ready to spill your guts.
Fine!
The reason I'm upset<br/>about Marshall leaving GNB
is... is...
Hey.
(sighs)
...the meatball sub.
Huh?
It all started months ago
in the GNB commissary.
It was Meatball Sub Day.
Oh, how I used to love
Meatball Sub Day.
And then, the most<br/>humiliating moment of my life.
Hey, buddy, I think<br/>you got a tiny little bit
of marinara sauce<br/>on your tie there.
(both chuckling)
(sinister music plays)<br/>(chuckling continues)
I plotted my revenge for weeks.
But nothing seemed right.
Then it hit me.
The answer was<br/>so elegant and simple--
an exploding meatball sub.
For months, I experimented.
More... marinara sauce.
Finally, the sub was perfected.
The plan was in place.
The snare was baited.
And then...
he quit, Robin, he quit!
It's Meatball Sub Day
today, which is why
I wanted Marshall<br/>to come over and have lunch.
But no.
All that work wasted.
(quiet sobbing)
You want to make God laugh,<br/>tell him your plans, right?
(quietly):<br/>What is wrong with you?
Hey, Professor Rodriguez,
thank you so much for coming.
Oh, my pleasure.
I have to use the restroom.
Do you have some<br/>extra invitations?
Right over there.
Enjoy.
Hey. Hey, thanks for<br/>picking him up.
Yeah, absolutely.<br/>Um, listen,
something happened<br/>at the airport. Um...
What?<br/>Well,
we got there,<br/>and, uh, Lily...
(sighs) Lily...
Marshall, hey.
Sorry, I, uh,<br/>I had to park
and-and grab some ice.
Sorry.
Oh, thanks, babe.
You would not believe<br/>how much this one has done
to help throw this party, Ted.
I don't know how she does it.
Can't be easy, huh, Lil?
Yeah. Listen, Marshall,
I-I need to talk to you<br/>about something.
No, you know what?<br/>Me, too.
Um... I want to thank you
for being so supportive<br/>of me in all this.
I've been at the NRDC<br/>for less than a week,
and I've already done<br/>more to be proud of
than in two years at GNB.
I can't believe<br/>how good it feels.
But now, it's time for me<br/>to find a way
to help the Earth<br/>and get paid for it,
because I can't put that<br/>burden entirely on you.
So, starting tomorrow,
I'll look for something<br/>with a paycheck.
What do you think?
Baby, you have my full support.<br/>Oh...
ZOEY:<br/>Ted.
Hey!
What are you doing here?<br/>This is really important
to Marshall, so I came<br/>to show my support.
This you can be<br/>supportive of?!
What is that supposed to mean?<br/>I have
the chance to build<br/>a skyscraper
in the best city on Earth,<br/>and who's the one
leading the charge<br/>to kill that dream?
My girlfriend!<br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about my lifelong<br/>dream of not seeing
every beautiful building<br/>in Manhattan bulldozed?
NARRATOR: And in that moment, I<br/>realized, though I really cared
about Zoey, I couldn't do this<br/>for the next 50 years.
I had to break up with her.
But then...

Yes, of course,<br/>of course-- anything.

this time it was Barney<br/>who did the walking.
Bye.
And that was almost the end of it...
except a few weeks later...
I am so angry at my dad!
Guess who called me today.
Go on, guess.
- Your dad?<br/>- My dad!
Barney Stinson.
Hi, Barney. It's your dad.
Look, would you like to go fishing<br/>with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?
Ooh, hold on. Let me check my personality.
Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that<br/>in a million years.
Barney, look, I know<br/>you're disappointed...
that your dad is just a boring<br/>old driving instructor from the suburbs...
but that guy I used to be... "Crazy Jerry"...
he was bad news.
Drinking, partying, sleeping around.
The party can't go on forever.
You're 35. I'm sure you're starting<br/>to realize that, right?
You do not know how right you are.
Zero right!
We're not getting too old for anything.
You sure? I feel like we collectively<br/>learn the opposite lesson...
like, at least once a year.
I have to face an ugly truth.
Jerry Whitaker, my own father...
is anti-awesometic.
I know Crazy Jerry's<br/>still in there somewhere...
but he's trapped under 20 years of lawn<br/>mower parties and carpool barbecues.
Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.
Well, this Saturday night,<br/>I am busting him out.
I'm gonna make Jerry realize<br/>he was wrong about giving up his old life...
by showing him<br/>the awesomest night of all time.
And for the awesomest night of all time...
I'm going to need<br/>the awesomest friends of all time.
Okay, who do I know?
Guys.
Do any of you know George Clooney?
Okay, my dad's almost here.
I need everything to be as awesome<br/>as possible tonight.
That's why you brought these guys!
No.
That's why I brought these guys.
I've made some minor improvements<br/>to your identities.
Uh, you'll find them on these cards.
- Improvements?<br/>- Yeah.
Bro, we are already...
the four jiggidy-jammiest dudes<br/>and dudettes this side of...
Okay, let's see the cards.
Robin, no one watches the news<br/>unless it's a car chase or a nip slip.
You are now a professional scotch taster.
Mmm!
Lily, Jerry needs to learn...
that other lifestyles are<br/>just as fulfilling as monogamy...
so now you and Marshall<br/>are in an open marriage.
- Ooh!<br/>- Gross!
Also, Marshall,<br/>you can't just be unemployed...
so you are now a gin-swilling,<br/>womanizing playwright.
And, Ted, just be yourself.
Just kidding.
Here's a giant pile of topics<br/>you should avoid talking about.
Wow. Well, this could actually be fun.
In fact, I believe<br/>it was Oscar Wilde who said...
"Man is least himself when he talks"...
- Ted, card.<br/>- Uh, you're right.
"No quoting Oscar Wilde."
Finally, Robin, you're dating Ted.
Oh, man!
Why?
I can't have any single<br/>female friends lying around.
My dad'll be all,<br/>"Why don't you marry Robin?
You guys were cute together.
Deep down you know you were never<br/>happier than when you were with her."
Uh, no, thanks.
Hey, Barney,<br/>love the new identities. Little thing...
Instead of being a naked super ninja...
can I be Meryl Streep<br/>in The Devil Wears Prada?
How good was that movie?
- So good!<br/>- Adrian Grenier!
And... hence new identities.
And so, Barney's dad finally showed up.
Jerry, you remember Marshall.<br/>He's a well-known writer.
Playwright. We're all writers.
Just some of us don't know<br/>what our story is yet.
Lily, his wife.
Well, most nights.
Mama don't let no ring<br/>get in the way of a good time.
That's a little depressing.
Uh, hi again. Ted.
Oh, and, Jerry, uh,<br/>you remember my girlfriend.
Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.
Wait, wait.<br/>Jerry, I gotta tell you the truth.
Guys, I'm gonna tell him.

Ow! Yeah!
So, Saturday night!
Time to cut loose, right?
Who wants to split a beer?
Oh, we're not drinking here.
Tonight we're going big. Let's see.
What club should we hit first?
There's Club Was. There's Wrong.
Um, those places shut down<br/>a long time ago.
- Oh, no.<br/>- Oh No shut down too.
- There's Where.<br/>- Where's Where?
Where's where Was was, isn't it?
No, Was wasn't where Where was.<br/>Was was where Wrong was.
- Right?<br/>- Okay.
Not Okay. That place is lame.
Okay is Lame? I thought Lame<br/>was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?
That's wrong. That's Not Wrong.
- Guys, focus.<br/>- I like Focus. Let's go there.
- Where?<br/>- Not Where, Focus.
I thought Focus was closed.
No, Was was closed.
Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.
- So Closed is open.<br/>- No, Closed is closed.
I don't know! Third base! Right?
Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.
- I'll go anyplace, okay?<br/>- Not Okay. Okay is lame.
Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.
- Guys, shut up.<br/>- No, Shut Up shut down.
I can't believe I don't know<br/>the clubs anymore.
Guys, just pick a club. Okay?
- Not Okay!<br/>- Okay is lame!
Gay bar!
For the record, um, I was<br/>in there once by accident.
I'm pretty sure it's pronounced "La-may."
It's Hopeless, isn't it?
Wow.
A lot of these girls are young enough<br/>to be our daughters.
I know. Daddy's home.
And Granddaddy's home!
Tonight rocks so hard!
I might be allergic to this stamp.
Oh, my God. My secret crush is here.
Mila Kunis?
No, my secret crush.
We met a few years ago.
Hi. I could use a woman's opinion.
Is this workin' for me?
Uh, no.
The only good thing about<br/>how ugly that shirt is...
is that it distracts from<br/>how terribly it fits you.
I was trying on the pants.
Oh.
I had to leave before we could<br/>finish talking, so that was it.
You know, ever since then, I've always...
Oh, my God. He's coming over.
Oh, hello.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
A few years ago at a department store,<br/>did you embarrass the hell out of me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must have me confused<br/>with the shirt you were wearing that day.
I should be so lucky.
Hi. I'm Ted. Robin's boyfriend!
- Nice to meet you.<br/>- Right.
Um, really nice to see you again.
- Mmm, you too.<br/>- Yeah.
You owe me one.
Dad, isn't this place great?
Uh, I don't know. l-It's so loud!
And so bourgeois!
Many of my plays are about the bourgeois.
And ennui.
And one rock opera...
about a frozen-yogurt shop.
Uh, Lily, uh, talk<br/>about your open marriage.
Okay. Well, after a long day<br/>of style meetings and photo shoots...
and being way too mean to my assistant...
I sometimes bang an underwear model.
My goodness.
I sleep around too.
Just as much. A little more even.
Oh, uh, only 'cause<br/>you have nothing to do all day.
Are we having this fight again?
Writing plays is a real job!
I work 90 hours a week<br/>subsidizing your "real job."
- I won a Tony!<br/>- I brought French cooking to America!
- What?<br/>- Let's do shots!
Uh, no, thank you, Barney.
I have that fishing trip<br/>with J.J. early tomorrow.
- I better take it easy.<br/>- No!
Don't you remember<br/>what you said to me when I was a kid?
"Never stop partying!"
I said that? To a six-year-old?
I don't remember that.
You don't remember the last thing you<br/>said to me when I was a kid?
You know, why don't you just go back home?
But I want to hang out with you.
Yeah, well, I want to hang out<br/>with Crazy Jerry...
not Stay-At-Home Jerome.
Fine.
You want Crazy Jerry?
There! You got him!
I apologize. It might take<br/>a few minutes to kick in.
Hey, sugar!
Five beers for the table...
a Seven and Seven for me...
and your 10 digits for this guy here!
Tonight Crazy Jerry<br/>gonna burn this disco down!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Can you believe it? This is awesome!
Barney, how is that awesome?
I finally know what it's like<br/>to be embarrassed by my dad.
So, you really believe...
that if we were in an open marriage...
that you would do better than me?
Hey, you do better than me<br/>at a lot of other things.
Like... digesting dairy<br/>and reaching for stuff.
Okay, you know what? Game on.
If I can score five numbers<br/>before you can...
then we have sex in the bathroom.
But if you can score<br/>five numbers before me...
then we have sex in the bathroom.
So our usual wager?
Deal.
Hey, uh... Hey, Jerry.
You, you really wanna<br/>be out here like this?
Oh, sorry,<br/>small town preacher from the Midwest.
Is there a law against dancing?
No, of course not. I just...
Oh, this club blows!
Let's hit the greatest party in the world...
the streets of New York!
- Yeah!<br/>- Yes! Let's do it!
Maybe fix the tie.
But mostly party!
Okay, Jerry's gone. Let's break up.
Okay.
I would've stolen you a whole orchestra.<br/>There. What's the rush?
Well, that guy who came over here<br/>who thinks we're dating...
I kinda have a crush on him.<br/>Can you help me clear it up?
Really? That guy? He was like a four.
A four?
God, you are like<br/>the worst judge of guys ever.
If he is a four, what are you?
Hey, I'm not perfect.<br/>I'm an eight... and a half.
You're a doofus and a half.
Fine. Let's go talk to him.
Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?
Uh, at a close-out sale at Dawes.
Oh, really? I remember that sale.
Hey, Robin.
Oh, Ted. Oh, no.
Look what I just bought.
Right? Right?
Hold on. We were dating then.
I specifically remember<br/>because we had great sex that ni...
Great sex.
Mmm. Let me guess.
Someone wants to knock boots.
Boots.
Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.
All right.
- Oh, oh, stop.<br/>- What?
Stop. Perfect.
But I can't see, and you can't see me.
Yeah. Yeah, just like that.
You were picturing your crush!
Well, somebody had to...
Okay. Okay. Answer me this.
Are you absolutely sure<br/>it had nothing whatsoever...
to do with the boots?
Yes.
You hear that everybody? She said yes!
We're getting married!
I love this girl.<br/>I'm never letting her go.
Mmm!
Hey. Bottoms up, amigo!
After that, Barney's<br/>memory of the night got a little hazy.
You wanna fight me?
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!
You don't even... know.
Hey, hey, hey! Here we go!
Look what I just ripped out of the ground!
I just puked on the hood of that...
police car.
Too bad your playwright friend<br/>isn't a lawyer.
Barney, I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid this is what it's like<br/>hanging out with Crazy Jerry.
It's okay, Dad.
I never thought tonight<br/>would be so awesomel
So, next stop... strip club.
The Lusty Leopard has a special...
- Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!<br/>- What?
I told you I don't party anymore,<br/>and you wouldn't take no for an answer.
So...
I used a little sleight of hand...
to make you think otherwise.
- Here ya go.<br/>- Whoa!
Bottoms up, amigo!
But all those crazy things you did.
You happen to remember<br/>what a magician's best friend is?
A drunk audience.
You wanna fight me?
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!
You don't even... know.
I can't...
Look.
Look what I just ripped out of the ground!
No!
What just happened?
I just puked on the hood of that...
police car.
But why do all those things?
I figured if I showed you what<br/>"never stop partying" really looked like...
you'd realize you can't do it forever.
Oh, well.
You lied to me all night<br/>for your own selfish reasons?
Daddy!
I wanted to hang out with you.<br/>You're my son.
And since you didn't want to come<br/>with me and J.J. on that fishing trip...
Fishing trip.
I'll never make it back in time now.
Hey, you know,<br/>a pretty good magician like you...
probably knows how to, say,<br/>get out of a standard set of handcuffs.
Perhaps.
Well, here's something you didn't know.
I'm a pretty good magician too.
- Abracadabra!<br/>- Hoo-hoo!
- Congratulations.<br/>- Oh, hey! Thank you so much.
We're super excited. We're thinking June.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay, jerk.
Do you remember how you ended up buying<br/>those red cowboy boots?
Wow. Wardrobe malfunction<br/>at the O.K. Corral.
I mean, who in their right mind<br/>would ever...
You would look so totally hot in those.
Do you have these in a size 11?
So get off the field at the Superdome,<br/>because you ain't no Saint.
Hello.
- I have...<br/>- Oh!
Hi, Robin.
Could I have your phone number?
- We need someplace to hide.<br/>- Where?
No, Jerry. This is not the time<br/>to go to another club.
We've gotta get you back home<br/>in time for that trip.
There's no more trains. There's no cabs.
Well, I do have<br/>a few driving students in the city.
- Step on it!<br/>- Do not step on it.
- Jerry, we have got to get you home...<br/>- 10:00 and 2:00.
in time for that fishing trip!
- The laws are there to...<br/>- This is no time for laws!
- Buckle up, Barney.<br/>- I'm not going to buckle up!
I am your father! You will listen to me!
Hey, how's the open marriage going?
Who was the first to get to five numbers?
I won that race.<br/>My prize... sex in the bathroom.
And I won that race.
Sorry that secret crush<br/>didn't work out for you.
Oh, it's okay.
- I guess it just wasn't meant to be.<br/>- Mmm.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.
Good night.
Saw that girl again.
And guess what? She's engaged.
So that's the end of that.
It wasn't the end that. More on that later.
And her fianc?? The guy's like a two.
How did you do it?
Do what?
How did you become this?
I mean, I love my life, but...
I'm not sure I like loving it.
Sure, strip clubs...
You're drifting.
Hey, I'm trying to open up to you.
No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting!
Go on, Barney.
When I think about going<br/>for anything more than that...
I look at my life and who I am, and...
I'm too far gone.
I'm broken.
Son...
I was far more broken than you'll ever be,<br/>and look at me now.
Don't get me wrong.
Settling down is a challenge.
It's the biggest challenge of your life.
So how do you do it?
A magician never<br/>reveals his greatest trick.
But I'll give you a hint.
You gotta meet the right girl.
Who knows?
Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.
Maybe I've met her already.
And park. And emergency brake.
I did have a good time tonight.
And, hey, if you wanna go fishing,<br/>we got room in the boat.
Maybe some other time.
Okay.
Oh, and, uh...
thanks for taking such good care of this.
It means a lot to me<br/>that you kept it safe all these years.
I'm going fishing with my dad.
This...
sucks.
English - US - SDH<br/></div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, when your Uncle Marshall...
finally quit Goliath National Bank<br/>to do something better with his life...
he left on great terms with his boss.
Good luck, Marshall.<br/>And promise you'll list me as a reference.
Which made Marshall's big interview...
with a respected environmental organization<br/>all the more confusing.
I'm sorry. I don't think you're<br/>the kind of person we're looking for.
I just got off the phone<br/>with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.
Oh, yeah. I worked with Marshall Eriksen.
At least I did when he actually showed up.
Marshall! Hey, it's... it's 2:30.
If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it<br/>if you tried to get here at least before lunch.
Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.
Oh! Mr. Eriksen,<br/>you're not wearing any pants.
Your move.
But, Marshall,<br/>what... what about the environment?
Screw the environment!
- "Screw the environment"?<br/>- Oh, yeah.
We fired him when we caught him<br/>clubbing a seal in his office...
with an even cuter seal.
Guy's a maniac.
He's just an awful, flatulent racist.
- Sir, none of that is...<br/>- Sorry. Interview over.
And so Marshall stormed<br/>over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.
If you wanna get back at those jerks,<br/>I have a proposition for you.
Invitations<br/>for the demolition of the Arcadian.
As head of the project,<br/>I get to decide how we knock it down.
I'm torn between training an actual coyote...
to use an Acme dynamite plunger...
or hooking up a fuse<br/>to Eddie Van Halen's guitar...
that goes off the second he hits<br/>the last note to "Hot For Teacher."
Barney! Barney! Bar...
No. No. I'm gonna go coyote.
While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote...
wearing a little hard hat more than me...
remember, Zoey's protest<br/>could still shut your whole project down.
Oh, come on!<br/>Zoey's not shutting anything down...
standing out there with her stupid megaphone,<br/>screaming in the wind...
butt cheeks trembling with fury...
her perky breasts heaving...
her self-righteous nipples...
Dude, that's my girlfriend.
Point is, we are takin' her<br/>and the Arcadian down.
- Am I right, Teddy Westside?<br/>- You know it!
- Ha-ha!<br/>- Okay, see, that's so weird to me.
That one second you're defending Zoey...
and the next you're talking<br/>about her going down.
Glad to know she's also mouthy<br/>in a good way.
What up?
Dude, that's his girlfriend.
Isn't it tough dating the woman...
that's trying to prevent your building<br/>from being built?
At first, yes, but we figured out<br/>a great way to deal with it.
We never talk about it.
And since then, we've really<br/>been enjoying each other's company.
So, every time the Arcadian comes up...
you guys just awkwardly change the subject?
Yeah. But you'd be surprised.<br/>Doesn't even come up that often.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Hey!
Meet the new lawyer I hired<br/>to help save the Arcadian.
So, Oprah's retiring. Oof!
What's that world gonna be like?
Wait. Marshall's helping you<br/>save the Arcadian now?
Yeah. Having a former GNB employee<br/>on our side is huge for us.
- GNB is goin' down.<br/>- Totally.
So they found water on Mars. What?
Listen, I hate to go up against<br/>my two best friends...
but I really... I really need this right now.
I mean, we're cool, right?
Not only do you quit the job<br/>I stuck my neck out to get you...
now you sabotage the project<br/>I'm in charge of?
Is this because I brushed Lily's boob<br/>with my elbow the other day?
- That was on purpose!<br/>- What now?
- This is really crossing the line.<br/>- Barney, please...
And thus began an all-out war...
- between Barney and Marshall.<br/>- Get used to it!
Delivery from Mr. Stinson.
Barney sent us pictures of himself.
Oh, God.<br/>What's he doing to that megaphone?
Ugh.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Later, back at the bar,<br/>another war was just beginning.
Babe, can I get you a drink?
No. I'm still not ready<br/>to put my mouth on anything yet.
I know.
You know what? Screw this. Game on.
Can you believe this one? Wants our booth.
Keeps giving us the walk-by.
That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.
The walk-by with the stink-eye.
The stink-eye walk-by?
Aw, hell, no!
I hope this drink isn't teething,<br/>'cause it's about to get nursed.
Barney, your wife just called from the hospital.
- It's a boy!<br/>- Look...
This went on for days.
Congratulations.
You're about to be the 250th girl<br/>that Barney has slept with.
Try 283.
250 was months ago. No, no, no.
I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, no!
Oh, bye-bye.
Mr. Stinson, I had to rush down<br/>as soon as I got your results.
I'm sorry, but your crabs...<br/>have super herpes.
Oh, boy. Look who's back.
Look, Lily. I think this girl wants our seat.
Should we leave<br/>or stay here Lionel Richie style...
"All Night Long"?
Excuse me, waitress. I'll have a mojito.
And you'll have a no-seat, ho!
Oh!
Ah, yes. The sweet, smoky taste of victory.
Are you sure it doesn't taste<br/>like anything else?
That's it!
Kent, Kent!
Oh, God!<br/>Why would you do that to your own jacket?
That's what you get, you traitor!
- Oh, really?<br/>- Yeah, really.
- Really?<br/>- Yeah. Re...
Okay! Enough! You guys are outta here.
- Come on!<br/>- Ejected.
I meant all of you!<br/>You're all banned from the bar! Out!
- Carl!<br/>- Carl.
This has nothing to do with us.<br/>It's totally ridiculous.
Don't look, baby. Just don't look.
Come on.
This stupid feud isn't gonna end...
until Marshall and Barney<br/>finally talk about their feelings, cry...
and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.
Man, what are we gonna do without her?
Oh!
Oprah.
Wait. You know what?<br/>These guys are not gonna get all mushy sober.
We need to get these bitches drunk.
Yes, but the right kind of drunk.
Uh, we should go with something mellow.<br/>Maybe red wine?
Oh, I don't know. Red wine<br/>has kind of an odd effect on Barney.
He reaches a point of sad clarity.
Ten, nine, eight...
- I'm a B-plus.<br/>- seven, six...
My whole life I was hoping to be an "A,"<br/>and I'm a B-plus.
...three, two, one!<br/>- And I'm okay with that.
Happy New Year!
If we want them to open up,<br/>I say we go straight-up gin.
Ooh. Last time Marshall got gin drunk...
- was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to.<br/>- Mmm.
Marshall almost got in a fight that night.
Look at this meatball.
He's headed right towards me,<br/>showin'me no respect.
Well, if he wants to play chicken,<br/>this rooster ain't backin'downl
Oh. Mirror.
- How about martinis?<br/>- Absolutely not.
I'm not going anywhere<br/>near you and a martini.
Why not?
- Mmm. Know what would be stupid?<br/>- Ooh.
If we made out. That would be so stupid.
Hey, I dare you guys<br/>to dare us to make out.
Every time.
I only say that<br/>because it would be so stupid if we did.
- So stupid.<br/>- Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah?<br/>Well, what about you and absinthe?
I don't know.<br/>We could have water, soda, purple stuff.
We're a dream a baby's having.
A dream that babies have.
- I keep telling you, that didn't...<br/>- It happened, and it changed me.
- How about daiquiris?<br/>- Maybe.
When Marshall has daiquiris...
he gets really into how beautiful he is.
Hey.
I dare you guys to dare us to make out.
Hey, Marsh, you know<br/>that's another mirror, right?
- Peppermint schnapps?<br/>- No!
- Peppermint schnapps turns Barney<br/>into Richard Dawson.<br/>- Who?
The crazy old host of Family Feud who<br/>greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.
Hey there, darlin'.
How you doin'?
Hi. Is this your sister? Mmm, mmm.
Beautiful! Mmm. Mmm.
- Hey, where are our chicken wings?<br/>- Show me "chicken wings"!
Ah! Good order, Ted!
Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey,<br/>then we're off.
- See ya Sunday.<br/>- Oh, wait, Ted.
Do you have a specific reaction<br/>to any kind of alcohol?
Bourbon. When I drink bourbon...
I get weirdly good at beatboxing.
Peace. I'm out.
Yeah!
Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you...
but the bourbon<br/>only makes it sound good to you.
Pa-choo!
Pa-choo!
Ki-ki-ki-ki, ki-ki-ki-ki!
Ka-ka-ka-ka, ka-ka-ka-ka!
Koo-koo-koo-koo, koo-koo-koo-koo!
Poom!
Peace. I'm out.
You had to take that away from me,<br/>didn't you?
Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard.
Hopefully, by the time you get back,<br/>we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.
- What do you mean?<br/>- Barney and Marshall's feud<br/>got us banned from the bar.
We lost our booth.
- Oh...<br/>- Stop.
Man, how did things get so screwed up?
Of course, I knew<br/>the answer to that... I was dating her.
But I wasn't about to ruin<br/>our first big romantic weekend away...
by bringing up the one topic<br/>we agreed was completely off-limits.
- You and the Arcadian are ruining my life!<br/>- What?
- I thought we weren't talking about...<br/>- We're talking about this.
Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me<br/>from fulfilling a lifelong dream.
That's just being in a relationship.
But now you turn<br/>my best friend against me?
Marshall made his own choice.<br/>Why aren't you mad at him?
Because he's going through a lot right now.
He's looking for something to believe in,<br/>and you took advantage of that.
You're just like those Internet swindlers<br/>who tricked him into paying 300 bucks...
for a lock of Sasquatch fur.
You cannot compare the Arcadian...
to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair.
The Arcadian is a beautiful,<br/>magnificent hotel.
Okay. You know what?<br/>We're settling this once and for all.
Okay. We've cross-referenced<br/>every alcohol...
with Marshall and Barney's reaction.
What's the right drink for this situation?
Well, they're not talking.<br/>They're not even looking at each other.
God, it reminds me of those awkward Sunday<br/>dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress.
Families, right?
- Oh.<br/>- l-I guess.
That seems like a whole other thing.
We need a drink that will start a fight.
Do you know what I had to do<br/>to get you that job?
Do you know what I had to do<br/>to will myself to show up every day?
What? Wear a wrinkled suit and not<br/>give a damn about what your hair looked like?
I showed up with wet hair oncel Once!
Fine. I'm trying to say...
Well, here we are.
I had a reservation<br/>at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean...
but, uh, how can that compete<br/>with such a beautiful...
magnificent hotel?
Welcome to the Arcadian.
So here's the deal.
If you can last until sunrise<br/>in your precious Arcadian...
I'll join your side.
You're on. This place is fantastic.
- Oh.<br/>- They even left a chocolate on the pillow.
That's not a chocolate.
- How dare you!<br/>- Why do you keep making up<br/>everything about...
Okay, now we need to get them something<br/>that will make them...
emotionally vulnerable<br/>and completely, pathetically honest.
Yeah, we need a drink that...<br/>that takes subtext and turns it into text.
Yeah.
See, ever since the death of my father...
I have been drawn<br/>to the idea of preservation.
That's why the Arcadian speaks to me.
Ever since my father<br/>walked out on my childhood...
I've had serious abandonment issues.<br/>You walking out on me like that...
- I didn't even think of that.<br/>- It made me wonder what could<br/>I have done to make him stay.
You didn't do anything wrong.<br/>It wasn't you, Barney.
That's what everyone keeps saying,<br/>but people just keep leaving me!
- Wow, that got real o'clock.<br/>- Yeah.
We need to get them up and having fun.
Dance, my puppets, dance.
Now do you see why I'm always<br/>interfering in other people's lives?
Oh, God. Totally.
No.
Well, we're here for the night.
Might as well have some fun.<br/>Care to join me?
Dust just flew out of that comforter<br/>in the shape of a skull.
Ooh, something just passed through me.
Can you get S.T.D.'s<br/>from the ghost of a prostitute?
- Hey!<br/>- What are you doing in our bathroom?
This bathroom for entire floor!
Okay. Final round.
What simple act will get the boys<br/>to finally forgive each other?
Sharing a brandy.
Which is what I walked into<br/>my parents doing once.
Brandy was my father's mistress.
Parents, right?
Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie.
- Where'd they go?<br/>- Oh, no.
- They did shots.<br/>- What... What is it?
What's the worst thing<br/>they could possibly drink right now?
Your place or mi...
Your place or mi...
Let's go to your place.
Kids, don't drink tequila.
These were supposed to be<br/>for a romantic dinner on our balcony...
as we were serenaded by<br/>the sounds of the ocean.
But I guess we'll have to settle<br/>for what sounded like...
two very large men having sex next door...
with a third very small man.
I think that small man sounded very moved<br/>by the Arcadian's beauty.
Okay. What is it?<br/>And don't give me, "It's beautiful."
Don't give me, "It's magnificent."
What is it about this place<br/>that makes you so passionate to save it?
Uh...
Well...
when I was a little girl...
my family used to live here.
Why-Why have you never told me that?
I never tell anyone that.
It makes it sound like it would be impossible<br/>for me to be objective...
but...
the truth is, l...
I loved growing up here.
We had just moved to New York.
We were completely broke.
But my mom told my sisters and me<br/>that the Arcadian was a castle...
and we believed her.
I know it's not what it used to be...
but this building is a part of who I am.
That's why I want so badly...
for you to like it too.
Kids, you never<br/>forget the first time, or place...
you tell a girl...
I love you.
I love you too.
Come on in. You're unbanned.
I gave these guys some drinks,<br/>and they calmed down and made up.
Well, what drink finally did the trick?
- A beer.<br/>- Of course, beer.
- I love you.<br/>- I love youl
No, no. Not right now.
You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.
See? With a little renovation,<br/>we could restore it to its former...
What was that?
- What was what?<br/>- I think it went under the bed.
Yeah. I don't see anything.
Ted! Ted! What is that?
Oh, my God!
- It's the cock-a-mouse!<br/>- The what?
Cock-a-mouse.<br/>Part cockroach, part mouse.
It used to live in our apartment.<br/>It must've settled here.
And, oh, look! It had babies.
- Good for it!<br/>- Ew.
I give up. You win. Let's go.
Be well, my friends!
Aw, just how we left them.
Morning.
Who wants breakfast?
You got some coffee<br/>so I can throw it in this traitor's face?
Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey!
Do you guys have some pancakes, because l...
would really like some pancakes.
They're fantastic. Let's be honest.<br/>I love them. But I hate this guy!
I thought they made up last night.
Damn it. I know what happened.
- I love you.<br/>- I love youl
No, no. Not right now.
- Carl, a round of champagne.<br/>- Ooh!
- The champagne!<br/>- We gave them one drink too many.
They must have blacked out<br/>and forgotten the whole thing.
What kind of dirtbag<br/>doesn't stand by his best friends...
but instead sides<br/>with some self-righteous bitch...
with a pointless cause and a megaphone?
Dude, that's my girlfriend.
And you know what?
- I'm on her side now too.<br/>- Whoa. Whoa.
You have got to be kidding me! Ted!
Okay, what drink can fix this?
Mama's done with this drama. What drink can<br/>fix the headache these clowns are giving me?
I got it.
Right?
Time is music the planets make.
What is that?

[<div class="full-script">Kids, this is a story of landmarks.
There are certain moments in<br/>life when you have to decide
which things you can stand<br/>to see torn down,
and which things you have<br/>to preserve, no matter what.
Such a moment came<br/>for all of us
in May of 2011,<br/>at a special meeting of the
New York City Landmarks<br/>Preservation Commission,
where the fate of The Arcadian
would be decided<br/>once and for all.
A symbol of strength<br/>and constancy,
the stone lion of The Arcadian
has watched over<br/>New Yorkers for generations.
So remember:
if the lion head stonework<br/>is regal,
then tearing it down<br/>should be illegal.
Well...
Did you like that?<br/>All right, uh...
We must make sure<br/>the lion is always there.
Destroy The Arcadian?<br/>Oh, no, don't you dare.
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.
Try this one on for size...
If you want New York's history<br/>at your beck and call...
All right, thank you,<br/>Mr. Eriksen.
I just have...
We will now hear from the architect
of the proposed GNB Tower,
Ted Mosby.
Now, uh,
Mr. Mosby, let's just<br/>cut right to the chase.
Do you think The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark?
Okay, it's killing me. What<br/>rhymes with "beck and call?"
Wrecking ball.
Don't go swinging<br/>no wrecking ball.
Ah...
Thank you.

Mr. Mosby,
do you think The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark?
It's not a difficult question.
Actually, it was<br/>a difficult question.
Of course, had he asked me<br/>a few days earlier,
I would have<br/>immediately said...
"Yes. The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark."
And then the crowd<br/>"Oh, my God!
"Did he really<br/>just say that?
"Oh, heavens!
"Oh, my stars!
I must clutch<br/>my pearls!"
So these things are generally<br/>attended by old Southern ladies?
Almost exclusively.<br/>But here's my point:
If they ask GNB's chief<br/>architect-- aka me--
if The Arcadian should be a<br/>landmark, and I say "yes"?
That, no, that wasn't The<br/>Arcadian being destroyed;
that was GNB's hopes of<br/>destroying The Arcadian.
I'm sorry, I should<br/>have been more clear.
Yeah.
The Arcadian's gonna<br/>be all like...
Nice.
I have a message from Barney.
Things between Barney
and the rest of us<br/>had gotten a little frosty.
First this happened.
Meet the new lawyer I hired<br/>to help save The Arcadian.
And then this happened.
What kind of dirtbag
doesn't stand by his best<br/>friends, but instead,
sides with some<br/>self-righteous bitch
with a pointless cause<br/>and a megaphone?!
Dude!<br/>That's my girlfriend.
And ya know what?
I'm on her side now, too.
Which led to this happening.
Message from Barney?<br/>That's my cue to leave.
Good night, guys.
- I love you.<br/>- Mmm. Love you, too.
Good night.<br/>Good night.
All right,<br/>what's the message?
'Cause if it's another<br/>hypothetical
yet eerily accurate<br/>drawing of my boobs ( . ) ( . )
Yeah, I have that, too.
Damn it.
All right, here's the message.
"Oh, hey, guys.<br/>Didn't see you there.
"I was too busy<br/>feelin' fine and..."
Really?
"Feelin' fine<br/>and gettin' some 'jine."
"You may have<br/>noticed the giant plate
"of hot wings in front of me.
"I know how much<br/>you love hot wings.
"Too bad someone<br/>bribed the kitchen
"to take them<br/>off the menu tonight.
"So, if you want some,
"you're going to have<br/>to come back to GNB.
"But hurry, this offer
will be gone lickety-split."
"Do evil laugh."
Oh, um...
So, what are you turds up to?
Oh, we've got the big<br/>LPC meeting in two days.
I have my whole<br/>presentation worked out.
I just need to find a<br/>good rhyme to end on.
Why does it need to rhyme?
Mm.
If you end an argument<br/>with a rhyme,
it's convincing all the time.<br/>Yeah.
It's why in<br/>our apartment:
If you're a-hopin'<br/>to score,
don't leave your socks<br/>on the floor.
And she hasn't since.<br/>No.
Okay, okay.<br/>A couple of things.
Lily, how'd I do?<br/>Nailed it.
Secondly, Ted,
I'm sorry I said<br/>mean things about Zoey.
Are you really going to walk<br/>away from this project
just because you're mad at me?
It's not because<br/>I'm mad at you.
Barney, The Arcadian<br/>was designed
by a guy named<br/>John Clifford Larrabee.
And even though he's been dead<br/>for half a century,
it's my duty,<br/>architect to architect,
to keep his work alive.
Please tell me a little<br/>part of you understands.
I understand.
Zoey has magic lady bits.<br/>What?
Zoey's lady bits...
are magic, and that's<br/>how she controls your mind.
You see,<br/>every few hundred millennia,
lady bits leap forward...<br/>I know
you're only just<br/>getting started,
but this is<br/>already gross.
I once knew such a girl.
It was last call.
In this very bar.
What...?!
No...
What?!
No...
What?!
Um...
thank you for, um, not using<br/>a first name in that story.
Barney, this is<br/>about the building.
Come on. This is so<br/>about the girl.
Okay, fine.<br/>It's about the girl!
I am doing this for Zoey!
I'm in love with her.
Look, I know it's early,<br/>but there's a very good chance
Zoey might be the mother<br/>of my children.
So, in addition to doing this<br/>for John Clifford Larrabee,
I'm also doing this<br/>for Luke and Leia.
Wait. She's gonna let you<br/>name your kids Luke and Leia?
Not if I knock down her favorite<br/>building, she isn't.
Barney, I'm sorry.
Oh, you're not sorry now,<br/>Ted Mosby.
But you will be.
You... will... be.
That's how you do an evil laugh.
Ciao for now.
Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs,
Barney and Marshall's<br/>old boss at GNB?
Well, Arthur was going through<br/>a divorce and taking it
kind of hard.<br/>Hi, Arthur.
Everything okay?
No, everything's not okay.
My stupid wife got<br/>custody of Tugboat.
God, I should have<br/>kept her hidden
in a cage in the basement.
Isn't that animal cruelty?
I'm talking about my wife.
Oh. That's fine, then.
So listen, you know Ted,<br/>the architect?
Yeah, I know your friend Ted.<br/>So,
if Ted stood up at<br/>that big meeting tomorrow
and said that he thought The<br/>Arcadian should be a landmark...
you wouldn't just fire him,<br/>would you?
Right?
You wouldn't just...
You wouldn't just... yeah...
No, Barney.<br/>I wouldn't just fire him.
I'd also fire you.
Come again for Big Fudge?
Can you believe that?!<br/>I can't be unemployed, Robin!
My job is my identity;<br/>It's who I am.
It gives me<br/>the confidence I need
to convince girls<br/>I'm a fighter pilot.
I-I don't understand.
Why would he fire you?
I don't understand.
Why would you fire me?
Have you already forgotten<br/>how Mosby got that job?
By being<br/>the best architect available?
No.
By... being Latino?
No. Let me refresh your memory.
We were in this very room.
Guys, I'm telling you,
if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic,<br/>fire me.
Damn it!
I was kidding?
I'm not kidding!
Oh, by the way, Arthur,
uh, how are things<br/>with you and your wife?
Really good.
In fact, I just put<br/>all my assets in her name.
Smartest thing I've ever done.
Damn it!<br/>No,
you'd better make sure Mosby<br/>doesn't screw up tomorrow.
Because either<br/>that building is going down,
or you're going down.
They're going
to fire him? That sucks.<br/>He loves that job.
And he's been doing it<br/>for years.
Okay, what does Barney<br/>do at GNB?
No idea.<br/>He has a lot of keys.
Okay, Ted, can you just please<br/>think about this before you...
There's nothing to think about.
I-I can't lose Zoey.
That's the only thing<br/>that matters to me right now.
Okay, Ted...
you know I love Zoey.
But, look, sometimes...
I go play chess in the park.
And the key to chess...
Okay, I play online.
But the key to chess...<br/>Okay, it's Angry Birds!
But the key to Angry Birds
is to always try to see<br/>every possible outcome.
And to... hit some pigs<br/>with rocks or something.
I don't know; I don't play.<br/>I can't get it to download.
The point is,<br/>this thing with you and Zoey?
I can see it going<br/>three possible ways.
There's the first scenario.
The chairman asks you...
Do you think The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark?
You say...<br/>No.
And Zoey dumps you on the spot.
We're done here.
There's the second scenario.
The chairman asks you...
Do you think The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark?
You say...<br/>Yes
And you're happy<br/>for, like, a second,
until you realize the building<br/>you helped save
has just become a monument
to everything<br/>this woman made you give up,
and you resent her for it,
so much so, in fact,<br/>that you dump her.
We're done here.
You said there was<br/>a third scenario.
Right.
The chairman asks you...
Do you think The Arcadian<br/>should be a landmark?
But before you can answer...
You're hit in the neck with<br/>a blow dart fired by the ninja
Zoey's ex-husband hired<br/>to assassinate you.
That one's less likely.
What I'm saying...
what I hate saying...
is this.
You and Zoey are gonna break up.
But you can still<br/>save your career
and Barney's.
Okay, first of all,
no ninja's getting a jump on me.
I have the reflexes<br/>of a jungle...
Tree?
Second of all,
I don't care that the odds<br/>are stacked against us.
I'd rather try<br/>to make this work with Zoey
than spend the rest of my life<br/>alone playing Angry Birds,
which, by the way, I've shown<br/>you how to download,
like, 20 times.<br/>I've got to say,
I'm with Ted on this.
Thank you.<br/>I mean, yes,
this is a huge,<br/>divisive issue for them.
Which means<br/>no matter what happens,
there's gonna be<br/>a lot of resentment.
Probably lasting
for years...
infecting every single moment of<br/>the rest of their relationship.
So, in conclusion,<br/>I'm with Robin on this.
Thank you.
That night,
as I slept soundly...
Barney, what are you doing?
Who is this Barney?
My name is<br/>John Clifford Larrabee,
architect of The Arcadian.
And I am
visiting you
in a dream...
Really? 'Cause it feels<br/>more like my insane friend
renting a costume<br/>and breaking into my apartment
in the middle of the night
for what I wish<br/>I could say was the first time.
Look, it's a dream, it is.
So just... okay?
Theodore...
heed my words:
do not try to save<br/>The Arcadian.
Barney, there's condoms<br/>in the drawer.
Just take them and get out.
I am not
Barney...
Whoa! Lighting change!
Theodore, you know The Arcadian<br/>is a badly built,
architecturally unimportant<br/>rat's nest
designed by an overpaid,<br/>plagiarizing ether addict
with two thumbs.
This guy.
Okay, yes,<br/>it's-it's a terrible building,
but... does that mean<br/>we have to knock it down?
I mean, it's<br/>not bothering anyone.
Just anyone who lives in it.
Or looks at it.
Or smells it.
New York is never finished,<br/>Theodore.
She's a lady
only a handful of architects<br/>ever get to dance with.
Do not miss
your turn.
The Arcadian has to go,<br/>doesn't it?
Indeed.
You realize this kind of<br/>screws up my personal life.
Mo' buildings, mo' problems.
This is a dream, right?
Because, Barney, I swear to God,<br/>if that's you...
Mommy's got<br/>Magic Lady Bits, Ted.
Dream! Dream!
It was just a dream.
? ?
Hey. I know it's late,<br/>but, uh...
you want to meet up?
Hello, Mr. Lion.
"Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair""
Hey, I met you right...
...here.
Right. And I mistook you
for a prostitute right...
here.
As far as you know,<br/>I still could be one.
Ah.<br/>And you,
my good man, have<br/>run up quite a tab.
Worth every penny.
All right...
this was fun.
I'm gonna take this cab.
Big day tomorrow.
We need to get some sleep.
And yet...
No, we should get some sleep.
But this was fun.
Yeah.
It's nice getting one last look
to remember what<br/>we're trying to save.
Exactly.
You okay?
Yeah. Good night.
Mr. Mosby, I'm going<br/>to ask you one last time.
Should The Arcadian<br/>be a landmark?
No, it shouldn't be a landmark.
There are a lot
of important buildings<br/>in New York.
The Arcadian isn't one of them.
E-Excuse me,
I have a question for Mr. Mosby.
If he doesn't think
The Arcadian's worth saving,<br/>then whose voice is this?
TED<br/>The Arcadian should be a landmark.
It should.
The lion head stonework<br/>is iconic.
I hate working for GNB.
They're a bunch of...
wieners and gonads.
Oh, heavens!
My stars!
Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?
Yeah, that's me.
This is a nightmare.<br/>I can't believe
she kept that tape.
The LPC's gonna
come back with a decision<br/>tomorrow,
and based on today...
They're gonna landmark<br/>the hell out of that place.
Yeah. We'll end up<br/>out of a job,
all thanks to some stupid,<br/>only sort of awesome lion head.
Better get used<br/>to that lion head.
As of tomorrow, it's gonna be<br/>there till the end of times.
And all because<br/>of my sweet, sweet rhymes.
What are we gonna do?
We should buy a bar.<br/>We should totally buy a bar!
We should absolutely<br/>totally buy a bar!
It's really the only<br/>sensible idea right now.
Oh, oh, and ready?
It's a theme bar.
Mm!
It's a courtroom.
Yes!<br/>Ah!
Where the bartenders<br/>wear sexy judges' robes.
I'll allow it!
The only court where you<br/>show up, then get served.
Ho!
You're judged by a jury<br/>of your beers.
That's not bad.
Just stop it!
No one's buying a bar.
Right now we have<br/>a little problem.
Let's just think<br/>of a solution.
Lily, it's over.
The good guys lost.
I don't know, homegirl<br/>is pretty diabolical.
If there is a plan<br/>that'll get us out of this,
it's somewhere<br/>inside this butter churn.
She'll think of it.
I'm just gonna sit here...
and watch it happen.
And she's got it!
Lily, what's the plan?
Oh, this ought to be good.
And then Lily told us her plan.
Oh, this is good!
We have to find<br/>Arthur right now.
What is so difficult<br/>about this?!
Tugboat figured this out<br/>in, like, five minutes.
This is bush league!
Hey, Arthur!
Oh, cute dog!
No! Tugboat, my other dog,<br/>that was a cute dog.
This little disappointment is<br/>nothing but a cheap facsimile.
I said it!
Yeah, my love is<br/>reserved for dogs
that go to the bathroom<br/>on command
instead of wasting my time!
Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife
has an idea for how we can<br/>save not saving The Arcadian.
Oh, his wife has an idea.
Let me tell you<br/>about wives, okay?
They leave you and take<br/>your best friend with them.
You're not Tugboat!
You'll never be Tugboat!
Uh...
Hey, Arthur?
I guess this one's<br/>kind of cute or whatever.
So... so what's the idea?
Okay, first hear<br/>my demands. One,
Ted and Barney<br/>keep their jobs.
Two, when you guys do finally<br/>blow up The Arcadian,
one of them gets<br/>to push the button.
Dibs.<br/>Dibs.
Fine! What's the idea?
Well...<br/>Kids, for legal reasons,
I have to skip<br/>this part of the story
and jump ahead<br/>to the next night,
as the Landmarks<br/>Preservation Commission
gave their verdict.
Last night,
this committee took a vote,
and while we have all felt<br/>from the very beginning that
The Arcadian is,
well, an eyesore...
Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony
about the lion's head<br/>stonework
left us no choice<br/>but to declare it...
a landmark.
But then, something else<br/>happened last night.
That same lion's head
stonework...
...disappeared.
So...
that makes our job<br/>a little easier.
Motion denied.
Zoey...
Zoey!
All right, what do you have<br/>to say for yourself?
I don't know.
Sometimes... things<br/>have to fall apart
to make way for better things.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the spring of 2011,<br/>Zoey and I broke up.
But the good news...
Goliath National Bank was finally ready<br/>to demolish The Arcadian
and build the new headquarters<br/>I'd designed for them.
The only problem was<br/>I kept butting heads
with my project supervisor<br/>on one very important issue.
I want to press the button<br/>to blow up The Arcadian!
- I want to press it!<br/>- No, I want!
I want to press it!
I dated you both and neither of you<br/>is good at pressing
or even finding the button.
After some awkward pawing around,<br/>that building
is going to fake an implosion,<br/>say, "Baby, that was great",
and go to sleep.
She means you.
I want to press it.
I'm gonna press it!
It's just a button, okay?
Can we just talk<br/>about something else, please?
I ran into Zoey yesterday.
That's the first time<br/>since the breakup.
How's she doing?
I'm still unemployed,<br/>so I had to get a couple roommates.
Saving money.
Making new friends.<br/>No downside.
They're all 22 and sell drugs.
Which means they're not taking them.
So, that's a win.
I can tell you're really busy<br/>so I should...
I'll let you go.
You want to get coffee sometime?
You know "coffee" is code<br/>for "I want to get back together"?
At first I wasn't sure, but then,<br/>she said something that got me thinking.
I want to get back together.
Don't worry, we're not.
I just, I feel bad Zoey's<br/>having such a hard time.
You know what might<br/>make you feel better, buddy?
- I'm not letting you press the button.<br/>- I want to press it!
Sadly, that's all you need<br/>to know about my summer.
Around this time, Uncle Marshall was<br/>still having a tough time finding a job.
He's out printing out a whole<br/>new batch of r?sum?s
because he misspelled the phrase<br/>"detail-oriented."
And when he gets back home,
he is going to find his favorite soup<br/>there waiting for him.
That's sweet, Lily,
but didn't you guys get<br/>food poisoning here one time?
Three times.
But they're really nice about it.
Their policy is,<br/>"Get sick, get a free gallon of soup".
And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's<br/>surprise soup and headed back to work
to introduce the new class pet.
This is Mr. Buttons 2.
Now, after what happened<br/>to Mr. Buttons 1,
we have to be very gentle with...
Don't eat the soup!
Thank God.
This was about to be my third bowl.
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?

Mr. Architect,<br/>big day for you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, getting to stand next to me<br/>while I press the button.
That is going to be legend...<br/>wait for it...
dary adjacent.
Legendary adjacent!
You okay?
This morning I was talking<br/>to the foreman.
Hey, hotshot.
You know, Rod,<br/>I'm loving that nickname,
and I can tell<br/>it's totally affectionate,
but I'd prefer Ted.
Yeah, but you're such a hotshot,
I figured I'd just call you hotshot.
Pick one.
And make sure you like it.
There's going to be 50,000 of these
in your big, hotshot building,<br/>hotshot.
50,000 lightbulbs!
What if this one's too bright?
What if this one flickers<br/>and gives everyone a weird headache?
Do you know how many people<br/>it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?
Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes?<br/>What are we dealing with here?
There's so many decisions to be made.
What if I make all the wrong ones<br/>and my building just sucks?
Not possible.<br/>Your building is new.
And I have one rule.
New is always better.
You can't keep saying you have one rule<br/>if they're always different.
But "new is always better"<br/>is my oldest rule,
which makes it the best.
Everything okay?
Lily got food poisoning<br/>from some soup.
And then I ate the soup,<br/>exactly three hours later.
Which means I can see exactly<br/>three hours into my future,
and it doesn't...
look...
good.
I tried to be supportive.
Oh, baby,<br/>can you just hold me, please?
Of course, baby.
But when Lily gets going
she sounds like a velociraptor<br/>from Jurassic Park.
But then I realized...
a man can do a lot of living<br/>in three hours.
So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful,<br/>crazy dance called life.
My last meal.<br/>MacClaren's famous jalape?o poppers.
My doctor says<br/>I need to eat healthier,
so I figured the round-trip flight<br/>these babies are about to take
will land them permanently<br/>on the no-fry list.
Good-bye, my friend.
It's been a hell of a ride.
I have to...
Hey, babe.
The gang says feel better.
Thanks.
Wait!
You didn't tell them<br/>I had food poisoning, did you?
Marshall, when it's stomach stuff,<br/>you just say "under the weather",
or people start picturing you<br/>doing unspeakable things.
I know.
I just said<br/>that you had the sniffles.
No one is picturing anything
but little red-nosed you
under a blankie with some hot tea.
I wonder what end<br/>it's coming out of Lily right now.
I bet it's her tushie.
I bet it's both.
Speaking of explosions...
Enough already, Ted!<br/>That button's mine!
Yeah, fine, okay.
I got you this job, so I...<br/>Say what?
Whatever.
It's yours.
I gotta run.
Yes.
It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates.<br/>They want me to come interview.
I know it's risky to go,
but this is the best environmental<br/>law firm in New York, my dream job.
Great idea, babe.<br/>I'll ask them.
Is it at all possible,<br/>could I come in on Monday?
Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00.<br/>Thank you.
I love and believe in you too, baby.
Why would Ted
just give up the button like that?
He forgot his phone.
"See you in an hour."
- Who's that from?<br/>- Zoey.
They're meeting for coffee.
Ted's getting back together with her!
Why would Ted get back together<br/>with Zoey? He's doing great.
After a breakup,<br/>we all think we're doing great.
Sometimes the tiniest trigger<br/>can unravel you
and send you crawling right back.
Ted isn't getting back with Zoey<br/>because of lightbulbs.
Ted's gone back for less.
Hi, Natalie.
You want to get coffee sometime?
CARTON
Bro.
Ted, I only have one rule.
But I can't reach the worst part.
Hi, Karen.
Want to get coffee sometime?
CARTON
Coming up next, our two local pandas,
Ming Ming and Bao Bao,<br/>are expecting a baby.
You want to get coffee sometime...?
Get it together, bro.
According to my calculations,<br/>at 6:00 PM,
my body is gonna pay out
like the most disgusting<br/>slot machine in the world.
That gives me two hours<br/>to go do the interview
and still get back in time.
What if you hit the jackpot early?
Don't worry.
I'll be prepared.
I'm talking your ear off, sorry.
Is there anything<br/>I can do for you, sweetie?
Can... I... borrow...
an adult diaper?
Let's stop Ted.<br/>Where are they meeting?
Zoey wrote, "Meet me<br/>at 6:00, where it all began,
where you gave me the orchid<br/>at the intersection."
That's good.<br/>All we have to do is think back
to the time Ted told us<br/>about his first date with Zoey.
Amazing first date with Zoey!
We met at the intersection.
That's sweet.
You weren't listening either?
I was in a coma.
I mean, who pays attention<br/>to that sappy romantic crap?
Yeah, I wasn't listening, either.
Ted really can go on about a bitch.
Great.
He could be anywhere.<br/>We're flat out of clues.
Wait. Ted left a message.
I could hear it<br/>'cause I was in the bathroom...
blowing my nose.<br/>I have the sniffles.
Hey, Lily,<br/>hope you're feeling better.
Marshall told us you're exploding from<br/>both ends like a busted fire hydrant.
Damn it.
Anyway, listen, I was going<br/>to get back together with Zoey today,
but I came to my senses<br/>on the way out here, so...
False alarm.
Oh, crap.
Just stepped in some gum.
I'm getting back together with Zoey!
We're never gonna find him.
Wait.
That's was a subway announcement<br/>in the background.
I speak conductor.
Got it.<br/>Ted's at...
- Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.<br/>- That's the intersection.
That's in Brooklyn. How are we<br/>ever gonna get there in time?
Way ahead of ya.
Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.
I'm sorry about the stench.
We're suing a factory<br/>that's been dumping raw sewage
into a marshland.
Ten minutes ago,
I was knee-deep<br/>in liquefied human feces.
And that was just on the F train.
I can't believe Ted's getting<br/>back together with Zoey.
- They're a total train wreck.<br/>- Unmitigated disaster.
Worst couple ever.
Yeah, almost as bad as us.
We were a mess.
Do you remember how awful<br/>I looked by the end?
My hair was falling out,
my skin was gray,<br/>my back was hunched.
What about me?<br/>I got so fat,
at the end of a date,<br/>you'd unhook my bra.
You were the only boyfriend<br/>I ever motorboated.
Thank God we're not sentimental saps<br/>who panic and get back together.
Seriously,
why would people do that?
I guess I get it.
What do you mean?
Well, no matter how bad things got...
Ted really did love Zoey<br/>for a minute there.
Didn't he?
He did.
She loved him, too.
Didn't she?
Yeah, she did.
Smith and Ninth Street.
Let me show you some of the<br/>gut-wrenching environmental atrocities
that we were working to stop, okay?
Here, pop quiz.
What is that?
That's a seal.
A bloated seal corpse<br/>rotting in industrial waste.
Now, wait till you see what we found
when we cut him open.
- Okay, where the hell are they?<br/>- Maybe this isn't the intersection.
Maybe it is and we're too late. Man,<br/>I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.
I know, right?
Ever since the Trader Joe's<br/>opened up,
Brooklyn is so... whatever.
Wait. Where'd you get that?
Across the street
at the Intersection.
So...
You guys...
wanna buy some weed or...?
She's alone! There's still time!<br/>But where the hell is Ted?
Wait a minute. On their first date,<br/>he brought her an orchid.
How much do you want to bet<br/>he's gonna do it again?
Brilliant. But wait,<br/>he had a huge head start on us.
No way he's still in there unless<br/>he spent an hour choosing an orchid.
Thanks, Julia!
You know what?
Let me see<br/>the pink lady slipper again.
Now, do you know what that is?
A pile of rotting seagull carcasses
covered in toxic sludge.
Being eaten by rats. Exactly.
Now this next slide...
I'm sorry.<br/>That's my wife's water birth.
I don't know how that got in there.
Anyway, that's all my questions.
Oh, my God, I made it!
Now just shake his hand,
clench your very soul<br/>and run like hell!
I like to take 20 minutes at the end<br/>of every interview for your questions.
So don't hold back.
Whatever you got inside there,<br/>you just let her rip.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm just gonna tell him the truth.
When it's stomach stuff,<br/>you just say "Under the weather"
or people start picturing you<br/>doing unspeakable things.
I have food poisoning<br/>and I'm about to start volcanoing
toxic sludge out of both ends!
Nailed it.
Thanks, Julia!
No, on second thought.
- Come on.<br/>- What the hell?!
You can't get back with Zoey<br/>over a lightbulb.
I'm not freaking out<br/>over a lightbulb!
I'm freaking out over<br/>50,000 lightbulbs!
I can't do this!
I only got this job because<br/>you gave it to me, Barney.
I didn't earn it!
The future is scary.
But you can't just run back to the past<br/>because it's familiar.
Yes, it's tempting.
But...
It's a mistake.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Can you give this to the blonde<br/>sitting alone in there
and tell her Ted's really sorry?
Also...
Indirect sunlight. Don't overwater.<br/>Half a cup a week is more than enough.
And kids...
that's how I met your mother.
Psych. It was just some chick.
Hey, baby, how'd it go?
Lily, this year,
this nasty schoolyard bully of a year
will not stop punching me<br/>in the face.
How did we kick off 2011?
My dad died.
And now after five months<br/>of unemployment,
I just blew my dream job.
The good news is, in a few seconds,<br/>I'm gonna start heaving my guts out
because that's what life is<br/>for me now,
just losing what's inside<br/>until I'm just empty.
Baby, come here.
I just want to shut my eyes<br/>for a few seconds before it starts.
And Marshall slept...
... all night.
Who's gonna do the honors?
He is.
You sure?
You earned it.
All clear!
New is always better, right?
Always.
Ten,
nine, eight...
It's a miracle.<br/>I didn't get sick.
I didn't get sick.
I know, baby.
I'm pregnant.
I'm proud of you<br/>for giving Ted the button.
It meant a lot.
It's just a button.
Can we talk about<br/>something else, please?
How you been?
Fine.
I don't know why you would possibly<br/>say yes to this, but,
would you want to grab<br/>a cup of coffee with me sometime?
20 minutes.<br/>I was such a jerk to you.
You can spend the entire time calling<br/>me every dirty name in the book.
I speak four languages.<br/>I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.
I'll call you.
You look beautiful, by the way.
And here I thought<br/>it was too late for sundresses.
It's never too late, Barney.
Challenge accepted.
Best man?<br/>You're being summoned.
Geez, what now?
I heard the groom needed me.
What do you think of this tie?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, if there's one<br/>big theme to this story--
and I swear,<br/>we're totally, almost,
not really all that close<br/>to the end-- it's timing.
Timing is everything.
For example, I never<br/>would met your mother
if it weren't for a wedding.
The last wedding<br/>I ever thought I'd be at.
What do you think of this tie?
Oh, thank God.
Barney Stinson needs you<br/>right before his wedding,
you assume there's at least<br/>one dead hooker in the closet,
right?
Is this one better?
Look, the tie is great, and,<br/>you know, it's perfectly normal
to have some<br/>pre-wedding jitters.
I'm not having jitters.
It just occurs to me
that once I put this tie on,<br/>I can never take it off.
I have to wear this tie<br/>forever and ever.
And sure, this tie's skinny now,
but what happens if it gets fat<br/>and starts bossing me around?
Did I make a mistake?
Would I have been happier<br/>with the other tie?
Ted, can I tell you<br/>a big secret?
Yeah, of course.
I'm not really talking<br/>about the tie.
No, I got that, Barney.
I wonder if this whole<br/>thing's a disaster.
What if this is<br/>the worst wedding ever?
Not possible.
We've already been<br/>to the worst wedding ever.
Punchy's wedding.
Marshall really took<br/>a two flusher on that one.
The story of how<br/>Uncle Marshall ruined
my friend Punchy's wedding
starts in September, 2011.
Punchy had asked me<br/>to be his best man.
Hey.<br/>Hey.
Guys, before we go,<br/>would you mind
reading my wedding toast?
Oh, yeah, no problem.<br/>Sure.
Um, all right,<br/>if I have to.
All right.<br/>Whoa.
There's a few<br/>different versions.
Ted, why are you working<br/>so hard on this toast?
Punchy belched his proposal
through a karaoke mic<br/>at a bowling alley.
Okay, look, I've never<br/>told you guys this,
but over the years, a few<br/>of my old high school buddies
have asked me<br/>to give wedding toasts,
and they haven't gone great.
Somehow those weddings<br/>all fell smack-dab
in the worst moments<br/>of my life.
Joel and Mora's love<br/>is a beautiful thing.
I thought I had that...
till my fianc?e left me<br/>at the altar last week.
I was asked not to talk<br/>about this, so I won't.
I sit outside her house<br/>at night sometimes.
She got a haircut.
After I lost my job last week,
uh, I was asked not<br/>to give this toast...
No, no, no!
The happy couple<br/>needs to hear this.
Things end.
But from the ashes of your<br/>statistically probable divorce,
hope can rise anew.
That is why I'm starting<br/>my own architecture firm--
Mosbius Designs.
Mosbius Designs has failed.
But Alex and Jessica's love<br/>reminds us that...
Oh, God!
Classic Schmosby.
Whoa. Punchy posted the low<br/>points of your life online?
Oh, not just that.
? Mosbius Designs has failed ?
? But Alex and Jessica's love<br/>reminds us that... ?
? Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha... ?
Oh, God!
So now I seem like<br/>a total train wreck
to all my old<br/>high school friends.
And a bunch of people<br/>in Finland.
The auto-tune thing got<br/>kind of big over there.
That's why I have<br/>to nail this toast.
Ted, you want to nail<br/>something at this wedding--
lose the Trapper Keeper.
The only thing you need<br/>to bring to Cleveland
is this.
That fall I became
the youngest architect<br/>in the history of New York
to break ground<br/>on a skyscraper.
Which led to a glowing<br/>magazine feature.
I planned on having it framed--
Uncle Barney had<br/>different plans.
Here's your toast--
"Single file, ladies.<br/>No fatties""
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, you're right.<br/>It's Cleveland.
"Single file, ladies""
I'm not going<br/>to Punchy's wedding
to brag about a magazine...
cover.
Barney, he doesn't need<br/>dating advice from you.
You never even called Nora.
Kids, you remember Nora.
But just the other day...
I'll call you.<br/>It's never too late, Barney.
Or did you call her?
Not that I care.<br/>Did you?
I don't care. Did you?
I haven't called her.
Buddy.<br/>Damn it, Barney.
I was really, really, really<br/>rooting for you two.
Who wants hot wings?
I'm in.
Or maybe we should just pour<br/>hot sauce on Barney,
since he's a total chicken.
I did not chicken out.
Nora is looking for<br/>something serious.
I'm not. End of story.
And yes, Robin, I would<br/>love some wings.
Cannibal.
Okay, next round's on me.
Oh, no, we got it.<br/>No, no...
Now Lily and Marshall<br/>had just found out
they were having a baby.
I can't wait to tell everyone.<br/>Baby, no,
we can't tell anyone.<br/>Not until three months.
I don't want to jinx it.
That's a bit superstitious,<br/>don't you think?
Whenever we board a flight,<br/>you lick the plane.
Have we crashed<br/>even once?
Don't say a word until we<br/>know everything's okay. Deal?
Deal. But everything's<br/>just going to be great.
I promise.
How can you guarantee that?
Come here.
I'm just so happy.<br/>I don't know how
we're going to keep this secret<br/>for three months.
Relax. It'll be easy.
What'll you have?
Four beers, plus<br/>one non-alcoholic.
You're pregnant!<br/>Get in here!
And so we all headed<br/>to my hometown
where we planned to celebrate
Punchy's big day.
Uncle Barney had<br/>different plans.
Get ready, Cleveland.
The last man to<br/>screw you this hard
then disappear<br/>was LeBron James.
You're trying<br/>to get laid here?
What?<br/>God, Barney,
tonight is a magical night
between Ted's annoying<br/>friend and what's-her-face.
Have some respect.
This isn't just getting laid.
This is market research.
You see, my legendary<br/>success rate of 83%...
17-- it's always<br/>the inverse.
...doesn't happen by accident.
Every single play<br/>I run on women
has been<br/>meticulously field-tested.
By weeding out
the bad plays in smaller markets<br/>like Cleveland,
I know which ones will work<br/>in New York.
For example,
tonight marks<br/>the inaugural flight
of the escaped manslaughterer.
Are escaped<br/>manslaughterers sexy?
Not even remotely.<br/>No. No.
Exactly.<br/>We'll never know unless
I try it out tonight.
Schmosby!<br/>Oh!
Turd-faces! What's up?!
You really feel<br/>that ring now.
So glad you all made it.
Open bar. Drink up,<br/>turd-faces,
'cause Kelly's dad's<br/>paying for all this,
and he hates my guts.
It's true.
Who's doing shots?<br/>Come on, let's go.
Oh, no, thank you.
What are you pregnant<br/>or something?
Let's get hammered!
You're drinking<br/>for two tonight, baby.
I will do this for the child.
- Go Browns!<br/>- Go Browns!
In AFC regular season play,
but if they mean the<br/>Super Bowl, go Vikings.
Yowza!
Escaped manslaughterers--<br/>not sexy.
Although in hindsight,
that was kind<br/>of a flawed concept.
Next up, patient zero.
Lily, we are getting<br/>sloshed tonight.
That's all you, baby.
I'll be four shots in<br/>with no food.
In nine months, I'll be pushing<br/>a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby
out of my hoo-ha.
I think Papa can manage<br/>a few extra cocktails.
Well played.
Hakuna Matata!
I, uh, I got<br/>to get some air.
Kids, remember how I told you
Marshall ruined<br/>Punchy's wedding?
That wasn't it.
God, will you look<br/>at that guy.
I wish Barney
were my boyfriend again.
No, thanks.
Wait a minute.<br/>That's your truth voice.
My what?
Whenever you're trying to pass<br/>something off as a joke
but it's actually profoundly<br/>true, you use that voice.
I wish the Spice Girls<br/>would get back together.
They were awesome.
The worst.
That was me.
I totally cut one.
That guy.
Birthday present<br/>from my dad.
All I really want is for him
to tell me that he loves me.
Just kidding.
This pen's enough.
It's not enough.
It's totally enough.
Oh, my God.
You still have<br/>feelings for Barney.
Admit it, you still have<br/>feelings for Barney.
You are drunker than I thought.
I mean,
look at the guy.<br/>Wait, wait, wait.
Before you go, please answer<br/>the following survey
to help me better<br/>bang you in the future.
What didn't work for you<br/>about this play?
Did you A) not believe
I was a Guinness Book<br/>world record holder?
or B) did the fingernails<br/>gross you out?
Th...
I can't wait for<br/>your toast, Schmosby.
Yeah, here come<br/>the waterworks.
Wait. You're rooting for me to<br/>melt down at your own wedding?
Yeah, everyone is.
Plus a few new friends<br/>from Finland.
Hey, good luck, Schmos.
Good luck, good luck.
Take it.
Show them how awesome you are.
Shamelessly plug yourself,<br/>so you can shamelessly plug,
let's say that.<br/>I told you,
I'm not here to brag, okay?
That's it.
You're too polite to brag.
Well, fine.
Let me.
Because the only person<br/>on Earth
who loves Ted Mosby<br/>more than Marshall Eriksen,
is drunk Marshall Eriksen.
So game on.
Kids, remember how I told you
Marshall ruined Punchy<br/>and Kelly's wedding?
That wasn't it either.
Barney and I tried and failed.
That was two years ago.
Why would I ever<br/>go down that road again?
It wouldn't even<br/>make sense.
It doesn't have to make sense.<br/>It's chemistry.
Look, I've always had a sixth<br/>sense about these things.
And now that I'm pregnant...
with this idea<br/>in my mind-uterus,
I see things<br/>even clearer.
You and Barney have the kind<br/>of chemistry
that just doesn't go away.
Really? Then why is he trying<br/>to LeBron anything that moves?
Did this not work for you
because A) vampires<br/>are played out,
or B) claiming that I also<br/>invented Facebook
was kind of a hat on a hat?
You're the reason
he never called Nora.
You're the reason he's only<br/>test-marketing tonight.
And you're the<br/>reason he keeps
striking out on purpose.
Chemistry.
Whoa! Ted!
Is that really you
on the cover of<br/>New York magazine?
Now, you say "yes""
Please stop.<br/>Schmosby.
What's this about a magazine?
You know what, Clay?<br/>It's no big deal.
You know what?<br/>It is a big deal.
Clay, my friend Ted is<br/>designing a skyscraper, Clay.
What have you been<br/>up to, Clay?
Well, I'm still working<br/>at the rental car company...
Bravo, bravo, Clay.
Any major publications<br/>want to write an article
on your sweet<br/>rental car gig?
No, no articles.
My life's pretty dull.
I guess the only news is<br/>this little gal.
Oh, my God,<br/>wook at the wittle baby.
She is so cute.
All I want to do<br/>is put her little feet
in my mouth.
You've created something<br/>truly beautiful.
She is my everything.
I mean, it's kind<br/>of a big deal...
the building,<br/>you know?
Hey, little one.
So, this little angel's<br/>already sleeping
through the night?
I've had some<br/>sleepless nights...
designing this building.
Aw...
Nothing symbolic<br/>about that.
Let it go.
There is no chemistry left<br/>between me and Barney.
We're done.
Oh really? Prove it.<br/>Go tell him.
Why would I go<br/>tell him that?
Because deep down, even if he<br/>isn't aware of it himself,
Barney wants to be with you.
And if it's not<br/>gonna happen,
he deserves to know.
Fine.
Barney, just so everything<br/>is crystal clear...
I know what you're gonna say.
Let's show Cleveland how<br/>it's done.
? The chills that you spill<br/>up my back ?
? Leave me filled<br/>with satisfaction ?
? When we're done, satisfaction<br/>of what's to come ?
? I couldn't ask for another ?<br/>? Uh-huh, uh-huh ?
? Now I couldn't ask<br/>for another ?
? Groove is in the heart ?
? Groove is in the heart ?
? Groove is in the heart ?<br/>? Ask your mama ?
? Groove is in the heart ?
? One, two, three ?
? Groove is in<br/>your heart ?
? Groove is in the heart ?
? Groove is in<br/>the heart ?
? Groove is in the heart ?
? Groove is in the heart. ?
Barney... I...
Sorry.
Oh, my God, it's Nora.
Nora's finally<br/>calling me back.
Wait, you said you<br/>never called her.
I lied. I called her,<br/>like, five times.
Wait, wait!
You of all people<br/>know how much
I suck at these things.<br/>You gotta help me. Please?
Just once I would like
to see what it feels like<br/>to not screw things up.
Yeah, mm-hmm.
Okay.
Hey, Nora.<br/>Thanks for calling me back.
Um, hey, hi.<br/>The-the-the reason that, um,
I called is, uh...
To tell you how<br/>I feel about you.
...to tell you how<br/>I feel about you.
I know we didn't work<br/>out the first time...
I know we didn't work out<br/>the first time...
...and I know it doesn't<br/>make any sense...
...and I know it doesn't<br/>make any sense...
...but I can't shake the feeling<br/>that we belong together.
...but I can't shake<br/>this feeling
that we belong together.
Is there any part of you<br/>that wants to try again?
Is there any part of you<br/>that wants to try again?
Baby, I can't take it anymore.
I've gotta tell somebody<br/>that we're pregnant.
Eriksen, stay strong.
We're keeping this secret.
There's babies everywhere.
It's like a minefield<br/>of cuteness.
Look at this little bastard.
Marshall, stop it.<br/>Stay strong.
You can't let holding some,<br/>some little baby...
oh, with the cute<br/>little cheeks
and the... the little arms
and little legs...
This son of a bitch<br/>has knee dimples.
Let's go tell everyone<br/>I'm pregnant.
Yeah!
You okay?
Nope. You?
Not excessively.
You want to talk<br/>about it?
Not even a little.
Might make you feel better.
Okay, fine,<br/>I'll make you a deal:
you go first, and then I'll<br/>stick with my thing
about not talking about it.
Okay.
All my friends from high school,
they're here with their wives,<br/>their kids.
Me? My date for the night<br/>is a sticky magazine.
Sounds like high school<br/>all over again.
Sorry, it was right there.
I used to believe in destiny,<br/>you know?
I'd go to the bagel place,<br/>see a pretty girl in line
reading my favorite novel,<br/>whistling the song
that's been stuck in my head<br/>all week and I'd think,
"Wow. Hey, maybe she's<br/>the one."
Now I think, "I just know
"that bitch is gonna take
the last whole-wheat everything<br/>bagel."
You've just been focused<br/>on work.
No, it's more than that.
I've stopped believing.
Not in some depressed,
"I'm gonna cry<br/>during my toast" way.
Not in a way I even noticed<br/>until tonight.
It's just, every day,<br/>I think I believe a little less
and a little less<br/>and a little less.
And that... sucks.
What do I do<br/>about that, Scherbatsky?
You're Ted Mosby.
You start believing again.
In what, destiny?
Chemistry.
If you have chemistry,<br/>you only need one other thing.
What's that?
Timing.
But timing's a bitch.
Hey, we still have<br/>our 40 deal, right?
If we're both still<br/>single at 40...
I'm all yours.<br/>Hmm
Unrelated, do architects make<br/>big money?
Aggressively<br/>medium money.
Damn it.
Schmosby, you're up<br/>in two minutes.
Okay, promise me two things,
one) you start believing again,
and two) don't cry<br/>during the toast, Schmosby.
I promise.
Good.
We're having a baby.
What, for real?
For real.
Oh!<br/>Oh!
Attention, everyone!
It's time for the reason<br/>we're all here tonight.
Schmosby's toast!
We're here tonight<br/>to celebrate love.
Love brings us new life...
Hey!
This isn't a meltdown.
These are tears of joy.
Ted is happy for his friends
'cause he's the best guy<br/>that I know.
And do you know why he's happy?
Because this beautiful lady<br/>right here is pregnant.
How did you know that?!
That was supposed<br/>to be a secret!
Turns out...
Go Browns!
Go Browns!<br/>Whoo!
In AFC regular season play,
but if they mean the<br/>Super Bowl, go Vikings.
How dare you.
That's my daughter,<br/>you piece of garbage.
You're still gonna pay<br/>for all this, right?
"Piece of garbage"?<br/>That's my son.
And that is how Marshall<br/>destroyed Punchy's wedding.
But we didn't care.
There was gonna be a sixth<br/>member of our little family.
No wedding will ever,<br/>ever be as bad
as that one, right?
I picked the right tie,<br/>didn't I?
You nailed it.
And hey, just be glad<br/>it's not the ducky tie.
Ooh, the ducky tie.
That's a good story kids.<br/>I'll get to that.
Man, we are not even close<br/>to the end.
You're a good<br/>best man, Ted.
You're gonna cry during<br/>the toast, aren't you?
Oh, I'm totally gonna cry.
Come in.
Ted, the bride wants to see you.
Okay.
Really? You're gonna go<br/>with that tie?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Oh, God, guys, I'm<br/>still really hungover.
Did I really<br/>ruin a wedding?
No, you didn't ruin<br/>a wedding.
Just the reception.
And the bar mitzvah next door.
And my dress.
And your dress. You put on<br/>a dress at one point.
Okay, you know what,<br/>that's it.
I'm about to be a dad,<br/>and I want to be
the kind of man that my<br/>child can look up to.
So, sweeping declaration--
I am never getting drunk again<br/>as long as I live.
(laughter)<br/>I'm serious.
NARRATOR: Kids, it's not that<br/>your Uncle Marshall
had a drinking problem.
But whenever he made a sweeping<br/>declaration like that,
you pretty much knew...
(slurred):<br/>I did it again.
But I'm getting ahead<br/>of myself.
What happened<br/>to your leg?
Oh, nothing.
I'm meeting Nora<br/>for coffee.
She's still mad at me, so<br/>I need some sympathy points.
She likes musicals,<br/>so I'm going
to tell her I fell off the stage
during a performance<br/>of Man of La Mancha.
What do you think?
Lose the cast.
A one-man show-- I like it!
Just so we're clear--
this woman is mad at you<br/>because you lied to her.
So your solution is to pretend<br/>you broke your leg?
You're right.
A neck brace.<br/>Thanks, Lil.
Man, I wish I'd have talked<br/>to you sooner.
I've been practicing<br/>with these crutches all day
and whoever left them<br/>in my lobby
probably really<br/>needs 'em.
Well, uh, I have<br/>some good news.
As you all know, I recently<br/>decided to get back out there
and start dating again.<br/>And, uh, well...
Is this you?
Uh, yeah. Hi.
I'm Ted.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
That's great, Ted.
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment<br/>of pure destiny.
The kind you just<br/>can't manufacture.
Or so I thought.
Oh, no.<br/>How did I get on there?
Hi. Ted Mosby.
Guilty.
Hi. Ted Mosby.
That is embarrassing.
I should be on the cover of<br/>Egg On My Face magazine.
But I'm not.
I'm on the cover of this one.
Hi. Ted Mosby.
16 moments of pure destiny
in one day,<br/>and of those 16,
ten were single.
Of those ten,<br/>seven liked what they saw.
Of those seven,
four were women.
Of those four,
two gave me their real number.
And I have a date<br/>with both of them.
Okay.<br/>(phone ringing)
Guys,
it's Garrison Cootes.
Kids, Garrison Cootes<br/>was a senior partner
at Honeywell &amp; Cootes.
One of the biggest<br/>environmental law firms
in America.
Marshall would have given<br/>anything to work there.
If I don't get this job,<br/>I might end up working
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.
And nobody wants that.
Or maybe you guys want that,<br/>because you'll get free tacos,
'cause your my peeps.
But right now I need<br/>all of you to calm down!
(phone ringing)
(with British accent):<br/>Hello.
Marshall, this is<br/>Garrison Cootes.
Sorry I didn't get back<br/>to you sooner,
but I've just been swamped.
(laughing)
Which is funny,<br/>'cause I'm literally
standing in a swamp.
(nervous chuckle)
Anyway, I'm just out here,<br/>I'm just collecting some samples
for this pollution case<br/>we're working on.
I love the work you guys do.<br/>That's a croc...
No, I mean it.
No, no, there's a crocodile<br/>about five feet away from me.
So I'm just going to ignore
the hot urine filling<br/>my waders as we speak,
and tell you that<br/>we're very interested.
He's interested.
Obviously we have<br/>to do some sort
of credit check, you know,<br/>a criminal record
and Google search, but as long<br/>as nothing unseemly turns up,
you're good to go, man.
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!
Well, I gotta run.
(laughing)
This is so funny,
because, actually, I physically<br/>have to run now.
- Croc saw you?<br/>- He's advancing, yeah.
♪ How I Met Your Mother 7x02 ♪<br/>The Naked Truth<br/>Original Air Date on September 19, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
NARRATOR: The next night,<br/>Barney met Nora for coffee.
Thankfully, without<br/>the ridiculous leg cast.
Hey, Nora, thanks<br/>for meeting me here.
What happened to your neck?
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.
I was performing in<br/>a one-man show of Fiddler.
There was this roof.
Wow, that one has<br/>fantastic ta-tas.
What, where?
Oh... Oh, damn it.
Ta-ta.
Wait, Nora, wait...<br/>No, look, please don't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What is the matter with you?
What kind of person<br/>needs to lie like that.
A person who really,<br/>really likes you.
And suspects,<br/>probably accurately,
that you're way<br/>out of his league,
and so he feels the need to...
I'm sorry, you were kidding
about the fantastic<br/>ta-tas, right?
'Cause I'm looking around<br/>and I do not see 'em...
(groans)
I just had two<br/>back-to-back dates.
That's right,<br/>two lovely ladies,
four large cappuccinos,<br/>and... one sec.
(toilet flushing)
And I don't know which<br/>date was more awesome.
Let's meet the girls.
TED:<br/>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.
She's traveled<br/>all over the world.
Speaks four languages,<br/>is a concert pianist.
And Claire reached<br/>for the check.
So I don't know.
It's a squeaker.
I mean, both<br/>of these girls
have the potential to be<br/>something really special.
They both move<br/>on to the next round.
Wait a minute.
You're going to date<br/>two girls at once?
Don't you think you should<br/>just choose one
before it gets serious?
Define serious.
Well, that's complicated.
I guess you have to weigh<br/>expectations,
emotional investments...
Third base.
Seriously, third base.
So I can go to second base with<br/>both of these girls, no problem?
Oh, honk away, my friend.<br/>Yeah, honk away.
Oh, no.
NARRATOR: Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned<br/>the background check,
Marshall had been<br/>scouring the Internet.
Most of what he found<br/>was pretty harmless.
In some cases,<br/>really awesome, until...
Not good.
This-- this is not good.
Thanks, Stacy.
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,
thanks to the generous<br/>endowment from--
Oh, ho-ho!
Did somebody say<br/>generous endowment?
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you<br/>can call me Beercules!
(growling and laughing)
Well, that could<br/>be anybody.
Oh, man, I forgot<br/>about Beercules.
Who made this<br/>Web site anyway?
- Pete Durkenson.<br/>- Of course.
Is that the guy who convinced<br/>you to run across campus naked?
I was pledging his frat,
which I gave up on<br/>after three days,
because frats are stupid<br/>and elitist
and also I found out<br/>he wasn't in a frat.
Oh, my God.
This is awesome.
I just got invited<br/>to the Architects' Ball,
the annual gala that honors<br/>the city's greatest architects.
Oh, no, you guys see<br/>why this sucks, right?
Because it's an annual gala
honoring the city's<br/>greatest architects?
Robin, this is the social event<br/>of the year.
You take a girl<br/>to the Architects' Ball,
brother, you're going<br/>to third base.
Whichever girl
I take as my date,
she will be<br/>Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend
by the end of the night.
Okay, no more sitting<br/>on the fence.
Robin, get me my legal pad.
It's pros and cons time!
(cheering)
NARRATOR:<br/>And kids, they really cheered.
Let me make one thing<br/>very clear to you.
I don't date guys who lie to me.
Well, see, I did not<br/>know that.
My bad.
So, from here on in,<br/>no more lies.
I will never lie<br/>to you again.
I'm serious. Ask me anything.
Okay.
Have you ever successfully
gotten a woman in bed<br/>by lying to her?
Have I ever...
If I'm being totally honest...
Yes.
More than once?
More than once...
Wow, that's...
(clicking tongue)
I guess if we're<br/>splitting hairs,
then, technically...<br/>there was a plurality
to the times I've lied to women<br/>for sex having purposes.
What were they?
Nines and tens mostly.
There was a four once.
She was a slump buster.
But, Nora, after that, I had a<br/>run that you would not believe.
Man, honesty feels good.
What were the lies?
You want me to tell you every<br/>lie I've ever told a woman
to get her into bed?
A bed or any other place<br/>you had sex with her.
Oh, you're good.
(chuckles)
Pete, Pete. Hey.
Beercules!
Bring it in, dude.
(exhales heavily) Hey, I've been<br/>trying to call you,
like, all night.
Oh, my God, sorry.
I would have answered,<br/>but it is Tuesday night.
It's Sunday.
And you know what that means.
"Edward Forty Hands."
NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"
is a game that involves taping<br/>two 40-ounce bottles
of malt liquor to your hands.
The object is to finish<br/>both bottle--
Oh, my God, why am<br/>I telling you this?
Let's move on.
Okay, you know that old video<br/>of me streaking?
I watch it every day.
Well, I need you to take it down<br/>off the Internet.
Like, right now.
There are two ways<br/>that can happen.
One, you can give me<br/>$4 million,
or... you can help me<br/>go to the bathroom,
because I... I can't...
Yeah, those are two<br/>non-negotiable no's.
Well, I'm sorry we could not<br/>do business together.
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a game<br/>of "Edward Forty Hands,"
and the competition is fierce.
Who are you<br/>playing with, anyway?
Just myself.
Meanwhile, Barney continued<br/>listing every lie
he'd ever told to get laid.
There's no time to explain<br/>how I got bit there.
I just need someone<br/>to suck the poison out.
The surgeons gave me a new face,
honey.
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?
Me llamo David Beckham.
(with foreign accent): If I were<br/>only casting The White Swan
the role would be yours.
(deep voice):<br/>No, I am a lesbian.
This thing that I'm wearing<br/>is just really lifelike.
Okay, let's skip ahead.
What's the worst one?
The lowest of the low?
The creme de la creepy?
Uh... Oh, I once pulled<br/>The Soul Man.
There was this beautiful girl<br/>who only dated black guys...
Barnell!<br/>Ooh, I knew it!
I can't decide.
They're both awesome.
If only architects had<br/>two balls, right, Ted?
I got this.
Ted, left or right?
Yes, yes, great idea.
Let the fates decide, huh?
I will pick left.
Just call one of 'em.
Ugh!
Ted, deep in your heart,
you know that you<br/>kind of like one
more than the other.
Trust me-- take the other.
Um, maybe I haven't<br/>been clear: this is...
the Architects'<br/>Ball, Robin.
It's a star-studded event.
Okay, name one celebrity<br/>who's gonna be there.
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?
Yeah.<br/>He's there every year.
And that guy's a rock star.
You know, Ted,<br/>I've been thinking--
it's too soon to narrow it down<br/>between these two girls.
Just take a friend.
Like I... I don't know,<br/>maybe, uh, a friend
who had a poster of<br/>Lenny Kravitz on her wall,
and may or may not<br/>have, perhaps,
dated that poster, on and off,<br/>throughout high school.
This pros and cons list<br/>isn't cutting it.
I need a color chart.
ALL (chanting):<br/>Color chart! Color chart!
NARRATOR: And, kids,<br/>we all really chanted.
Pete, please.
I'm unemployed.
I have a huge mortgage.
I have a baby on the way.
And now, I'm about<br/>to lose a job I really need
because of a 15-year-old prank!
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?
Beercules, what happened?
You're like a different person.
The guy in that video<br/>was awesome.
He had potential.
He could have been president of<br/>the frat one day.
There was no frat!
Now he's just a bummer.
It's not like I want<br/>to be a bummer.
I just... I have to be.
I'm gonna be a dad.
You'll have kids someday.
You'll understand.
Dude, I have four kids.
Pete, please take<br/>the video down.
All right, Beercules,<br/>I'll take the video down.
If...
you can best me in<br/>a game of my own choosing.
Oh, no...
And I select the beautiful game,
the sweet science...
Pete, please,<br/>I'm so hungover...
...the sport of kings...
I don't want to play<br/>"Edward Forty Hands."
I was gonna say darts--
but "Edward Forty<br/>Hands" it is!
And that concludes all<br/>the space-related lies.
Let's move on to<br/>the world of sports.
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought<br/>of another space one.
"I've been bitten<br/>by a moon snake.
You need to suck all the<br/>space poison out of my--"
Okay, Barney, uh,
I have to be at work<br/>tomorrow at 8:00,
which means I have<br/>just about enough time
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,<br/>hugging myself.
So this was fun.
Can I call you, or...?
Barney, you're funny, handsome
and really quite clever.
But you're also a sociopath.
Well, I count three pros<br/>and one con, so...
How do you still think<br/>you have a chance with me?
Because you sat<br/>here all night.
You could've left right<br/>away, but you didn't.
Look, Nora, all those lies--<br/>that's the old me.
But I swear to you,<br/>I am trying to change.
You... make me want to change.
How do I know that's not a lie?
I'll prove it.
I will prove how serious I am.
I will not leave this diner
until I get<br/>a second date with you.
Good-bye, Barney.
I'm not kidding.
This is a 24-hour diner.
I'll stay here forever,<br/>if I have to-- and I will!
Just water for me. Thanks.
Okay, so red indicates<br/>level of attractiveness,
blue--<br/>intellectual stimulation,
green-- emotional connection,
yellow-- compatibility<br/>of life goals,
and purple-- whether or not<br/>she reached for the check.
Well, it looks like<br/>Jessica's ahead
in the first<br/>four categories.
(sighs heavily)
Did not reach for the check...
Oh, this?
(wry laugh)
No big deal. This...
This cost three<br/>months rent,
and, uh, I've never<br/>gotten to wear it,
because I bought it for that big<br/>event that you invited me to,
which then fell through.
But, you know what?
Don't feel guilty about that.
What big event?
That thing with your uncle.
His funeral?
It didn't fall through,
he miraculously<br/>came out of a coma.
And I forgive you.
Now, can I please<br/>meet Lenny Kravitz?
(door opening)
(slurred):<br/>I did it again!
Aw, honey.
You got drunk again.
I can't believe<br/>I took the over.
Just to be clear, "I did it<br/>again" is not a reference...
to my current state of<br/>inebriation.
What's it a reference to?
My name is Marshall Eriksen.
(on YouTube):<br/>I'm 33 years old.
And if my potential future<br/>employer, Garrison Cootes,
is watching this...
bow down to Beercules!
(hearty, drunken laughter)
Well, that could<br/>be anybody.
(moans)
(phone vibrating)
Oh, goodness.
(voicemail beeps)<br/>Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.
I'm gonna make this real simple:
You're gonna take down<br/>that video of Marshall.
You know why?
Because I'm friends with three<br/>girls who dated you in college,
and girls<br/>tell each other everything.
Every tiny detail.
Huh. So...
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes<br/>the little wee-wee clock.
Pete's got a little wee-wee?
No idea.<br/>What's everyone getting?
This was bound to<br/>happen eventually.
I've been trying so hard<br/>to suppress, like,
my carefree idiot side,
that it just rebelled<br/>and came out swingin'!
It sure did.
MARSHALL (on video):<br/>Look at me! I'm a windmill!
Who am I kidding?<br/>I'm not ready to be a dad.
I thought that I was,<br/>but it's, like...
my dad never did stuff<br/>like that, you know?
So what if he did?
You'd still love him.
And be honest-- wouldn't you<br/>love to stumble onto a video
of him running down<br/>the street naked, yelling,
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!
I got an icicle on my deal!"
(Barney groans)
Oh! Hey, guys!
Ow! My neck!
Uh... oh! Hey!
Look at that.
Barney, what are<br/>you doing here?
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave<br/>until she gave me a second date,
and I mean it.
I've already been here<br/>nine hours.
I still need<br/>another minute.
I mean... call me crazy, but
I'm gonna stay here until<br/>I get that girl back.
That-- that's<br/>what I want.
The way Barney<br/>feels about Nora--
I want that feeling again.
I don't want to be choosing<br/>between two girls,
I want to be... a complete<br/>head-over-heels idiot for one.
Yeah, the complete<br/>head-over-heels idiot thing's
pretty nice.
It's not bad.
Although, for the record--
sweeping declaration!--
I am never getting<br/>drunk again.
(laughing)
NARRATOR:<br/>And sure enough...
All hail Beercules!
(laughing)
Yeah!
NARRATOR: But, again,<br/>I'm getting ahead of myself.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.
Yes, Mr. Cootes.
Hi. How are you?
I just wanted to let you know,<br/>we did the background check,
and that is<br/>some disturbing streaking.
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...
The rainbow streaking<br/>in this sample
is definitely<br/>from chemical runoff.
Oh, I... (stammers)
Bottom line-- we'd love to have<br/>you on board.
That is fantastic!
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!
Well, you're welcome.
And-- oh, and when<br/>you're at the office,
try to wear some clothes,<br/>okay, Beercules?
(laughing)
Wow! That's a big snake.
Oh, there's<br/>a snake in the swamp?
No, I'm talking about<br/>your penis.
See you tomorrow.
I got the job.
Yay!
And I think that my boss<br/>already sexually harassed me.
But he saw the video<br/>and he doesn't care!
See that? Maybe Beercules<br/>isn't so bad after all.
Yeah.
(phone rings)
Hello?
Hey, Marshall,<br/>my name is Pete Durkenson.
We went to Wesleyan together.
Yeah, no, I know.
Pete, we... we just<br/>hung out yesterday.
All right, now Lily's message<br/>makes a little more sense.
Listen, don't worry, bro,<br/>I'm gonna take down the video.
You know what?
Leave it up.
Whatever you say, Beercules.
Scalpel.
You know what?<br/>This is good.
I want our kid to see<br/>every side of who I am.
Yeah.
Even the side that runs through
the East Village hangin' brain.
I'm gonna call Pete back.
That's a good idea.
NARRATOR: That evening, I took<br/>Robin to the Architects' Ball.
Thanks again for<br/>taking me to this.
Mm. My pleasure.
And, you know, you might<br/>find it interesting.
Some of these guys represent the<br/>living history of New York--
Yeah, yeah.<br/>Where's Lenny Kravitz?
Right there.
Leonard Kravitz,<br/>world-renowned architect.
Guy's a rock star.
He's gonna be<br/>giving his famous
90-minute lecture<br/>on crossbeams.
Well, great.
I'm gonna go find one<br/>and hang myself from it.
Okay.
NARRATOR: Kids, you can't talk<br/>yourself into falling in love.
It doesn't take days<br/>of deliberation.
When it's real,<br/>you know pretty quickly,
and with absolute certainty.
I had forgotten that.
But I was about to be reminded.

Oh, guess who<br/>I ran into.
A girl from my past.
Any guesses?
- Stella.<br/>- Zoe.
- Karen?<br/>- The girl who beat you up.
The girl who ruined<br/>a photo with Slash!
The girl who made you get<br/>the butterfly tattoo?
You make it sound<br/>like I've dated
a series of Stieg Larrson<br/>novels.
Perhaps I need to be<br/>a little more specific.
I met this girl at a wedding.
We were together for a while,<br/>but then she moved to Germany.
We decided to try long<br/>distance, but it didn't work
because I cheated on her with<br/>someone at this very table.
Victoria.
Victoria!
She catered dessert<br/>for the Architects' Ball.
Wow. I mean, what's it been,<br/>like, what, six years?

Okay, can we stop talking about<br/>my wife's breasts, please?
Ted ran into Victoria!
I know, I'm still<br/>a little shaken by it.
I mean, there she was<br/>after all these years.
The emotions and memories and...
Geez, Lily, it's like you have<br/>a butt on your chest.
Whoo-whoo-whoo!
♫
Why on Earth would<br/>I want to see that?
They're round<br/>and attached to my body.
It's an even trade.
Okay, who wants dinner?
Bless you.<br/>Let's go to Shinjitsu.
Aw, again? Really?
You bring that up,<br/>like, once a month.
It's hibachi grilling<br/>with a vaudeville twist.
I mean, come on, who's in?
(Ted, Lily &amp; Robin<br/>murmur approval)
No! Forget it!
Okay, how about this:
if you can go ten seconds<br/>without looking at Lily's boobs,
we'll go wherever<br/>you want to go.
Deal.
Damn it!
Oh, well.
So you saw Victoria.
You must have<br/>been freaked.
No, it was cool.
Hey, Ted.
Hey, kiddo.
Okay, Ted, 'cause from<br/>where I was standing...
Robin! Just... okay?
I'm telling this story.
Instead of the obligatory<br/>awkward small talk,
let me just kick this off
by saying I'm<br/>really, really sorry.
Thanks. It's unnecessary,<br/>but thanks.
So, wasn't awkward.
- It was a little awkward.<br/>- Not really.
It was a little awkward.
Lucky for you, the cavalry rode<br/>in to smooth things over.
So, uh...
I stole your boyfriend!
That was, like, crazy!
Like, what?!
But... bridge, water under it.
It was all Ted's fault.<br/>He got me drunk.
What?<br/>Yeah! Be right there.
Oh, guess who's here? Robin.
Oh. I'm really happy<br/>for you guys.
You look cute together.
Oh, no, no, we're not together.
I mean, we-we dated<br/>for, like, a year.
But now we're just friends.
It's not weird.
No, no. Why would that be weird?
I mean, if you hung out<br/>every day, that would...
We do.
...still not be weird.
I've never<br/>known anybody
that hangs out with their ex<br/>every day.
Well, Barney does.
Really?<br/>Who's Barney's ex-girlfriend?
Robin.
Your Robin?
Mine and Barney's.
You don't all three hang out<br/>together?
All the time.
And we have weird.

Oh, good!<br/>Here we go!
The main event.
Oh, we got Takumi.<br/>He is good!
I mean, who am<br/>I kidding?
They're all amazing!
Let the dinnertainment begin!
Oh, that reminds me,
there's this other restaurant<br/>we should try sometime.
What they do is, they cook<br/>your meal in a little room
called a "kitchen."
What's the name of that...?
Oh, yeah! "Every Other<br/>Restaurant In New York City."
Hashtag burn, hashtag<br/>Your Tie Is Still Dumb,

So you're talking to Victoria.
I'm talking to Victoria.
Well, I should probably<br/>get back to the bakery.
I'm taking a late bus out<br/>to the Hamptons tonight,
and I've got a sink full<br/>of dishes
that my assistant did not clean.
Because my assistant is me.
But it was really good seeing<br/>you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.<br/>- Okay.
Wait.
Let me do the dishes.
What?
Victoria,<br/>do you believe in fate?
I believe you're about<br/>to give a big speech on fate.
Well, I do.
And I think when two people like<br/>you and me randomly bump
into each other,<br/>it means something.
I have to make amends<br/>for what I did.
Look, I can't undo what I did<br/>six years ago, but...
I can wash dishes.
It's actually something<br/>I'm good at.
Ted...
I swear to you<br/>I am not trying anything.
♫ I said, bang, bang,<br/>bangity-bang ♫
♫ I said a bang, bang,<br/>bangity-bang. ♫
Guys, guys! Shut up!
Give the artist<br/>a little respect!
Sir, I apologize for that,
and for what<br/>I'm about to say.
Here's my impression<br/>of this guy.
Uh! Ooh!
Uh! Uh!
Welcome to Shinjitsu! Uh!
I used to be a night manager<br/>at Dairy Queen! Brr!
Anyone can do that.
Oh really? Then why<br/>don't you do it, Barney?
Show us all the tricks<br/>if they're so easy.
Show us the onion volcano,
the fried rice<br/>beating heart,
the shrimp in the pocket.
I bet Ted showed Victoria<br/>the shrimp in his pocket.
Shrimp? Really?
Okay, I'll do all
those things. You just name<br/>the time and the place.
Okay, right here<br/>after we eat.
And what do I get if I do?
What do you want?
I want to touch Lily's boobs.
Deal!
Hey, sweetie?
Yeah, I heard.
Okay, Barney, you want<br/>to make this real?
Let's make this real.
Terms: If you can do<br/>all that stuff
that Marshall just listed off,
I will let<br/>you touch one boob.
Both boobs.
Just one.
Touch and squeeze.
Just touch.
Touch and motorboat.
Just touch.
- Honka honka?<br/>- Barney.
Just touch.<br/>Just touch.
For one hour.<br/>For one second.
20 minutes, both boobs.
Thirty seconds, one boob.
Four minutes, both boobs,<br/>three squeezes.
One minute, both boobs,<br/>one squeeze.
Deal!
But... if you can't do<br/>everything
and I mean everything,
then you have to wear<br/>Marshall's ducky tie...
for one year.
Ooh...
Deal.
So you get to the bakery.
We get to the bakery.
Well, this is great.
You know what else<br/>is getting clean
along with this<br/>cupcake tray?
My conscience.
You got anything else<br/>you need to atone for?
My oven needs cleaning.
Un, no, nothing else.
Not yet anyway.
♫ Bang, bang, bangity-bang,<br/>said a bang-bang-bangity. ♫
I'm getting married.
Bang.
Baby, I think I got yours.<br/>This one has no booze.
Oh, no, that's mine.
Yeah, I don't know
why people think<br/>that Mai Tais need booze.
I've been drinking virgins<br/>all night,
and they're delicious.
Yeah, well, enjoy<br/>your Mai Tai
because as of tomorrow night,<br/>you'll be wearing my tie.
Our future child<br/>is so lucky.
Wait. You're not drunk?
Huh. I guess not.
It's a hustle!
We gettin' hustled!
Oh, this stinks.
This stinks to holy hell!
He's gonna win the bet!
Baby, come on. Even if he was<br/>sober as a nun,
there's no way he could do what<br/>these guys do.
Exactly. I mean, to learn<br/>the trademark secrets
of Shinjitsu hibachi cooking,
one would have to go<br/>all the way...
to Hoboken, New Jersey.
Yeah, they have a school there.
It's a six-month course.<br/>They teach you everything.
How do you know that?
Maybe I looked it up<br/>on my phone just now.
Then again, maybe not.
So Victoria's getting married.
She's getting married.
I'm sorry. I should have<br/>told you that way earlier.
No, no, it's fine.
You thought something<br/>was gonna happen.
Like one percent.
Maybe slap on a ring next time.
Well, the problem is,<br/>he hasn't asked me yet.
I found the ring in a box<br/>in his sock drawer.
Wow! Guy's got a whole drawer<br/>just for socks?
Must be nice.
So when's Money Bags<br/>popping the question?
I'm pretty sure tomorrow.
He's taking me out
to a really nice restaurant out<br/>in the Hamptons.
It's right on the water,
so afterwards we'll take a walk<br/>on the beach in the moonlight.
You should probably go.
I don't know.<br/>It sounds pretty intimate.
I'm serious. I feel<br/>like I misled you.
Madam, I came here<br/>to wash your dishes.
Nothing more.
- Whoa! What was that!?<br/>- What was what?
This guy and Barney<br/>just shared a look!
Do you know him?
They did it again!
This whole thing stinks,<br/>I tells ya!
It stinks!
Lily, are you really suggesting<br/>that Barney spent six months
commuting back and forth<br/>to Hoboken
to learn a signature cooking<br/>style of a restaurant
he doesn't even like<br/>so he could win a bet
he hadn't even made yet?
Yeah, the whole thing stinks.
No, it's not possible, okay?
I was the one who said<br/>let's go to Shinjitsu...
Bless you.
How could Barney have...
You brilliant bastard.
It's all so obvious now.
For the past, oh, I don't<br/>know how long, five years,
every time I've said,<br/>"Let's go to Shinjitsu""
Bless you.
You've sneezed.
Every time.
And little by little...
Let's go to Shinjitsu.
Bless you. Bless you.
...you forged the association<br/>in my brain.
So what should we do for dinner?
Let's go to Shinjitsu.
Oh, bless you.<br/>Thanks.
Until eventually...
Yes, I know I said that<br/>we'd be back Sunday,
but guess what?<br/>We are back now!
Now what on earth...
Stop bouncing!<br/>What on earth
would make you think that<br/>we'd be okay with this?
Let's go to Shinjitsu.
When you were sick<br/>for a week last year,
I had Shinjitsu<br/>like six times.
You had the knife skills...
you had the trigger...
All you needed then was<br/>to want something from me.
And then one day... those<br/>somethings came a-busting out.
Wapowng!
I am gonna have<br/>to walk this earth,
knowing Barney has<br/>touched my boobs.
Yeah. It stays with you.
His email reminders don't help.
Okay, Lily, this is ridiculous.
If you want to<br/>call the bet off...
Great! The bet's off!
Let me finish.
Here's the deal: If<br/>you let me just see them--
no touching, just looking--<br/>for one minute...
30 seconds.<br/>For 30 seconds,
in a well-lit<br/>photography studio...
- In the alley.<br/>- In the alley...
then we'll cancel this<br/>entire wager completely.
Do we have a deal?
I totally think you<br/>should take the deal.
I don't think we have a choice.
Go on, take the deal.
I'll... think about it.
So you're doing the dishes...
I'm doing the dishes.
All done.
Congratulations.
Your karmic slate is<br/>clean and lemony fresh.
- Cheers.<br/>- Cheers.
See, now I can start anew,
and hopefully end up as<br/>happy as you and, uh...
Sorry, what's his name?
- Whose name?<br/>- Your fiancé to-be.
Oh! His name is Klaus.
- Klaus.<br/>- Klaus.
German name.
- Yeah, German guy.<br/>- Hmm.
When you were<br/>living in Germany,
and we were doing the whole<br/>long-distance thing...
wasn't there a Klaus<br/>in your class?
There was a Klaus in my class.
- And you and Klaus were close.<br/>- Not that close.
Yes, yes, you and the Klaus from<br/>your class were quite close.
Kind of close.
- Was that your Klaus?<br/>- My Klaus?
- In your class.<br/>- In my class?
Is your Klaus the kind of<br/>close Klaus from your class?
Yes.
You didn't cheat on me<br/>with Klaus, did you?
- No. No, I did not.<br/>- Mm.
Okay, new question.
After we broke up,<br/>how long were you single
before you and Klaus<br/>started dating?
Oh, how long... um, well,<br/>we broke up in April, so...
a day and a half.
Oh, you have got<br/>to be kidding me!
I'm sorry.
So I've spent the last<br/>six years feeling like
I completely betrayed you,<br/>when in truth, you...
No, you know what?
Okay. Fine.
Just let yourself off the hook<br/>on a technicality!
Forget the fact that<br/>you did cheat on me!
Forget it? I will<br/>never forget it. Okay?
I will never stop regretting it,
because what we had<br/>meant that much to me!
I just... I wish it had meant<br/>something to you, too.
Are you kidding?
- I loved you!<br/>- Did you?
Yes.
We had such an amazing<br/>time together.
Do you remember that night
we found that crazy<br/>videotape of Barney?
Game night.
We played that ridiculous<br/>game Marshall invented.
- Marshgammon.<br/>- Yeah.
We've played it a few times<br/>since. I still don't get it.
Remember the night we met?
I remember you not<br/>letting me kiss you.
Remember why?
You had this ridiculous idea
that the moment leading<br/>up to the kiss...
The drum roll.
...is as good as<br/>the kiss itself.
Isn't it?
Well, it's certainly<br/>more innocent.
It's completely harmless.
Completely.
- Oh, my God!<br/>- Oh no.
No, no-no-no-no-no.
- I should not have done that.<br/>- No, that was me.
I let you come wash my dishes!
I said my "oven"<br/>needed "cleaning"!
I invited you into a porno!
No.
You were right. This is fate.
I needed to see<br/>you one more time
in order to know<br/>for sure about Klaus.
And...?
And...
I have a bus to catch.
Fine, you can see my boobs!
To the alley!
This seems unfair.
I mean, I get that<br/>I'm the only person
not allowed to see this, but...
it just, it-it seems unfair.
Come on, Lily, hurry up.
Guys...
You know, I'm all for honoring a<br/>bet, but who invited Takumi?
Sorry, bro.<br/>I tried.
What's going on?<br/>What am I missing?
Are they out yet?<br/>What do they look like?
Look, I don't want to know!
Just tell me the kind of coin.
Do you know how long<br/>30 seconds is?
It's going to be five seconds of...
followed by 25 seconds of....
I mean, yes,<br/>seeing Lily's boobs
is all you've ever<br/>wanted, but come on.
All he's ever wanted...
Lily, stop!
Don't you see?
This was his plan all along!
He let us think he knows how<br/>to do all this Shinjitsu stuff,
just so he could<br/>get you out here
whipping out your milk-makers!
You son of a bitch!
The bet is back on!
Nice try, Barney!
Nice try.
Maybe I was wrong.
Well, I guess that's everything<br/>you asked me to do, is it not?
Oh, wait! The shrimp<br/>in the pocket.
A modern classic.
And now...
for one minute on second base...
with a firm yet<br/>sensual squeeze...
Nothing can stop him now.
One thing can.
Make that two things.
No!!
Yeah!<br/>Yeah!
So you take her to the bus...
I take her to the bus.
Well, this feels familiar.
You leaving, me kind of<br/>wanting to say, "Don't go""
Little late for that.
Little bit.
- Don't go.<br/>- Ted...
I'm sorry. I just...
Why didn't I say it then?
Why'd I let you<br/>get on that plane?
Why didn't I get on it with you?
What would our lives be<br/>right now, if we had just...
held on?
Would I have still run into<br/>you at this party tonight...
or would we have been<br/>there together?
We'd go home...
to our home?
You cook. I do the dishes.
I'm happy that you're happy.
But damn it.
What if?
Do you really want<br/>to know the answer to that?
No.
I think it would kill me.
Good-bye, Ted.
And that was it.
Now she's probably engaged.
Maybe it's for the best.
All right. Well...
We're gonna duck out.
Sorry to leave you<br/>with the bill.
Oh, guys, it's gonna<br/>be a good year.
I'm glad you guys can laugh,
'cause I think I'm gonna<br/>be physically ill.
Coming down with a mallardy?
Oh, they look hungry.<br/>There you go.
Here you go.
Kids, there was<br/>one part I left out.
Good-bye, Ted.
Okay, yes.<br/>What's the answer?
There is a reason that it didn't<br/>work out between you and me,
but it's not Germany.
And I'm willing to bet it's the<br/>same reason none of your other
relationships in the last<br/>six years have lasted either.
It's Robin.
No.
Yes.
She is so much bigger<br/>in your world than you realize.
And this thing that you're all<br/>doing, you and Barney and Robin,
where the three of you hang out<br/>at the bar night in, night out,
like you're all just buddies?
That doesn't work. Trust me.
You-You've got it all wrong.
I'm right about this.
Good-bye, Ted.
And sure enough, she was right.
It didn't work;<br/>we just didn't realize it yet.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">I can't believe<br/>I'm talking to a therapist.
Well, usually, I'm not<br/>the touchy-feely,
talk-about-your-emotions type,
but with this, I just had<br/>to be a big enough person
to admit that I need help.
Huh. I guess this is what<br/>growing up feels like.
This is court-mandated therapy.
You assaulted a woman.
Oh...
That silly thing.
I guess we can talk about that.
It all began a few months ago.
There's this guy, Barney.<br/>We used to date.
I set him up with this girl<br/>I work with, Nora.
Barney was working hard
to prove he was<br/>real boyfriend material.
So, all week, I had to sit there<br/>watching him...
send flowers...
chocolates...
balloons.
Then one day...
Hey...
I heard Barney didn't send<br/>anything today.
Patrice said<br/>maybe he met somebody else.
She's such<br/>a bitch, right?
♪ When a man loves a woman ♪
♪ Can't keep his mind<br/>on nothin' else ♪
He's so dreamy.
Nobody asked you, Patrice!
I'm sorry.<br/>You must already think
that I'm a horrible person.
Robin, many of my patients<br/>are disturbed felons.
Last week, one of them mailed me<br/>a bag of his feces.
On the plus side,<br/>he remembered my birthday.
You're doing fine.
Well, finally, I-I just<br/>couldn't take it anymore.
I snapped.
♪ When a man, when a man,<br/>when this man ♪
♪ Loves a woman! ♪
Aw...!
And that's when<br/>the assault occurred?
Not exactly.
So, you're drunk
under a desk, binge-eating<br/>stolen chocolates.
Boy, I am not coming<br/>across great here, am I?
This is not about how<br/>you're coming across.
But no.
Okay, well, for this story<br/>to make sense,
I have to tell you about<br/>my friends Marshall and Lily.
The wine looks good.
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
pregnant women<br/>can't drink alcohol.
No, my doctor says it's okay
to have a sip of wine<br/>every now and then.
Really?
Dr. Sonya's great.
Whenever you ask her if you can<br/>have something, she's, like...
Just a little bit.
Wait, Dr. Sonya doesn't let<br/>you have sushi, does she?
Just a little bit.
You're allowed<br/>to have Cheetos?
Cheetos...
Ah, just a little bit.
You mind if I double-check
some of this stuff<br/>just in case?
I mean, it's the least<br/>I could do
as part of Team Baby.
"Team Baby"?<br/>Whoa. What's next,
like, cheesy<br/>matching T-shirts?
No.
Robin, I've had serial killers<br/>lead me
to shallow graves faster<br/>than you're telling this story.
Okay! Look, it was getting<br/>impossible for me
to be around Nora,<br/>so when an opportunity
to get rid of her<br/>presented itself...
It's Sandy time!
Huddle up, gang.
Two things: 1) Somebody stole
a very expensive bottle of wine<br/>from my office...
2) I need a producer to cover<br/>the G8 Summit in France.
Nora will do it!
I mean, I know I have<br/>seniority, but...
I was gonna ask Nora anyway.
Thanks for the support, Robin.<br/>This is huge for me.
Are, are you<br/>sure about this, Sandy?
I do have seniority.
Oh, I'm sure. Nora's amazing.
I want to have sex with her.
To deal with that rejection<br/>from Barney,
not to mention your boss...
must've really hurt.
Why don't we dig<br/>into those emotions?
So Marshall and Lily were<br/>at Dr. Sonya's office...
It's fascinating
how profoundly little I know<br/>about vaginas.
DR. SONYA<br/>Come in.
Ted, what are you<br/>doing here?!
I checked up on all the stuff
this "doctor" says is okay,<br/>and she's wrong.
So, for the health of this baby,<br/>I'm stepping in.
Sounds like this Ted guy could<br/>benefit from some therapy.
Oh, he definitely could.
This is unacceptable.
I'm sorry, we're gonna have<br/>to find a new doctor.
Guys, for the health<br/>of our baby,
Our?<br/>we have to get serious
about what Lily is<br/>putting in her body.
Speaking of which,<br/>when we deliver,
we won't be using any drugs.
Get out!
Why are you kicking me out?!
Because you're always intruding<br/>on our intimate moments!
This is like college<br/>all over again!
Man, you guys<br/>sure are messy!
There's clothes everywhere.
There's even a sock<br/>on the door!
A sock on the door<br/>is a universal code
for "We need some space."
We needed it back then,<br/>and we need it now.
Come on! We're a trio!
We've always been a trio!
We're right up there with Batman<br/>and Robin and Alfred.
Out!
Romeo and Juliet<br/>and the Apothecary.
Now!
Salt and Pepper and Cumin!
What's that little guy<br/>up there do?
Oh, you poor girl.
Robin!
It all ties together, I swear.
So, Nora was about<br/>to leave for France.
You know, not<br/>too long ago,
I would have<br/>been worried
that if I left you alone,
you'd be up to no good<br/>with some blond bimbo.
Oh, I've changed.
I know, which is why<br/>when I get back,
it's gonna be the start<br/>of a new chapter for us.
A chapter of me and you<br/>and hopefully not that tie.
You got me!
Have a nice trip!
Dr. Stinson?<br/>I saw your ad,
and I'm here for my free<br/>breast-reduction consultation.
What do you think?
Are they too big?
I can't believe you're still<br/>running plays on dumb blondes!
I thought you were<br/>serious about Nora!
No, I've been good, I swear!
I just forgot about my BDSes.
- BDSes?<br/>- Bimbo Delivery Systems.
You see, over the years,<br/>I've launched a variety
of elaborate systems that are<br/>always working to get me laid.
Like my pop-up ads.
Oh, hi.<br/>I'm Dr. Barney Stinson.
Are your really large breasts
making everyday tasks difficult?
Oh!
There's just got<br/>to be a better way!
There is!
I, Dr. Barney Stinson,<br/>for a limited time only,
can give you a free<br/>breast-reduction consultation.
Call me.
If your knockers are<br/>just too damn big,
I can handle them... it.
Women actually<br/>fell for that?
Yeah.<br/>That business really took off.
It played in all kinds<br/>of markets.
Okay, survivors,<br/>today's reward challenge
is brought to you by<br/>Dr. Barney Stinson's
Free Breast Reduction<br/>Consultations.
That scam was<br/>so successful,
it spawned a related enterprise.
If you've been fooled<br/>by a well-endowed man
who claimed to be a doctor
offering free breast-reduction<br/>consultations,
come see me, Arnie Linson,<br/>attorney-at-law,
and join my class-action suit.
If your giant breasts<br/>have been wronged,
I can handle them... it.
I got 'em comin' and goin'!
Uh-huh.
I can't believe you go
to so much trouble<br/>to get laid.
Yeah, sometimes I don't<br/>even have to shower.
Mama loves it musky.
I gotta shut down all these<br/>systems before Nora gets back.
How am I gonna do all that<br/>in three days?
I'll help you.
Maybe you should write<br/>on your little chart there:
"Patient selflessly tried<br/>to help a friend in need."
First of all, this is<br/>a crossword puzzle.
Secondly, you were clearly<br/>planning on using
those three days<br/>to steal Barney back.
I am his friend! How dare you!
God, you think you're so smart<br/>just because
you went to Harvard
and then Princeton
and then... wow,<br/>Harvard again.
Okay, yes, fine.
I was... I was trying<br/>to steal him back.
This is good.<br/>You're finally opening up
and talking about yourself,
not just what Marshall<br/>and Lily were up to.
Oh, yeah, so Marshall and Lily<br/>were folding laundry...
That one's my fault.
You know...
Never mind.
It's just...
Forget it.
Marshall, you're<br/>a grown-ass man.
If you want to say<br/>something, just say it.
I feel bad for Ted!<br/>And if my mom were here,
she would ask me what was wrong.
You feel bad for Ted?!
It's tough feeling<br/>like the third wheel.
Okay, first of all,<br/>I'm sure Ted's fine.
Who eats salt and pepper<br/>without cumin?
Second, Ted is way off base<br/>coming after Dr. Sonya.
We love her! Right?
Don't tell me<br/>you're doubting Dr. Sonya!
Just a little bit.
What's that thing?
Well, for some women, it was<br/>the ashes of my parents.
For others, it was the trophy<br/>from Wimbledon.
And believe it or not, for<br/>one busty dullard, it was both.
Game, enormous set, match.
Hello?
Oh, yeah, thanks<br/>for calling me back.
Uh, Barney,
It's Mitch<br/>from the Port Authority.
Port Authority Mitch.<br/>You'd always call me whenever
a wide-eyed farm girl<br/>would get off the bus
with big dreams of Broadway<br/>and no idea
what a "casting director"<br/>could legally ask her to do,
hold or lick during an audition.
I'm sorry, old friend,
your services are<br/>no longer needed.
Oh, God, I can't believe<br/>I'm doing this over the phone!
My love to Marge and the kids!
I know. Here.
I didn't realize this would be so hard!<br/>I know, I know.
But hey, you know what? We're<br/>almost through our checklist.
- Okay? Okay?<br/>- Okay.
Which reminds me,
why am I calling a hair salon<br/>and saying,
"Jack Fantastic is quitting"?
Sweetheart,
it's like Maya Angelou<br/>keeps telling Oprah,
and I keep telling you:
When you know better,<br/>you do better.
Wow, you are so wise.
I wish you were straight<br/>so I could date you.
Well...
as a matter of fact, I have<br/>an extremely attractive
straight twin brother!
Oh, hi.
I cropped that Halloween photo.
It's just salt and pepper, now,<br/>so it looks ridiculous.
Ted, I want you back on Team Baby.<br/>What?
I knew you'd come around!
Guys! I didn't really<br/>crop the photo!
Plus...
Good news.
I signed us up for<br/>a birthing class.
Well, that's insane.
It's way too early for<br/>that, right, Marshall?
Okay, listen. I am the<br/>father of this child,
and I vote that we go<br/>to the birthing class.
Absolutely not.
'Kay, Lily.
I hate to play this card...
but if you don't<br/>come to this class...
I'm withholding sex.
I don't think she's coming.
Yeah.
I was a little suspicious when<br/>she had us take separate cabs.
Lily, don't do it!
Just a little bit.
Think about our baby!
You got to be kidding me,<br/>Robin. Get to the assault.
Okay, fine.
So Barney and I were finishing<br/>packing his apartment...
Okay. One last item<br/>on the checklist.
Disconnect the Cold Call 5000.
What the hell's that?
I was able to secure the<br/>customer database from a company
that sells body glitter<br/>and high-end pasties.
The Cold Call 5000 will<br/>dial every female client
between the ages of 22 and 23,
and leave the following message:
Hi, I know this is crazy,
but I saw you on the subway,<br/>and I knew we were meant to be.
If you believe in destiny,<br/>come to MacLaren's tonight
and find me, Barney Stinson.
Because I have this feeling that<br/>I'm supposed to be on you--
with you.
Why not re-record it?
I did like a hundred takes.<br/>It kept happening.
I can't believe<br/>Lily's not coming!
You know what? Screw it!
Who says that two bros<br/>can't rock a birthing class?
Rock it!
Today, we'll be exploring<br/>"The Sensual Massage."
Let's start by gently cupping<br/>our partner's hands...
and just breathe each other in.
Thanks, Robin.
You're the only person I know<br/>who would help me do all that.
You're a real bro.
Am I, though?
'Cause I'm really<br/>more of a woman.
To my femininity.
Nah, you're more of a bro.
You're a dude.<br/>You're a man.
Hey, you are flying<br/>solo one more night.
How about I put on<br/>a smokin' hot dress,
you slap a vest over<br/>that crime scene of a tie
and we paint the town?
I mean, when was the last time<br/>we got rip-roaring drunk
in clothing that<br/>highlights our genders?
So, your plan was to<br/>be out on the town,
dressed provocatively, drinking<br/>with another woman's man.
Robin, this is our<br/>first session, and
I know this is just one<br/>clinical opinion, but...
you a dawg!
Yeah...
There was just one problem...
Surprise!
I got back early!
Hey!
Let me guess,
you got drunk<br/>under your desk again?
No, Mr. Harvard. I handled<br/>things a little differently...
So, I suppose now you want me<br/>to talk about how it felt
watching Barney and Nora<br/>walk off together, right?
I'd rather just skip ahead<br/>to the assault.
My next patient thinks he's God.
On the off chance<br/>that he's right,
I really don't want<br/>to keep him waiting.
Well, right after they left,<br/>something crazy happened.
Excuse me, do you know where<br/>I can find Barney Stinson?
He saw me on the subway and left<br/>me a message to meet him here.
Why not re-record it?
I did like a hundred takes.<br/>It kept happening.
Hi, I know this is crazy,
but I saw you on the subway...
He asked me if I believed<br/>in destiny. And I do.
We are so meant to be.
Where can I find him?
So I was faced<br/>with a moral dilemma.
Unleash this nut bag on them
or be a bigger person,<br/>and help my friend.
Barney's at Café L'Amour,<br/>75th and Amsterdam.
- Awesome!<br/>- No, wait, wait, wait!
Okay, this isn't right.
Let's pop that top<br/>button, show off your gals.
Ooh! Good luck, go get 'em!
Let your love come<br/>through your fingers.
Dude, the rule is no moaning
and keep your eyes<br/>open at all times.
Stop being weird.
And hey, when do I<br/>get to be the woman?
Now remember, the most<br/>important thing in pregnancy
is to keep Mom calm and happy.
She knows best what she needs.
Trust her.
Now, Papas,
I want you to take<br/>Mom's hands in yours,
look deep into her eyes,
and repeat after me.
I believe in you.
I believe in you.
I honor your body's wisdom.
I honor your body's wisdom.
Your womb is a temple.
- Your womb is a--<br/>- Okay, I get it!
I feel terrible we didn't<br/>listen to what Lily wanted!
I know, so do I.
The truth is, I thought<br/>I'd be married by now
and going through all this<br/>stuff alongside you guys.
But even if I meet the girl of<br/>my dreams right this second,
I'm still one night<br/>and nine months away
from having a family<br/>of my own.
And that's assuming the<br/>mother of my children
is just a huge slut.
Don't lose hope, Ted.
That slut is out there.
Thanks, buddy.
We owe Lily an apology.
Yeah.
Dads, this is the time that<br/>I'll answer every question
you've ever had about vaginas.
Damn it!
Hey.
I'm so sorry, Lily.
You have just a little bit.
I realize now that it's my job<br/>for the next seven months
to keep you happy,<br/>and that's why...
I'm no longer withholding sex.
My hero.
But I want to make sure<br/>that you feel comfortable
with Dr. Sonya, too.
I do. And you know what,
the fact that she's so calm<br/>and laid back,
maybe that's not a bad thing.
Maybe that's exactly<br/>what we're gonna want
in that delivery room.
Lily, if you don't push, I will<br/>shove this baby up your throat
and pull it out of your mouth!
Where the hell is Marshall?!
That's a crazy story, kids.
I'll get to that.
Hey, Ted's out<br/>in the hall.
He wants to apologize, too.
Hey.
What happened to your sock?
Long story. Bottom line,<br/>I realized that sometimes
love means taking a step back.
Well, not always.
I mean, sometimes it's<br/>better to interfere
and sabotage stuff, right?
Well, I think if you<br/>care about somebody,
you should want them<br/>to be happy,
even if you wind up<br/>being left out.
Wow.
The lesson you learned<br/>with Lily and Marshall
is directly applicable<br/>to my situation,
and is therefore
a valid part of how I'll<br/>eventually tell this story.
Really?
That's how that went down?
Point is, it all<br/>tied together, right?
Not really at all.
Can we just get to the assault?
To us!
Barney, it's me!
I love you, Barney!
Mmm, scallops look good.
Oh, they are.
But the last time I was here<br/>they ran out, so, uh...
knock... on... wood.
Well, I have my eye on the<br/>red velvet cake for dessert.
Lovely. Splitsies?
Nah, I want it<br/>all to myself.
Really?
Arm wrestle for it?
No!
All right.
I love this place.
- Thank you, babe.<br/>- You're welcome.
Babe.
Barney doesn't know a thing<br/>about any of this.
But that's why I got<br/>court-mandated therapy.
You must think I'm nuts.
I think you're<br/>a really good friend.
Really?
Really.
As far as I'm concerned,<br/>there was no criminal intent
to this assault.
Well, thanks, Doc!
Well, look at us!
We got this wrapped up<br/>in one session.
Go us, right?
Now let's discuss how you<br/>keyed the judge's car.
Okay. Um...
Here's how it happened:
Marshall and Lily were supposed<br/>to go to the zoo--
okay, it all ties together,<br/>I swear. Now...
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in October 2011,<br/>your Aunt Robin was in therapy.
And against all logic,<br/>it was actually going well.
But why?
Why-why am I constantly looking<br/>for reasons not to be happy?
Maybe because the idea of<br/>finally being happy...
terrifies you.
Bro, you are killing it today.
Pshh!
We got something good here.
We are totes gonna conquer<br/>my fear of abandonment!
I can't see you anymore.
Nice.
"Oh, no! You're<br/>abandoning me!"
Oh, no. You're abandoning me?
I'm sorry.<br/>I'm moving to Alaska.
And that might have<br/>been the end of it.
But a week later...
Kevin?!
What are you doing here?
Okay, look, I lied to you<br/>about moving to Alaska.
I-I had to stop seeing you.
Why?
'Cause I think you're cute.
And ethically,<br/>I can't be your therapist
if I'm attracted to you.
Oh, I get it. You dump me<br/>as a patient
just so you can ask me out?
I'm not gonna ask you out.
You're not?
No. We met in therapy.
It's inappropriate for me<br/>to date a patient.
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.
Hey, wait.
How do you define "date"?
Two people having a meal<br/>together,
sitting across the table
making googly eyes<br/>at each other...
What about two people eating<br/>alone, sitting side by side,
making googly eyes<br/>at the coffee maker?
Okay, it's not a date.
Exactly. Not a date.
And so Robin and Kevin had<br/>breakfast alone,
side by side<br/>every day that week.
Until finally...
Oh, hey!
Sorry. No cabs.
Ran 40 blocks<br/>all the way here.
May have knocked an old lady
into the street,<br/>don't know, I didn't look back.
Let's just go on a real date.
Yeah, that might be a good idea.
Finally!
♪
Oh, I can't wait<br/>to see that movie.
Is it good?
Awesome. Wait, totally<br/>hypothetically,
do you like movies with a<br/>shocking twist where all
the main characters die<br/>at the end?
Yes.
You will love this movie.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Marshall.<br/>What's up?
Well, I'll tell you what's up.
You know how my boss,<br/>Garrison Cootes, is,
like, the most famous<br/>environmental lawyer
in the world?
Yeah...
I mean, it's him<br/>or the other guy.
Sir Anthony Howel?
Yeah...
Anyway, he's an important guy,<br/>okay?
And so today at work,
I was trying to show him<br/>that I'm tough.
I've been thinking<br/>about this
settlement offer we're about
to get from Gruber<br/>Pharmaceuticals.
If it's anything less<br/>than $20 million,
then I'm gonna grab
those corporate Earth rapists<br/>by their...
Okay, I'm just gonna<br/>say something.
I'm growing a child<br/>in my belly,
a child that just<br/>developed ears.
This is a very<br/>thin sweater.
So please, if you must<br/>tell your story...
just make it<br/>cheerful.
Cheerful.
Okay...
Then I'm gonna grab those<br/>corporate...
employees...
by their sweaty, dangling...
hands...
and squeeze until those greedy<br/>sons of...
parents... realize that<br/>I'm the baddest mother...
nature lover around.
It's like watching<br/>The Breakfast Club on TBS.
So what did he say?
Marshall, bend down so I<br/>can put my arm around you.
That's all the way down.<br/>That's good.
Gruber Pharmaceuticals<br/>is a company full
of well-meaning people<br/>doing their jobs,
just like you and me.
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison<br/>Cootes has gone soft!
He's like a teddy bear!
A teddy bear<br/>or an Ewok?
You know, cute and cuddly<br/>around the village,
but once the battle starts...
He'll smash in your metal skull<br/>with giant swinging logs.
Marshall!
Okay, he'll hug you
until you agree to peaceably<br/>shut down the Death Star.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey.
What are we<br/>all talking about?
Ewoks.
Ugh, I hate the Ewoks.
The only good<br/>thing about Ewoks in that movie?
You got to see some of them die.
Well, I fancy a pint.
Nora hates Ewoks.
Well, I have<br/>to break up with her.
Be gentle<br/>when you tell her, guys.
I'll call you from Vegas.<br/>Tell me how it went. Okay.
Okay, Barney!
Sit down!
Not liking Ewoks
is no reason not<br/>to date somebody.
Yeah, I mean, who knows<br/>what the rules are, ya know?
I mean, you're dating<br/>a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,
I'm dating my former<br/>therapist.
- Oh!<br/>- Eww!
We are<br/>gentlemen of Harvard!
It's not a big deal!
Robin, if you asked<br/>a hundred people,
"Who's the worst person<br/>you could possibly date?"
they'd all say,<br/>"Your therapist."
Except the ones<br/>saying "Barney."
Hey! Yeah, that tracks.
Well, I should<br/>get going.
I got the big field<br/>trip tomorrow.
Field trip?
Yeah. I'm taking
my Intro to<br/>Architecture class
to the GNB Tower<br/>construction site.
I'm trying to get<br/>them interested
in architecture<br/>as a career.
Why? Are we running out<br/>of buildings?
Are we running out<br/>of boring people?
Guys, this is<br/>a big deal, okay?
If I can get just<br/>one kid interested in
becoming an architect...
Okay, I'm just gonna stop<br/>you right there.
Ted, it's an Intro class.
Yeah, don't try to<br/>Stand and Deliver
an Intro class.
Nobody takes an Intro class<br/>to get on any other path
but the path to not<br/>being hungover anymore.
I learned that in my Intro<br/>to something-ology class.
Well that's fine for<br/>something-ology,
but tomorrow<br/>at 9:00 a.m. sharp
Intro to Architecture is<br/>going on a field trip!
All 200 of 'em.
Well, it's 9:45.
I guess the other 170<br/>of you got lost,
so we'll just start.
Now, some might say you guys are<br/>just taking this class
because it's easy or because<br/>you've confused architecture
with archaeology and think<br/>we're gonna do
some cool<br/>Indiana Jones stuff today.
But I think that...
I think just maybe, we got some<br/>future architects in the house.
Show of hands: who's thinking<br/>about a career in architecture?
Well, today,<br/>all that's gonna change.
Follow me.
Hey. Uh, sorry,
nobody gets in here<br/>without a site pass.
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the<br/>architect of this building.
I don't care if you're the<br/>archaeologist of this building.
Site's closed.
Moving on!
That morning, Marshall's firm
was getting<br/>the settlement offer
from Gruber Pharmaceuticals,<br/>and Marshall couldn't wait
to see the teddy bear<br/>turn into an Ewok.
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped<br/>toxic waste into Frog Creek,
a tributary of the Trout River<br/>that feeds into Clearwater Lake.
All three of which<br/>now need new names.
So it's time to win one<br/>for Mother Earth.
Let's take out the trash,<br/>shall we?!
- Yes!<br/>- All right, everyone grab a bag.
Blue is recycling,<br/>green, compost.
There we go.
Sheila...
we're ready to hear your offer.
$24,000?
Yeah , that seems reasonable.
Kids, I was wandering the city
with 25 Intro to Architecture<br/>students
when your Uncle Barney<br/>came to my rescue.
Okay, guys, seeing a building<br/>get built, not that exciting.
What's really exciting is the<br/>financial side of...
Sit down, Ted, I got this.
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!
College...<br/>it's a confusing time.
Oh, no.
Studies show that 83% of all<br/>college students
desperately need...
sex lessons!
Lights!
Barney, these are<br/>18-year-olds!
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!
You have a girlfriend.
But she doesn't like Ewoks!
So what?
So what?!<br/>Bieber, lights!
In 1983, George Lucas introduced<br/>the world to the Ewoks,
a race of creatures indigenous<br/>to the second moon of Endor.
Now, the Ewoks have<br/>a rich back-story
that the movie didn't<br/>really go into.
Barney, why don't<br/>you just skip
to the part<br/>about you and Nora?
Fine.
Ah, yes.
Ultimately, Ewoks split Star<br/>Wars fandom into two camps:
those born before, and those<br/>born after May 25, 1973:
the Ewok Line.
Anyone born on this side<br/>of the Ewok Line was
at least ten years<br/>old when Jedi came out,
and thus too old for something<br/>so cloying and cute.
Anyone born on this side<br/>loved the Ewoks because, why?
They reminded you of...
Our teddies?
They reminded you<br/>of your teddies.
Thank you, Gina.
How do you know her name?
And so... by the immutable laws<br/>of the Ewok Line,
my 29-year-old girlfriend<br/>who hates Ewoks
must in fact be<br/>no younger than... 37.
That's only a year younger<br/>than Will's mom.
How do you know my mom?<br/>Class dismissed!
I need to be alone.
All right, we're moving on.
Ooh, can I come?
Hey, baby.
Hey, I just want to remind you<br/>we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.
I'll be there. I'm sorry.<br/>I'm just... I'm bummed.
We got<br/>our settlement offer today:
$24,000 from<br/>a billion-dollar company.
Wow. I take it people aren't<br/>happy about that.
We won! Champagne and cake<br/>for everybody!
They're celebrating.
I mean, it's crazy.
We have no right<br/>to be eating cake.
There's cake?! I'm on my way!
Meanwhile, the worst field trip<br/>of all time was still trucking.
All right, this, this is<br/>exciting, okay?
This is the very room
where I had the idea<br/>for the GNB Tower.
Now, Webster's defines<br/>"inspiration" as...
Hold on.<br/>It's still loading.
Uh, hey, roomie.
Robin! Hey,<br/>what are you doing here?
Well, I was about<br/>to get my swerve on.
You were?
So you're the therapist.
You know, it's one thing<br/>to pretend to be a shrink
and bang your patients.<br/>That's normal.
But to do it for real?<br/>A little creepy, bro.
Okay, it's not creepy.
Ehhhh... it's creepy.
Class, show of hands:
Who thinks it's creepy<br/>to date your therapist?
- Pollstered.<br/>- Get out!
All right.<br/>We're moving on!
So, class, to your left,
you will see some<br/>excellent examples of
what we'd call windows.
So where are we going now?
I have no idea.
This is a disaster.
Some of them are already<br/>starting to go home.
Although we seem to have<br/>picked up a German family.
Wait a minute.<br/>Wait a minute.
That thing with Robin<br/>and her creepy therapist
gave me an idea.
Ted, we have here a way
to solve every single debate<br/>we've ever had!
I mean, just look at the sample:
guys, girls,<br/>blacks, Asians, a German family.
You can't pay for that kind of<br/>focus group!
Is macaroni salad<br/>really a salad?
Hands up if you say "no."
Ha!
Jacob or Edward?
Who says Edward?
Ha, ha. See?<br/>I told you.
It's Edward<br/>James Olmos.
Would you rather have sex<br/>with a dead human being
or a live an...?<br/>Dude.
What?<br/>Find the line.
Who thinks David<br/>Hasselhoff is awesome?
Hmm.<br/>It's true.
Okay. I've got one.<br/>If you're dating a girl,
and she lies<br/>about her age,
who says break up<br/>with her?
Yes, yes, but what if<br/>the person she's lying to
is notoriously<br/>shallow about age?
Okay, but what if early<br/>in our relationship,
she made a really big deal
about wanting to not<br/>lie to each other?
What if she's hot?
Who wants five bucks?
Pollstered!
Let's do this.
Hmm? Yeah.
Mm...
Okay, this is creepy.
It's Crispin<br/>Glover creepy.
You were my patient.
You shared intimate stuff.
It would be like dating<br/>your gynecologist.
You were vulnerable.
That's not something<br/>we can move past.
Guess not.
So, dating your gyno,<br/>that's bad, too?
Oh, Robin.
Kidding!
Look, we've got another one!
Come on,<br/>have a bite.
No, it's a matter<br/>of principle.
I don't care how good it is,
I'm not gonna have<br/>a third piece of cake!
Okay, guys, you all had<br/>a lot of fun today,
but now it's time...<br/>to have even more fun!
Another cake!
Another cake?!
What is the matter<br/>with you people?!
That settlement today was<br/>a flaming pile of...
puppies...
that aren't on fire!
Look at what's happening<br/>to the environment,
and we're here doing the limbo?
I mean, we should be ashamed<br/>of ourselves!
Sir, all I meant was...
Ten years from right now,
everyone outside in that bullpen<br/>will be dead.
What?
I've seen the<br/>latest research, Marsh.
You know how I'm always saying
it's not too late<br/>to save the planet?
It's too late<br/>to save the planet.
There's nothing to do<br/>but sit back
and await our inevitable doom.
Oh, my goodness, a piñata!
Just give me one minute, Larry.
Thank you.
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!
Now, of course,<br/>you can't go around
telling all the people
that the good ship<br/>Environmentalism
has sailed off into the sunset.
There would cause a panic.
So, instead,<br/>what we do is,
we come to work,<br/>we put on a happy face,
and we sue the big guys
for just enough money<br/>for some cake
before the unfiltered rays<br/>of the sun fry us like chalupas,
and our lungs fill up<br/>with salt water,
and we all die!
Mmm. This cake is delicious.<br/>Everything's fine.
Ugh, this day sucks.
Kevin and I are kaputski.
You think that's bad?
The world is<br/>coming to an end.
You think that's bad?
My girlfriend is 37!
And my field trip is not going<br/>as well as I'd hoped.
Hmm.
This day sucks.
Professor Mosby,<br/>is the field trip over?
We'd like to go home.
Yeah, it's over.
Auf wiedersehen.
I just wanted<br/>to inspire them,
you know, like my professors<br/>inspired me.
But here we are,<br/>at the end of the day...
Hey, class,<br/>quick question.
Uh, is anyone here thinking<br/>of becoming an architect?
Really?
Yeah, dude.<br/>I mean,
all jobs suck,
but it's 4:00<br/>in the afternoon,
and you're out at a bar<br/>with your friends,
so the hours can't<br/>be that bad.
So...
yeah, I don't know,<br/>I'd think about it.
I got through to you. Oh!
I mean, that is, if becoming<br/>a deejay doesn't pan out.
You are gonna be<br/>a great architect.
He became a deejay.
Robin, what are you doing here?
I told you I can't<br/>be your therapist.
I know.
Today, I am your therapist.
What?
You said yourself,
I'm always looking for reasons<br/>not to be happy.
Well, I'm trying to change that.
So, if the only reason<br/>we can't be together
is because I was<br/>in a vulnerable place
for the first two hours<br/>we knew each other
then that is two hours of<br/>vulnerability you owe me.
Sit down.
Okay.
Okay, but I must warn you, as a<br/>professional, I'm immune to...
Tell me about your mother.
Everything she says<br/>is a manipulation!
When I was<br/>seven years old...
Mr. Cootes.
- Hey.<br/>- Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said<br/>yesterday,
about how we're all gonna die.
Oh, I'm not gonna die.
I bought an old mine shaft<br/>in Colorado.
I've spent the last six months<br/>filling it with canned goods,
assault rifles and all five<br/>seasons of Friday Night Lights.
Okay, first of all,<br/>you can skip season two.
Second of all, after our talk...
I came pretty close<br/>to giving up myself.
But then I went to the doctor<br/>with my wife...
and...
I saw this.
Boy or girl?
I don't know.
But I know I sure as hell<br/>can't give up now.
So, if you're just looking<br/>for someone
to hold the other end<br/>of the limbo stick,
you got the wrong guy for<br/>the job, and you know why?
'Cause you're three feet taller<br/>than everyone in this office?
No. Because if I am<br/>gonna work here,
then first thing<br/>tomorrow morning,
I'm walking down<br/>to Gruber Pharmaceuticals,
and I'm rejecting their offer.
Even if I have to do it myself.
Listen, I want you<br/>to know... I know.
Know what?
Nora.
Barney.
Nora.
Just say what you're gonna say!
I know you're old!
And I've been struggling<br/>with it,
but when I look at you...
I don't care,<br/>because I really like you.
And because for 37,<br/>you are keeping it toit!
You think I'm 37?
Well, if you were really 29,
then you would have<br/>been a little kid
the first time you saw the Ewoks<br/>and you would have loved them.
Barney, I didn't see<br/>any of the Star Wars
movies until last year.
You... you're 29!
You still have<br/>one good year left.
- What?<br/>- Nothing.
Mm...
But Naveen's the neurosurgeon,
so of course he gets<br/>all the attention!
Oh, Naveen is so smart,
he operates on people's brains!
Well, guess what, Mom?!
I treat the human mind!
Our time is up.
I don't think<br/>this is gonna work.
I scared you off, didn't I?
No, I mean, I don't think<br/>I can be your therapist.
You're really cute.
The next day,
Marshall returned to<br/>Gruber Pharmaceuticals alone.
I mean, you admit<br/>that you polluted the lake.
We got the evidence.
We got the charts.
The fish...
Fish, huh?
Fish are weird.
You ever think<br/>about the names of fish?
I mean, come on.
Carp.
Garrison, what a nice surprise.
Your star apprentice<br/>was just, uh...
"Floundering."
Little, little<br/>fish humor
for you guys.
It was not going well.
I'm here to turn<br/>down the 24,000.
Well, I can maybe get you<br/>24,500.
Not... good... enough.
Where are we going?
To war, son.
We're going to war.
We're going to save the planet.
And kids, as we now know,<br/>they did.
Hey, you know<br/>what was on last night?
- Stand and Deliver.<br/>- Mm.
- So good.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Whatever happened<br/>to Jacob James Olmos?
Who?
Jacob James Olmos.<br/>Whatever happened to that guy?
He never existed.
It's Edward James Olmos.
You're Olmos correct.
It's Jacob James Olmos.
- It's Edward James Olmos.<br/>- Jacob James Olmos.
Edward James Olmos.
- You're joking, right...?<br/>- Are you serious...?
- Seriously.<br/>- Jacob James Olmos.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">By the fall of 2011,<br/>technology had taken
a lot of the intrigue<br/>out of life.
The Internet had everyone's<br/>wall of information.
Nothing was a mystery anymore.
But, kids, there was<br/>a time before that,
way back in the dark ages.
Are you people insane?!
The most popular food in America<br/>is the cheeseburger!
No way! It's pizza!
Are we forgetting about<br/>a certain Mr. Furter,
first name Frank?
Um, what did every kid<br/>bring in their lunchbox
every day till<br/>grade eight?
Pancakes with<br/>maple syrup.
Thanks, Canada.
We're looking for a food<br/>the average American eats.
- Yeah. Yeah.<br/>- Oh!
Chinese food.
And then came the smartphone.
Hey, remember
when we were arguing about<br/>the most popular food?
It's bread.
Hm.
And the barroom debate<br/>was dead.
You guys are idiots!
Okay, not completely dead.<br/>You are seriously telling me
you don't want<br/>to open that envelope
and find out if you're<br/>having a boy or a girl?
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us<br/>this in case we wanted to know.
But we don't.
Lilypad and I are just gonna<br/>wait till that baby pops out
and enjoy the big surprise.
Look, I have pretended<br/>to be a licensed therapist
enough times to know<br/>there is something unhealthy
about your not wanting<br/>to find out.
- Back me up here, Kev.<br/>- No, no, no, no, no.
This real therapist<br/>won't risk upsetting
his wonderful new girlfriend by<br/>analyzing her wonderful friends.
No matter how mentally<br/>unbalanced they may be.
I hear you.
I don't think you do.
We just don't want to<br/>burden our little angel
with all kinds of<br/>gender-specific expectations.
Boys can do ballet;<br/>girls can play football.
Hell, the Green Bay<br/>Packers have been
proving that for years.
That would've gotten<br/>a big laugh at a sports bar.
Well, I say define<br/>gender roles early.
All the other girls<br/>got a pretty dress
and a cake when<br/>they turned 14.
Me...
I want to go home, Daddy!
That direction is<br/>nothing but wolves.
And 40 kilometers that way<br/>is the mining town of Smithers.
I'd take my chances<br/>with the wolves.
I'll see you in three days.
Well, wait, wh-what<br/>am I supposed to eat?
Hey, you've got a knife,<br/>the forest is full of animals--
what do you want, a buffet?
Papa...!
Happy birthday, son...!
Got any thoughts<br/>on that, Doc?
If you guys think I'm going near<br/>that, you're crazy.
Why'd you<br/>emphasize "you're"?
No reason.<br/>You're pretty.
By the way, do you guys want<br/>to come over tomorrow night
for sangria and tapas?
Si. Muchas gracias.<br/>That sounds awesome.
Great. We're also<br/>gonna paint the nursery.
Oh, and a quick update<br/>on the sangria and tapas--
that's cancelled.<br/>Mmm...
Guess what smooth<br/>son of a bitch
just picked up<br/>a girl at the bar?
Barney, you're cheating<br/>on Nora already?
No, guys, it's me.
Janet McIntyre.
Struck up a conversation<br/>at the bar
while ordering, she guessed<br/>bread right away,
we laughed, it was<br/>a thing, boom, going
out tomorrow night.
- So, she said yes just like that?<br/>- Just like that.
There's<br/>something wrong with her.
No, no, no, no.
Stop it. They<br/>always do this.
Every time I go<br/>on a first date,
they snap right into<br/>research mode.
It started by accident.
Ooh.
Hello?
Ted, we did a little<br/>Internet research
on your Mia Plumley.
We just sent you
a picture of her<br/>from six months ago.
I don't understand--<br/>is Mia standing behind
this morbidly obese wo...<br/>Oh, my God!
They had cookies and cream.
And what you were saying<br/>about how women feel
they have to starve themselves<br/>makes so much sense.
Ooh, hot dogs. Score!
After that, background checks
became standard<br/>operating procedure.
The date with Nadine went great.
Unless you guys found something.
Are you sitting down?
No.
She's wanted in Florida<br/>on crystal meth charges.
She breeds pit bulls<br/>for dog fighting.
- Also, the FBI...<br/>- What's this link?
Oh, she also writes<br/>online movie reviews.
Anyway, she's still married to<br/>a death row inmate convicted...
She gave Annie Hall<br/>two out of ten stars?
"Slow and overrated"?
Really? That's<br/>your takeaway?
It's the Wood Man at<br/>the height of his powers.
The way he broke the fourth wall<br/>by talking directly to camera?
People have been<br/>ripping that off ever since.
Can you believe this guy?
Paula Vincenzo.
She's in the bathroom.
What's wrong with her?
Total psycho.<br/>Her Facebook wall
has a link to a site about<br/>dating inanimate objects.
For most of last year,<br/>she was engaged...
to a mini fridge.<br/>And there's pictures:
her and the mini<br/>fridge on a hike,
her and the mini fridge<br/>in wine country,
here's the mini fridge<br/>meeting her parents...
Run like the wind.
So... want to go<br/>back to my place?
Yeah, all right.
Well, thanks to us,<br/>you ran screaming from
that freak show, right?
- Absolutely.<br/>- Cuckoo!
So what's the problem?
You need us.
No, I don't, okay?
I don't want a<br/>background check.
I want adventure<br/>and excitement.
Look, if it's<br/>a choice
between mystery<br/>and history,
I want mystery.
In fact...
Ted, I wouldn't...
Uh, Janet.
I have a theory.<br/>People don't get the chance
to just discover<br/>each other anymore, so...
here's my idea.
Before we go out tomorrow,
let's not do any prior<br/>Internet research on each other.
It sounds like I'm hiding something<br/>horrible, doesn't it?
I'm pretty sure<br/>you're a serial killer.
I'm not. I'm not.
It's just, you know, like,<br/>when my parents met,
they didn't have the Internet--<br/>they just went out
on a blind date<br/>and fell in love.
That's nice.<br/>And they're still together?
Right up to the divorce.
The point is, I'd love<br/>to get to know you
in person, not on my computer.
I like that.<br/>What started out
sounding really creepy<br/>turned out really sweet.
That's kind of my move.
And she was
on board with the whole<br/>"no Internet" thing?
She loved it.
The bitch is<br/>hiding something.
The bitch is totally<br/>hiding something.
Hey, Ted, before you leave--
is Janet McIntyre<br/>M-A-C or M-C?
For the last time,<br/>I don't want to know
anything about her<br/>before the date.
You might want to see this,<br/>Ted-- naked pictures.
That's not Janet.
Who, now?
Seriously...
if you guys respect<br/>me as a friend...
stop looking.
Well, Ted was pretty<br/>clear there, so...
let's shut those laptops
and go help Lily and Marshall,<br/>just like we promised.
Let's leave
the laptops here<br/>and go paint that baby room.
Without laptops.
Or bring the laptops.<br/>Either way.
This is exciting.
I give you...
the color our child<br/>will grow up with.
Yellow, like the sun.
Or daughter.<br/>Pun snuggle.
Oh, God, this room's about<br/>to get its first spit-up.
Just open the envelope already!
Kevin, will you please<br/>tell Barney that it is
perfectly normal for us to want<br/>to preserve the mystery.
I'm not here to analyze; I'm<br/>here to win boyfriend points.
By the way, you all<br/>look great, especially Robin.
Come on, if you don't<br/>know the gender,
you're gonna get generic crap<br/>at the baby shower.
But if you do know the gender,
you'll get, oh,<br/>I don't know, this!
Marshall! Lights!
Okay.
When little Jack's<br/>not turning double plays,
he's turning heads with this
home run of an outfit!
And if it's a little girl...
This royal ensemble<br/>may leave you speechless,
but it's sure to make<br/>little Sally say,
"I wuv you, Mommy,<br/>and I wuv my dress,
and I would love<br/>to see you in the shower."
Sorry, I kind of fell out of<br/>character in that last part.
But if you don't<br/>know the gender...
Little Fran is sure to be<br/>the pariah of the playground
in this hermaphroditic<br/>burlap sack.
♪ ♪
Marshall! Lights!
Barney,
you don't really care abo'.
No. You just
can't stand
not knowing something.
That's ridiculous!
Marshall, will you...
will you hold<br/>these for a second?
Yeah, sure. Why?
Because I gots to know!
Oh, Barney, no!<br/>Help! Get him off of me!
Everybody hold it!<br/>Hold it!
I found Janet McIntyre,<br/>who's been widowed three times.
She's obviously<br/>killing her husbands!
Oh, my God!
They're six minutes<br/>into the date.
Ted's probably already told her<br/>that he loves her!
We've got to get down there!
Nobody's going anywhere!
Why?!
Kids, at that moment,
Kevin thought back<br/>to his earlier rule...
This real therapist<br/>won't risk
upsetting his wonderful<br/>new girlfriend
by analyzing her<br/>wonderful friends.
...and threw it out the window.
You're all the most<br/>codependent, incestuous,
controlling group of<br/>people I've ever met!
By the way, you all look<br/>great, especially Robin.
Oh, mm-mm.
This is so great.
Right? See, if we'd<br/>researched each other,
we'd both be secretly<br/>steering the conversation
one way or the other.
But this is<br/>more exciting, right?
Way more exciting.
I mean, we can talk<br/>about anything we want.
Anything.
So...
...how was the traffic<br/>getting here?
You picked me up<br/>at my apartment.
I certainly did.
Oh, my God,
I've lost the ability to talk<br/>to girls without the Internet.
My brain is<br/>completely shutting down.
So, are you folks gonna have<br/>dinner or just drinks?
I-I don't know.
What the hell<br/>was that, Kevin?
We're all crazy just because
I'm looking up some stuff<br/>on the Internet,
and Barney wants<br/>to know the baby's gender?
Well, to be honest,
I noticed some<br/>other disturbing...
Never mind.
It's nothing. I'm sorry.
I gots to know!
Okay, last night alone...
When-When are you coming back?
Because I miss you, silly!
Wait, who's he talking to?
Shh, I'll be back soon.
Yeah, you want me<br/>to bring you a pretzel?
Ted's texting me<br/>from the bathroom.
Oh.
I don't get it.
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.<br/>- Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Sometimes when one<br/>of us is on the can,
we'll, uh, sneak a peek<br/>and then text each other,
you know.
Symbols to describe what your<br/>bowel movement looks like?
This morning,<br/>I took an ampersand.
Last summer,<br/>I dropped a deuce
that actually looked<br/>like the number two!
When you worked<br/>late Wednesday,
I... I got<br/>lonely and...
I watched Survivor<br/>without you.
Practically the only unhealthy<br/>behavior I didn't see
from you people<br/>was physical violence.
Yeah.
At least we don't do that.
And to top it off,
all the meddling<br/>in Ted's love life,
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?
It all strikes me as<br/>just deeply dysfunctional.
So what you're saying is,<br/>we're fine?
So, while this font is often
mistaken for Helvetica,
the fact is...
it's Helvetica Bold.
I can actually hear the sound
of her vagina being boarded up.
I got to be honest, Janet.
First of all...<br/>this is Times New Roman.
Second, I'm having trouble
coming up with things<br/>to talk about.
You? I'm sitting here thinking,
"Damn it, I wish I had something<br/>as good as that font thing.
That's gold."
Guys, I'm so sorry<br/>I said anything.
Um, you basically called<br/>my friends mentally ill.
Yeah, you think some lame<br/>apology will fix that?
What if I just paint the rest<br/>of the room by myself?
Apology accepted.
Okay, let's do this.
Let-Let's find out<br/>each other's likes and dislikes.
Start with something<br/>totally random.
Like, um, oh, I don't know.
Are you a fan of--<br/>I don't know--
Annie Hall?
I'm guessing that's not random<br/>at all, and you use that movie
to test whether a girl is cool?
No, it's-it's the first movie<br/>that popped into...
I love Annie Hall.<br/>Oh, thank God you're cool.
But just as things started
to go well<br/>with Janet McIntyre...
Whoa. I just found<br/>Janet McIntyre.
The Janet McIntyre.
Sweet... mother... of God!
Uh, well, I got to<br/>run to the restroom.
No internet, Mister.
If you find out my deep, dark<br/>secret, I'll have to kill you.
It's just my friends<br/>checking up on me.
I'll politely let them know<br/>we're having a lovely time.
Okay.
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on<br/>the link, so leave me alone."
And then either texted me a<br/>bunch of symbols for profanity,
or got food poisoning
and dropped the weirdest deuce<br/>of all time.
You guys have<br/>to see this.
No. We're with<br/>Ted on this.
We don't want to<br/>find out about Janet,
just like we don't want to<br/>find out about the baby.
Because we like mystery,
whether it's the hairy<br/>majesty of Bigfoot,
or the bloodsucking ferocity<br/>of the Chupacabra,
or the gender<br/>of our little miracle.
Thanks for putting<br/>those together
in the same<br/>sentence, sweetie.
Mm.
Look, if you guys don't want<br/>to know, how about this?
Let me look,<br/>and I won't tell you.
Absolutely not.<br/>Fine.
Baby, if it will shut him up,
what's the harm?
Can I...?
This may have been a mistake.
Boy!
Do I like babies!
Girl!
...friend,
your hair looks<br/>fantastic!
Twins!
was the feel-good movie of 1988.
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't<br/>matter what you guys say.
We're not gonna cave.
Yes, we are!
Oh, just open<br/>your eyes.
This gender-neutral<br/>yellow is horrible!
We're clearly gonna paint<br/>over the whole thing!
That's what you want to hear.
I gots to know!
Yeah.
"It's a..."
It's a...
Where is the rest<br/>of the card?
I ripped it in half.
I knew you'd be<br/>desperate to see it,
and I'll give it to you.
All you have to do is admit<br/>that mystery is stupid
by reading<br/>about Janet McIntyre.
This is in no way<br/>emotional extortion.
You guys are great.
Fine, we'll look<br/>at your laptop.
Sweet...
mother... of God.
I can't really see<br/>the computer screen.
It just went down<br/>the wrong pipe.
Whoa.
If Lily and Marshall want me<br/>to click on it,
maybe Janet really does have<br/>a deep, dark secret.
What's going on?
I'm a prostitute.
You didn't think I was
actually into you, did you?
Sort of.
Get it together, Mosby.
Oh.
You don't buy beer,<br/>you rent it.
Am I right?
This is the<br/>men's room.
I know.
I'm a dude.
Listen, there's something<br/>you should know.
I lied.
I only kind of liked Annie Hall.
I gots to know!
Sweet...
mother... of God.
Hey.
Ted, are you okay?<br/>You look freaked out.
I'm not freaked out.
I was freaked out. Why?
'Cause I had just discovered<br/>that Janet McIntyre was...
amazing!
And just like that,<br/>the wall went up.
Okay, he looked at<br/>Janet McIntyre's
Internet<br/>extravaganza.
Here's the other half<br/>of the card.
Wait. Should we<br/>do this? I...
I don't know.<br/>I mean, my soul says no,
but these hideous<br/>yellow walls scream yes.
Should I just stop, or...?
Sweet mother of God!
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way<br/>to Saskatoon!
What?
We figured out the Janet thing.
I'm catching up on Canada.
You're with me on this, right?
Otherwise, I can go down,<br/>and I can get the card.
Absolutely.
Oh, thank you.
And so the gender<br/>remained a secret,
but Janet McIntyre's life<br/>no longer was.
There was only one problem.
Ted, what's going on?
Nothing.
Did I mention<br/>that I'm the youngest architect
in New York history<br/>to have a skyscraper built?
Oh.<br/>So, I'm not quite
as far beneath you<br/>as you might think.
Why would I think that?
No reason, but this one time<br/>in sixth grade,
I saw a raccoon trapped<br/>in a gutter, and I told my dad,
and the firemen came<br/>and got it out,
so it's not like I pulled a baby<br/>from a creek or anything,
but at least<br/>I didn't ignore it
and keep lighting bugs on fire<br/>with my magnifying glass.
We had one promise,<br/>and you broke it.
What are you talking about?
You looked me up, and now<br/>you find me intimidating.
Why-Why would I find you<br/>intimidating, okay?
It's not like<br/>I donated a kidney,
but I donated blood once,
although I wound up fainting,
and they had to put it<br/>all back in.
I was so excited about this.
But now you're just a blubbering<br/>idiot like the rest of them.
No, I ain't!
I mean, no, I never do<br/>that thing you says.
What I mean is,<br/>you gooder than me
no make difference!
And that's that.
I wish to God I'd never<br/>clicked on that link.
I'm sorry, Ted.
We were just<br/>trying to help.
I said it was meddling<br/>and manipulative,
but Kevin insisted we butt in.
No, it's my fault.
I never should have looked.
In the battle<br/>of mystery versus history,
it's best<br/>not to know.
Lily Pad?
What?
We're having a boy.
We're having a boy.
We're having a boy!<br/>You're having a boy!
We're having a...<br/>we're having a boy.
We're having a boy.
We're having<br/>a boy.
I'll go buy<br/>some blue paint.
It needs sharpening.
You see? I told you three days<br/>would go by in no time.
Phineas, take us up!
Well, in case<br/>you were wondering,
it rained the entire time<br/>I was in the Caribbean.
Thank you for asking.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the fall of 2011,
all of my friends<br/>were in relationships.
So when Barney's brother James<br/>came to visit,
it created<br/>a slight logistical problem.
We're gonna need a bigger booth.
I'm gonna go<br/>to the loo.
I don't actually<br/>have to go,
I just want a seat<br/>all to myself.
So, would anyone care<br/>to ask me where
Nora and I are<br/>going tonight?
Don't ask him.<br/>It's a trap.
- Where you going?<br/>- Come on, man, for God's sake!
Bootytown, Kevin!
We are finally going<br/>to Bootytown.
And that's why<br/>we don't ask him.
I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on<br/>the Long Thighland Expressway,
stop off for a nibble<br/>in Breastport,
and then, with any luck,
I'll be pulling into<br/>the Pork Authority by midnight.
Wait. You're finally<br/>going to Bootytown?
Look, we just don't want<br/>to rush anything, okay?
So we decided to wait<br/>until she decides
to let me have sex<br/>with her.
And that's<br/>gonna be tonight!
How do you<br/>know for sure?
Ah, something<br/>she said earlier.
Guess what, my sweet boy,
I've got a special treat<br/>for you tonight.
Oh, yeah, you're going<br/>to Bootytown.
Hello again, my darlings.
Barney, I hope you're ready<br/>for tonight.
Because you're gonna have<br/>to use muscles
you haven't used in years.
I am?
Yes.
And I hope you have<br/>some aspirin at home,
because your arse is gonna be<br/>killing you tomorrow.
It is?
Indeed.
Because tonight...
I'm strapping on this.
We're going skating!
The Pork Authority's<br/>closed.
Looks like it's Hand<br/>Central Station
for you, little buddy.
So that's your special treat?
Ice skating?
Of course.
And after that,<br/>we're gonna shag.
We're going ice skating,<br/>everybody!
Ask me what<br/>I think of Nora.
What do you think of Nora?
Lovely girl.
Ask me what<br/>I really think of her.
What do you really<br/>think of her?
Guys, she's great, seriously.
Just drop it.
Ask me one more time.
What do you really think?
Fine! If you really must know,
I do not like Barney<br/>with that woman!
Happy?
What could you possibly<br/>not like about Nora?
Her hair?<br/>Her mousy little nose?
The way she does<br/>everything perfectly?
I mean, what's not to like?
It's not that I don't like her.<br/>It's just...
She's our mom.
What do you mean,<br/>she's your mom?
Everything about her<br/>is vaguely our mom-like.
The British accent...
Hello again, my darlings.
Mom's obsessed<br/>with Julie Andrews,
so when we were growing up...
Hello again, my darlings.
- Come here, you.<br/>- Hey.
And the way she hugs him.
Left hand on the nape<br/>of the neck,
three gentle strokes on<br/>the back with the right?
Come here, you.
Trademark Loretta Stinson.
But here's the clincher...
Guess what, my sweet boy.
Guess what<br/>my sweet boy.
I've got a special treat<br/>for you tonight.
I've got a special<br/>treat for you tonight.
Ice cream!
They're coming.<br/>Be cool.
Forgot my raincoat.
That makes one of us.
Well, shall we?
We shall.
Ooh, don't wear out<br/>that tongue, Barney.
Don't wait up.
I mean, sure, Barney has slept
with plenty<br/>of other people's mothers.
But now he's gonna sleep<br/>with ours?
Psychologically speaking,<br/>it's perfectly normal
to wind up with someone<br/>like your parents.
Thanks to my mom, I'll probably<br/>wind up with someone
who loves my brother<br/>more than me.
Well, psychologically<br/>speaking,
I'm gonna go<br/>throw up now.
Oh...
Ugh! This baby<br/>is making it
so I can't button<br/>my pants anymore.
Big whoop.<br/>In 55 years,
I don't think my dad<br/>buttoned his pants even once.
And somehow, despite<br/>sweet talk like that,
I don't feel sexy anymore.
Are you kidding?
I mean, you're-you're<br/>even sexier now
that you're rounding out.
I mean, you're even<br/>more sexy simply
because there's so<br/>much more of you.
I'm never gonna get<br/>in the mood while
your mammoth Eriksen seed<br/>is muffin-topping
the bodiddly out of me.
Are you saying,<br/>"No erky-erky
until this baby<br/>pops out"?
Okay, that's it.
I-I am making it my mission<br/>to help you feel sexy again.
I don't care how much<br/>more bloated you get.
I'll get the<br/>next round!
Kevin!<br/>Yay, Kevin, thank you!
So, Ted, you're cool
with Kevin, right?
I know he's been<br/>over a lot lately.
Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great.
I mean, there was, like,<br/>one weird thing the other day...
He was just standing<br/>there in his boxers?
Yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Ted...
be honest.
You'd bang Lily, right?
So, later that night,
Barney and Nora went skating.
Hey, kid, you know<br/>how your mom won't
let you have ice cream<br/>till after dinner?
But then the waiting<br/>kind of makes it taste better?
Well, I've been waiting<br/>two months
for that bowl<br/>of ice cream.
And tonight,<br/>I'm gonna have sex with it.
Look, Barney,<br/>one foot!
Oh!
Now, kids, for most guys,
this would have meant<br/>the end of the date.
But your Uncle Barney<br/>is not most guys.
I can turn this around.
Well, I'm impressed<br/>that you know
a 24-hour dentist.
Oh, yeah.
He can also give you tattoos,
do your taxes<br/>and alter a suit.
But I wouldn't trust him<br/>with a suit 'cause...
Speaking of drinking,<br/>you want to...?
No, Barney.
Tonight's been<br/>a disaster.
I think we should just<br/>call it a night.
No! Come on, Nora,
your tooth can't be that bad.<br/>Let me see.
W-Which is the fake one again?
You look beautiful.
Mmm.
All right, maybe I could go<br/>for one more drink.
Great.
It's funny.
Sometimes the most<br/>romantic moments
can just creep up on you...
I can turn this around.
Hey, um,
should've mentioned this before,<br/>but, um, Ted and I prefer
that our guests remain<br/>fully clothed in
the public areas<br/>of the apartment.
Been some complaints.
Did Ted say something?
Oh, th-there's been<br/>some complaints.
Not pointing any fingers<br/>or anything,
but let's just keep<br/>those pants on, okay? Good talk.
Well, if Ted said that,
I've got something to complain<br/>Ted's nuts.
Okay, yes, Ted is a little<br/>neurotic, but I wouldn't say...
No, no, no, I mean Ted's nuts.
Hi.
Hey.
So what? It's his apartment.
You're taking his side?
Wait, this isn't<br/>one of those classic
"You still have feelings<br/>for your ex-boyfriend,
"who's oddly also your roommate,
"which for the record<br/>I'm totally cool with,
"even though everybody<br/>tells me I've walked
into a bear trap" things, is it?
No, I just, I feel bad.
Ted's going through<br/>some stuff right now.
You eyeballing his deal<br/>is the most action
he's gotten in months.
I'll be nice to him.
So, I was trying<br/>to think of how
to best express<br/>how sexy you are to me.
A song? A poem?
a board game!
You just get women.
No, no, no, you'll like this.
We answer risqué questions<br/>and perform spicy dares
to slowly move up<br/>your shapely legs.
I call it Chutes and Lilies.
I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.
Yeah, that would've been better.
Okay, game play.
Roll the die to see<br/>who goes first,
forfeit a turn on a pass--<br/>intended for two-to-six players.
As Marshall explained the many<br/>rules of Chutes and Lilies,
Lily thought back<br/>to what Kevin said in the bar.
It's perfectly normal to wind up<br/>with someone like your parents.
And then she thought of<br/>the only other man she knew
who loved board games<br/>that much.
I brought Diseases!
Marshgammon.
Dog Fight Promoter!
Lilial Pursuit.
And that's how you play<br/>the game.
Oh, wait.
I forgot to tell you<br/>what happens
if I land on "community chest."
Honk-honk.
I just want to go home,
take a long bath<br/>and go to bed.
No!
I mean, come on.
My place is so much closer.
I'll-I'll draw you a bath,
pour you some champagne,<br/>we can forget all about this.
All right,<br/>that sounds good.
That bath was<br/>wonderful.
- Thank you.<br/>- Of course.
What do you say we go<br/>out on the balcony,
get some fresh air?
Ooh, that sounds lovely.
What a beautiful view.
I couldn't agree more.
Good-bye, cruel world!
Oh, my God!
I can turn this around.
Shh.
Ooh!
Ooh! Date night.
You know what? I'll just,<br/>just watch this in my room.
Already had dinner in there,<br/>why not a movie?
You should join us.
Yeah, join us.
No! No, no, no, no, no.<br/>Three's a crowd.
Besides, you guys wouldn't<br/>want to watch this anyway.
Try us.
Well, have you seen Die Hard?
Um, yes.
Okay, the guy who played Argyle
produced this documentary<br/>about coin collecting.
Now, I know my sexy<br/>little lady can't resist
a bubble bath,<br/>especially one
with rose petals.
Oh, thanks, baby.
How about a sensual backrub?
Mm.
- Oh.<br/>- What's the matter, Lilypad?
You love my backrubs.
Ah. I-I do... very much.
Good, because I got you<br/>a brand-
new...
loofah!
Oh, yeah!
Rubs... oh, yeah!
Trying to watch the coin<br/>documentary over here.
Hey, Ted, ever figure out who<br/>you're taking to that concert?
No.
- You want to go?<br/>- Sure.
- Really?<br/>- Awesome!
It's a date!
Now, Kevin,<br/>as a trained psychologist,
knew the appropriate way<br/>to voice his displeasure.
I think we need<br/>to calmly discuss
the relationship dynamics<br/>at play here.
I'm uncomfortable<br/>with how close you two are
as roommates, given your<br/>particular romantic history.
Instead, he took<br/>a different approach.
Aw, hell no!
If you can go on a date<br/>with my girlfriend,
I don't have to wear pants<br/>in your apartment!
I can't wait till<br/>this baby comes out
so we can get started<br/>on another one.
Then again,
why wait?<br/>Ew, wait...
Get off of me!
Damn it!
Ever since Kevin said
it's normal to wind up<br/>with your parents,
I... I keep picturing yo<br/>as my dad.
Lily, that theory is crazy-town.
How do you know?
Because my mother is<br/>six-foot-three,
she buys her clothes<br/>at the drugstore,
and she prefers<br/>to trap her own dinner.
I love you more than anything,
and you're nothing like her.
Aw.
Now, that's how<br/>you turn a girl on.
- Mm...<br/>- Mm...
But then Marshall<br/>really started thinking
about Kevin's theory.
Midnight snack.
Midnight snack.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah...!
I am gonna rock...
your...
world.
Yay.
If it's any consolation,
the, uh... the guy stole my<br/>Wall Street Journal once.
So... guess the world's kind<br/>of a better place without...
Oh, God, this<br/>night's ruined.
Oh, come here, you.
Yes, it's been<br/>a very tough night,

Really?
Why not?
No sense in letting things<br/>get us down.

Mommy, no.
I want to thank you,<br/>baby, for reminding me of
what a vivacious woman I am.
Yeah.
No, uh, no need really.
Whoa, but I've been<br/>such a naughty girl.
Maybe I need a spanking.
Great. We'll...
we'll just skip<br/>the board games
and get right down to me<br/>making love to you.
Oh...
Okay, good, 'cause
I'm gonna ride you<br/>like an unbroken stallion.
Okay.
Giddyup, cowgirl.
No, I can't go<br/>through with this!
Thank God, me neither!
You're too much<br/>like my dad.
You're too much<br/>like my dad.
Your dad?!
Okay, dropping trou--<br/>bad idea.
We're moving on from that.
This guy is a snake.
What?! No.
Ted? He's a nice guy.
A really, really nice guy.
You should be more like him.
Mom, right on schedule.
- What?<br/>- Nothing.
I'm just saying,<br/>you think he's so fragile,
and yet...<br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, fragile?
You think I'm fragile?
Yeah, fragile like a fox.
First, he tries
scaring me off<br/>with his little peep show.
Then he crashes our movie.
Now, he's got tickets to<br/>some super romantic concert.
It's Weird Al Yankovic.
Okay. But still, who's the first<br/>person he asked to go with him?
My girlfriend.
Oh, man. Okay.
You think I'm the first<br/>person Ted asked?
Ted, am I the first person<br/>you asked?
Marshall...!
You, me, Weird Al.
No thanks, Ted.
Barney...!
I got two tickets<br/>to Weird Al Yan...
Barney?
Lily...!
Come on! You'll be<br/>the hottest girl there!
Okay, you'll be<br/>the only girl there.
Stuart...!
Claudia...!
Brad...!
Nat-alie...!
Trudy...!
Ranjit...!
Carl the bartender...!
Dude from my bodega...!
Steam cleaning coupon guy...!
Mom...!
Please? I'll fly you out.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, sweet pea.
Is Clint there?
No.
Wow. You really<br/>are pretty fragile.
Look, I'm trying to explain<br/>to you guys that I'm...
Well, how do you<br/>expect me to feel?!
I mean, all I want
is for someone to go<br/>to a Weird Al concert with me,
and I'm stuck going<br/>with my roommate.
Yeah, I might have to<br/>rain-check you there, buddy.
I'm not a Weird Al fan.
He's just a rip-off<br/>of Peculiar Jacques.
Guess I'm going to<br/>this concert alone.
I'll be that weird guy.
I mean, that<br/>other weird guy.
You know, there is one guy<br/>you didn't ask yet.
Someone who happens to be<br/>the biggest Weird Al fan
in the whole world.
Kevin...?
Ted...!
Oh! Oh, you are gonna flip<br/>when you see our tickets.
They're in the shape<br/>of an accordion.
What?!
So, uh, you<br/>like Weird Al?
Not in the slightest.
No, dude, I'm the biggest<br/>Weird Al fan.
I know,<br/>I'm agreeing with you.
Do you know that I gave him the<br/>idea for "Like a Surgeon." Yeah.
Yeah. I wrote him a fan letter,<br/>and then a few months later...
Bam!<br/>Top of the charts!
You guys can eat it.
Just... eat it.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
How'd it go with Nora?
Well, among other things,
I realized<br/>Nora's a lot like my mom.
I'll bet that<br/>ruined things, huh?
Come on. Barney Stinson<br/>always turns it around.
- How?<br/>- Simple.
I turned...<br/>it... around.
Oh...<br/>Uh-huh? Uh-huh?
So the mom thing wasn't<br/>a total deal breaker, huh?
No!
Guys, my mom is<br/>the best person I know.
If Nora's even the tiniest bit<br/>like her, I'm a lucky guy.
Hey, you know what?
I'm a real lucky guy.
'Cause I married my dad.
Aw.
So, uh, you want<br/>to go get luckier?
Bye, guys.
See ya.
So, what should<br/>we do now?
"We" should do nothing.
You guys get out of here,<br/>go watch your movie.
I'm fine. Really.
- You sure?<br/>- Yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
Uh, hey... hey, Kevin.
I think I'm a clone now.
I'm sorry.
Were you just quoting Weird Al?
I was indeed.
I'm a huge Weird Al fan.
Well, then I need<br/>to buy you a drink.
I'll have a glass of champagne,<br/>sweet pea.
One glass of champa--
Sweet pea?
Sure. Meeting<br/>a fellow Weird Al fan?
That's cause<br/>for celebration.
Bottle of bubbly,<br/>coming right up!
"Dear Mr. Yankovic,
"my name is Ted Mosby...
"eight years old...
'Eat It' changed my life..."
Blah, blah, blah.
Uhp. Here we go.
"I have some ideas<br/>for new songs you could do."
Why can't they just<br/>leave me alone?!
"Wake Me Up Before You Pogo."
Spend a whole afternoon<br/>on that one?
"Like a Surgeon."

[<div class="full-script">Kids, for years, your Uncle Barney
had reveled in mocking<br/>Aunt Robin's Canadian heritage.
To have to grow up<br/>in Canada...
with America right there.
It's like an entire country<br/>without a tailor.
Why? Why do we let<br/>you be a country?!
But all that was about<br/>to change.
I was on Facebook.
Nobody cool's<br/>on Facebook anymore.
Well, you know who is<br/>on Facebook now?
Everybody's parents.
And I just happen<br/>to be friends
with Barney's long-lost father,
Mr. Jerome Whitaker.<br/>- Me, too.
He's gotten really good<br/>at Bejeweled Blitz.
And guess who thought my status<br/>update about Manitoba was
so interesting because his<br/>mother was born in Manitoba?
What?
Which means your grandmother...
No...
Which makes you...
Don't say it!
...one-quarter Canadian!
Welcome to the tribe, hoser!
No...
it's not true!
That's impossible!
Once upon a time<br/>at a Halloween party,
I met a girl<br/>dressed like a pumpkin...
a slutty pumpkin.
And she was extraordinary.
But she gave me her number<br/>on a Kit Kat bar,
which was tragically given away<br/>as Halloween candy.
So every year I return<br/>to that same party
hoping I'd see her again.
But with every passing October,<br/>that hope grew a little dimmer.
Then one day, after ten years<br/>of searching...
Oh, my God.
The slutty pumpkin.
This might sound creepy,<br/>but do you have a record
of who rented it in 2001?
Wow, that was easy.
You're not the first lovelorn<br/>young man
to walk through that door.
Three girls got proposals off
my wife's slutty artichoke<br/>costume.
Two others disappeared,<br/>but I focus on the positive.
I couldn't believe it.<br/>I actually had her address.
I knew I had<br/>to play this right.
It's not like I could just walk<br/>up and knock on her door.
Hi, you probably<br/>don't remember me, but...
Halloween, ten years ago.
Now that's a slow play.
The next day,<br/>Lily and Marshall headed out
to Lily's grandparents<br/>for dinner.
Marshall loved it<br/>out in the 'burbs.
Look how many fireflies<br/>I caught!
Don't forget to poke holes<br/>in the jar this time.
Now we have<br/>a nice surprise for you.
Whatever it is,<br/>we're saying no.
- What?<br/>- You know what.
Every time we're here,
my grandparents stick us with<br/>some big old piece of junk
they're getting rid of.
It's like the world's worst<br/>Showcase Showdown.
It's a perfectly<br/>usable lawnmower!
We live in an apartment!
But maybe someday
when we move to the suburbs...
We're never moving<br/>to the suburbs!
And you also get...
this skinny microphone!
Oh!
Before we head out<br/>to our place in Florida,
we wanted to give<br/>our favorite granddaughter
a little something.
Ooh, it's so small.<br/>I love it!
- A key?<br/>- We're giving you the house.
Lily, I know you've<br/>always hated the suburbs...
We'll take it!
For my first date<br/>with the slutty pumpkin,
I took her someplace special.
Ted, this is so romantic.
The spot where<br/>we first met
ten years ago.
Do you remember the song<br/>that was playing that night?
I remember how beautiful<br/>you looked.
♪ It's been one week<br/>since you looked at me ♪
♪ Cocked your head to the side<br/>and said, "I'm angry." ♪
Is that, uh,<br/>the Barenaked Ladies, huh?
♪ Five days since you laughed<br/>at me ♪
♪ Saying, "Get that together.<br/>Come back and see me." ♪
Kids, it took me ten years,<br/>but I finally kissed her.
And it was... terrible.
Lily, you hate the suburbs.
I know, but my grandparents<br/>giving us a house
right when<br/>the baby's on the way?
It's perfect timing.
This is great.<br/>I'm finally gonna be able
to barbecue with<br/>proper ventilation.
Marshall!
We're moving<br/>to the suburbs, baby!
Oh...
Okay.
Baby, you're not moving<br/>to the suburbs.
Why not?
Lily is only agreeing
to all this because<br/>of Pregnancy Brain.
Pregnancy Brain?<br/>That's not a thing.
It's totally a thing.
Her brain is marinating in<br/>a cocktail of hormones,
mood swings and jacked-up<br/>nesting instincts.
I mean, yes, right now<br/>Lily is a goddess
bestowing the<br/>miracle of life,
but damn, she dumb!
Well, I have noticed some stuff.
I can't find my keys<br/>or wallet anywhere!
I found them...
here in the freezer.
Hey, but where are<br/>the ice cube trays?
No idea.
Those poor ice cubes!
I guess she has been<br/>a little off lately.
A little? She just texted me
wanting directions back<br/>from the bathroom.
Oh. We're over here!
You're doing great, sweetie!
That moron should not be making<br/>big life decisions right now.
If you let her move<br/>to the suburbs,
it would be like taking<br/>advantage
of a helpless drunk chick.
What? Where?!
Oh, I got a girlfriend, right.
Baby, we should put<br/>off moving.
Why?
Because I think<br/>the pregnancy is
affecting your judgment.
No, Marshall, this is<br/>an amazing opportunity
that we have<br/>to take advantage of!
Just because my body<br/>is growing a fungus...
Fetus.
...doesn't mean that my metal<br/>factories...
Mental faculties.
...are in any way funicular.
No idea.
Mmm...
This is nice.<br/>What is this?
Canadian whiskey.
I want scotch!
American scotch<br/>from Scotland!
Get that swill<br/>away from me!
Why are you doing<br/>this to me?
You have been ripping<br/>on Canada
since Justin Bieber was<br/>knee-high to a snow blower.
So now this Canuck's<br/>gonna beat on you
like the drummer from Yukon<br/>Blonde hopped up on Timbits.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey!
How was your
big date with<br/>the Snuffy Tuffkin?
The Sniffy Napkin?
The Slouchy Foreskin?
Lily tie-tie.
It was good... ish.
Look, there's Orion's Belt.
Oh.
Why does holding hands feel<br/>this weird?
Should our fingers<br/>not intertwine?
What's causing that<br/>pinching feeling?
I'll just cup her hand.
There. That's...
not great.
Her hair's up my nose.
Her shoulder's jabbing<br/>into my windpipe.
Maybe if we reposition.
I have to say something.
She must be feeling it, too.
This feels so right.
We fit like two puzzle pieces.
Yeah.
Ted, I know you've waited<br/>ten years for this girl,
but some things<br/>just aren't meant to be.
Not so fast.<br/>At the end of the night,
when I leaned in and somehow<br/>accidentally kissed
her open eyeball, there was a<br/>slight flicker of something
I might even call chemistry...
adjacent.
Thank you.
Wait.
Where is my cash?
Oh, yeah,
I did a little exchange<br/>for ya, Canucklehead.
This Canadian dollar here<br/>is called a "loonie."
And this two-dollar coin?<br/>A "toonie." True story.
It's federal currency<br/>and you people talk about it
like it's a Hannah-<br/>Barbera character.
Not you people, Barney.
Our people.
Even though my first date<br/>with Naomi was
a little awkward,
our second date was<br/>a lot awkward.
Mmm...!
This is the worst<br/>kissing of all time!
Mmm...
How could she possibly<br/>be into this?
She sounds like<br/>those cows in
Temple Grandin's<br/>hug machines.
Do you want to listen<br/>to some music?
Uh-huh!
Ted, this is our song.
Let's make love to this song.
♪ Chickety China,<br/>the Chinese chicken ♪
♪ Have a drumstick<br/>and your brain stops tickin' ♪
Yeah, I just gotta run<br/>to the bathroom.
♪ X-Files with no lights on,<br/>we're dans la maison. ♪
Hey, doofus!
It's me:<br/>you at age 15.
And we made a deal
we would always boink any chick<br/>that wants to boink us!
Yes, she's beautiful,
it's just there's<br/>no connection there.
I don't feel intimate with her.
"Intimate"? Let me remind you<br/>of some things
you did feel "intimate" with<br/>when you were 15:
a catcher's mitt,
an oven mitt,<br/>a glass of warm water,
a half-open hide-a-bed sofa,<br/>a top-loading VCR!
It's not gonna happen!
Come on!
It'll take, like, 30 seconds!
Naomi, listen...
Shh...
You like that, Ted?
Hmm.
Do you ike it<br/>when I caress your hair?
Your hair is<br/>so nice to caress.
Why is she saying that word?
I like to caress your hair.
There it is again! "Caress!"<br/>Who says that?
Caress.
The thing is,<br/>I like her, okay?
I really, really like her.
I just don't seem to like<br/>anything she says or does.
I have to break up<br/>with her, don't I?
Yes!
After you sleep with her, yes!
Marshall, I've been thinking<br/>about what you said.
You're right, we shouldn't<br/>move to the suburbs.
Let's not make any huge life<br/>decisions right now.
Is this because you tried<br/>to make waffles
with the laptop this morning?
Anyway, I'm gonna call<br/>a real estate broker
to come look at the<br/>house tomorrow.
Oh, by the way,
I ordered those Minnesota<br/>Vikings drapes.
You're right, they're totally<br/>gonna class up our apartment.
Okay, yes. It's wrong<br/>to bang a drunk chick.
But you're an idiot if you don't<br/>get, like, a little something.
Yo, Canada.
What? Dammit!
Ha, you answer to "Canada" now.
I'll make you a deal.
You wear this costume
to the Halloween party<br/>tomorrow night,
I'll drop it forever.
You can't be serious.
Oh, I am as serious<br/>as a poutine shortage
in Chicoutimi during<br/>a curling bonspiel.
I don't know what<br/>any of those words mean.
Yes. You do.
Oh, that must be the broker.<br/>Marshall, will you get it?
Sure. Of course.
Trick or treat!
Oh, my gosh. How cute!
I'm sorry, we don't<br/>have any candy.
Um, we forgot about<br/>trick-or-treaters.
We don't get any where we live.
Yup. Only get this<br/>kind of cuteness
in the suburbs.
Oh. Look at how sweet and<br/>happy and unarmed they all are!
Are you using adorable<br/>little children in costumes
to manipulate me?<br/>- Bye!
I mean, did you even call<br/>a real estate broker?
No.
I've got Pregnancy Brain<br/>like a fiddle
and I've been playing<br/>you like a fox.
♪ Oh, Canada... ♪
♪ Our home and native land... ♪
I knew it would be tough<br/>to break up with Naomi.
But when it's just not there,<br/>you can't force it.
Happy Halloween.
And just like that, I was<br/>taken back ten years...
to the hopeful kid in<br/>the hanging chad costume,
falling head over heels<br/>for the Slutty Pumpkin.
I made you something.
- Oh.<br/>- Your costume from that first night.
Although you do realize<br/>that even ten years ago,
the hanging chad reference<br/>was like almost a year old.
Wow...
I can't believe you made this.
I can't believe you found me.
Stay strong, Teddy.<br/>We can do this.
I...
"Have to break up with you,"<br/>just say it.
Love...<br/>Wait, what?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Say sunsets!<br/>Pancakes! Anything!
Just don't say...
You.
No!
Barney? Where are you?
You're moving slower<br/>than John Diefenbaker
climbing Mount Hungabee<br/>on Boxing Day.
Those are all real references<br/>to our shared homeland.
I'll be right there.
Can't wait to see you in your<br/>costume, Dudley Do-Right.

Anywhere.
Upstairs, downstairs...

Lily, I want to be<br/>inside this house so bad.
USA! USA!
USA!
Come on!
Okay, so rather than<br/>wearing a Mountie costume
and end this forever,
you show up shirtless<br/>to an outdoor party?
It's practically November.
No biggie. I ain't cold.
Huh. Interesting.
It's fascinating.
Almost as if your body was<br/>accustomed to low temperatures
after generations of adapting.
Canada.
No.
Guys, hey. Robin,<br/>Barney, this is Naomi.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
Nice to meet you guys.
I'm gonna go make some Tootsie<br/>Rolls. It's a drink I invented.
There's a song and dance
that goes along with it,<br/>but I have to
drink three of them<br/>before I can do it.
Oh.<br/>Okay. You go.
This way.
Sounds delicious.<br/>In theory.
But you never know<br/>until you taste it.
Ted... have you tasted<br/>her Tootsie Roll?
Of course not.
- Ow.<br/>- Wait. Have you?
You had sex with someone you<br/>have zero feelings for!
U-S-A!
U-S...
Stop it.
Just no part of it felt right.
At first there was too much<br/>eye contact, then not enough.
Where do you look during sex?
Um, into the hidden camera<br/>at future me watching it.
Okay. Wait. How does
saying "I want to break up<br/>with you" lead into sex?
I didn't say "I want to<br/>break up with you," exactly.
What did you say, exactly?
"I love you."
Classic Schmosby.
Marshall, this house<br/>wants you so bad.
"Mow my lawn.
"Rake my leaves.
Winterize my pipes""
Yes!
Yes! I'm coming...
to terms with this decision!
Oh!
Trick or treat!
Yay!
Okay.
Oh.
Happy Halloween.
- Lily.<br/>- Yeah?
You just gave<br/>those children
a stapler,<br/>a pair of sharp scissors,
and a pretty decent<br/>Pinot Noir.
I did?
Oh, my God.
I'm going to miss<br/>that stapler so much.
I'm not doing<br/>so great, am I?
Maybe not.
We shouldn't make any<br/>huge life decisions
right now, should we?
Hey, look, I love you and<br/>I-I love the idea of raising
our kids with a lawn<br/>and a white picket fence,
but we have our whole lives<br/>to decide when
and if we want<br/>to do that.
Do what?
Let's get you home.
Ooh.
That's for the stapler!
I hate the suburbs.
Naomi...
We have to<br/>end this.
W-- huh?
I'm sorry, Tootsie Rolls make me
really honest.
Ted... I know<br/>you're super into me.
But we are terrible together.
Wait, what?
I've been trying, saying things<br/>felt good that didn't just to...
I thought saying it was good<br/>would make it feel good, but...
...it always felt off.
Why won't he stop<br/>sniffing my hair?
And what's up<br/>with the hand holding?
It's like he's trying<br/>to win a thumb war.
Ted, this is our song.
Oh, no, he thinks<br/>I'm actually into this song.
Does he not get sarcasm?
Let's make love to this song.
I'll just be even more<br/>ridiculous
to make it clear it's a joke.
♪ Chickety-China,<br/>the Chinese chicken... ♪
I...
Uh-oh, where you going<br/>with this, buddy?
...love...
Nope, too soon.
Say basset hounds,<br/>Pretzel Crisps, anything but...

Oh, God, just kiss him<br/>before he proposes.
Ted, I've been looking<br/>for the Hot Hanging Chad
for the last nine Halloweens.
I've waded<br/>through a sweaty parade
of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters,
Antoine Dodsons,<br/>and that jackass
who always dresses as laundry.
Oh, I hate that guy.
That's why,<br/>once I finally found you...
...it was hard to let you go.
Good-bye, Ted.
Let's just not touch ever again.
Probably a good idea, yeah.
Okay.
Kids, after spending a decade<br/>dreaming of the wrong girl,
I wanted more than ever<br/>for the next woman I met
to be the real thing.
Yeah, I don't know, Barney,<br/>she doesn't seem like my type.
I will kill you.
I'll see<br/>what I can do.
Oh, hey there, I'm<br/>Barney, how are you?
No, I'm Barney.
Whoa.
You pack quite a wallop there.
Hope you didn't<br/>hurt your hand.
Why are you so nice?
Oh, sorry about my<br/>thick noodle there.
How about we split the<br/>cost of the vase, eh?
Holy Zamboni.
Wow, you really put your<br/>weight behind that one.
That was a<br/>really good one.
Oh, heavens to Gretzky, that<br/>was a real Chiclet rattler.

Psst. In here!
I'm safe.<br/>Not quite.
The amulet, please,<br/>Mr. Stinson.
Why?
Help! Help!<br/>The kid.

Grab my tie.
But you're not supposed<br/>to take the tie off.
You lost a bet with your<br/>friends Lily and Marshall
which requires you to wear<br/>the tie for a full year.
If it means saving your life,<br/>I think they'll understand!
They sound like nice people!
Yeah, they are.

That's it.

How can I repay you?
You can stay in school,<br/>that's how.

the heck out of<br/>that ducky tie. I really am.
Look what I just found<br/>in the trash.
No!
Kids, you haven't truly<br/>lived until somewhere,
somebody puts a sign up because<br/>of something you did.
For instance...
Have you guys seen that sign<br/>out front that says
"Absolutely No<br/>Boogie-Boarding"?
What's that all about?
Oh, that's a great story.<br/>You got time for it?
Well, I'm supposed to go to<br/>my mom's birthday party, so...
please make it as<br/>long as you can.
Well, it happened<br/>a few months ago.
The night of the hurricane...
Kids, it was August 26, 2011,
and Hurricane Irene was<br/>barreling towards New York.
Guys, guys, guys.
This storm is serious.
Luckily, you are friends<br/>with a former Boy Scout.
And a Boy Scout is always what?
Unpopular?<br/>Beaten up?
Going to the movies<br/>with his mom?
A Boy Scout is always prepared.
Prepared to spend lunch<br/>in his locker?
Prepared to die a virgin?
Prepared to paint<br/>his sister's nails?
Prepared for emergencies!
That's why a week ago,
when Irene was just<br/>a tropical depression-
You're a tropical depression.
This guy got us...
a disaster backpack,
and a rental car that seats<br/>five, parked right outside.
We're gonna drive up<br/>to my place in Westchester
where we'll all be safe.
Boy Scouted!<br/>You're welcome.
Ted's right, we should go.
Hey, on the way out of the city,
do you mind if we stop at my<br/>place so I can get something?
Okay, what did you have to get?
My drink on.<br/>We're not going anywhere.
What? No!
We don't have time for this!<br/>We gotta get going!
Ted, I'm older than you.<br/>Yeah.
And taller.<br/>Just older.
And when you reach my age,<br/>and height,
you'll see that things like this<br/>hurricane are no big deal.
They're going to close<br/>the bridges.
You guys, we got<br/>to get out of here.
I'm afraid I'm with<br/>blondie on this one.
This storm is nothing.<br/>I'm from Vancouver.
You know what we call<br/>this in the Couv?
Barbecue weather.
Yeah, I'm with these guys.
Drinking beer in front<br/>of Barney's giant TV
beats sitting in the car
listening to<br/>Memoires of a Geisha.
Come on, we're at the best part.
Oh, it's my mom,<br/>checking to see if I'm okay.
Hey, Mom.
Ooh, Mommy!<br/>It's drizzling out!
I'm so scared!
Bikini weather.
Marshall, you're with me, right?
Sorry, old friend.
But I can't afford<br/>to tempt fate.
Oh right, I was being<br/>really weird.
I should explain.
Last summer I quit my job.
And then, a week before<br/>the hurricane...
Huh, my medical<br/>insurance just expired.
That gives me two uninsured weeks<br/>before I'm added to your plan.
It's no biggie.
Ow!<br/>Paper cut.
Death is all around us.
So for the next two weeks
he was basically a really<br/>clingy Edgar Allan Poe.
The Grim Reaper beckons.
I feel his icy grip<br/>around my throat,
the breath of his hounds<br/>at my heels,
the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of<br/>his scythe on my chamber door.
And you, with your<br/>blithe request,
you only hasten<br/>his inevitable triumph.
Is that what you desire?
Is that what you desire, Lily?
I just wanted you<br/>to get us some bagels.
Bagels?!
Do you have any idea
what could happen to me<br/>whilst getting bagels?!
What the...?!<br/>No, not like this!
Fine. I'll go get the bagels.
No!
Why not?
And remember, not too<br/>much cream cheese.
Half a shmear, max.
Thanks, baby.
No! No! Not like this!
Okay, now you're just<br/>being ridiculous.
Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!
People get run over by buses
and hit in the nuts by<br/>skateboards, bitten by babies.
Nobody wakes up and says,<br/>"Today I'm gonna star
in a YouTube video."
You've said that at<br/>least a dozen times.
Lily, for the next two weeks
you must be by my side<br/>protecting me.
Why, what's gonna happen?
Answer: a hurricane.
Just let me take off the tie!<br/>Please!
I have to wear this at work.
Do you have any idea<br/>what that's like?
If the SEC pursues charges,<br/>it's going to be all our asses.
Nobody takes this<br/>more seriously than I do.
Please, can I take it off?
You... may... knot.
With a "K."
A little tie pun.
This is far from over.
You have a price, Eriksen,<br/>and I will find it.
When the end of day is nigh,<br/>I'll have taken off this tie.
I'm going to like the way<br/>I look, I guarantee it.
So boogie-boarding...
Boogie-boarding. So I was trying<br/>to get these guys to leave.
Hey, Nerdlinger,
what's with the safety boner?
I mean, come on.
The disaster kit, the car,<br/>the ladies' rain boots-
Uh, they're men's.
Pink is just easier to<br/>spot from the rescue chopper.
Look, forgive me for caring<br/>about you guys,
but you're my best friends<br/>in the world
and I just want to make sure<br/>you're okay.
Ah. Ted, you are<br/>a giant whining bummer.
Barney...
Come on, Ted,
this storm is not a big deal.
This storm is a big deal.
Let's replay<br/>that harrowing footage
of Irene touching<br/>down in North Carolina.
We gotta get out of here!
Go, go! Come on,<br/>come on!
Please let me take it off!<br/>No.
$5,000?<br/>No.
Is he serious?
$10,000?
No.<br/>Dudes, take the money.
$20,000?<br/>No.
Yes. I'll let you slap me in the face
as hard as you can.<br/>You have my attention.
Kids, you remember Marshall<br/>and Barney's slap bet.
A few years earlier,<br/>Barney lost a bet to Marshall.
His penalty was five slaps<br/>delivered anyplace, anytime.
So far, Marshall had slapped<br/>Barney four times.
Which meant he only had<br/>one slap left.
What do you say, Marshall?
Are you going to seize<br/>this slap-ortunity
or let it slap<br/>through your fingers?
Don't let him<br/>tempt you, Marshall.
I don't know, Lily. I mean<br/>we have a baby on the way.
An extra slap could<br/>really come in handy.
No! No!
This is crazy.
You having to wear that tie<br/>for another ten months
is all the satisfaction I need.
Plus,
I still have one slap left,
and that feels good. But if<br/>you didn't have that slap left-
if say, I were to get you<br/>to slap me tonight-
I suppose that<br/>would change everything.
I suppose it would.
Le jeu commence.
Je m'appelle Marshall.
So boogie-boarding...<br/>Boogie-boarding.
So I was trying to get<br/>these guys to leave,
but there was<br/>one little problem.
Come on, let's go.
I'm staying.
What?!<br/>Barney?!
Hey, hey, it's going to get<br/>pretty crazy out there.
And if some hot woman gets<br/>all her clothes blown off,
and I'm not up here<br/>to videotape it
and put it up on the Internet,<br/>who will, FEMA?
Come on, open your eyes.
No, no, you are coming with us.
We leave no man behind.
Hey, Mom.
Uh, yeah, the boots<br/>were a big hit.
You know, I better pee.
But when Lily and I get back,<br/>we're all leaving.
Wait, I have to go<br/>pee with you?
You want me to go<br/>to the "bathroom,"
the most dangerous room<br/>in the house by myself?
Do you have any idea<br/>what could happen?
Ow! My eye!
I'm blind!
No, no!<br/>Not like this!
I don't think<br/>we're seeing eye to eye
about the likelihood<br/>of that happening.
Hey, it's my dad.
My dad's calling me.
Hey, do you know where...?<br/>Ted got his boots?
Yeah. They're fabulous.<br/>I totally want a pair.
Okay, Dad, I will. Thanks.
Guys, Dad says this hurricane is<br/>a bigger deal than you thought.
I'm taking charge.<br/>We are getting out of here.
Okay, what is with<br/>everybody's parents calling
to check up on them?
It's just a little rain.
Lawn-mowing weather.
Bocce weather.
Wow. You're really bummed
that your dad's<br/>not worried about you.
What?!
Eh... What would my<br/>dad be worried about?
That I'm not wearing<br/>enough sunblock?
House-painting weather.
Ted, you're back.
I've changed my mind.<br/>I'm in. Let's go.
Yeah, I changed my mind, too.<br/>You can't come.
Everybody else,<br/>we're moving out.
That's harsh.
You know what else is harsh?<br/>Ultraviolet light.
I fell asleep in the tanning bed<br/>this week
and I think I got a sunburn<br/>on my cheek.
It's so sensitive.
It's like a big, red bull's-eye.
Ouchie.
Did you take my blush<br/>out of my purse?
So, boogie-boarding.
Boogie-boarding.
Oh, come on, Ted,
you can't just leave him here.
Uh, yeah, I can.
You called me a giant<br/>whining bummer.
You're not allowed in my car.
You don't get to find out<br/>if the geisha finds love.
This is about principle.
Hey, Ted.<br/>I'm ready to go.
And you must be "Principle."
Ah, on a separate note,<br/>guys, this is Maya.
I just met her out in the hall.
We have a lot in common,
such as our mutual love<br/>of country music,
NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy.<br/>Just go with it.
She needed a ride<br/>out of the city,
and we have an extra seat<br/>in the car, so...
Okay, let's hit it!
Wow.
It's come to this.
You could help a friend,
but instead, you're choosing<br/>the hot girl in
the tight tank top.
Your training is complete!
I'm so proud of this kid!
But seriously,<br/>the storm's coming in,
so dump the hoochie<br/>and wheels up.
You promised me a seat.
Oh, for God's sake.
You two both go.<br/>I'll stay here.
What? Lily, no!<br/>Shotgun!
You're staying. Then<br/>Lily can come! Wha...?
No, no, no, I'll stay here.<br/>Why?
I just want<br/>some time away from you!
What?
Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you,
but I haven't had a second alone<br/>in weeks!
It's summer vacation!
All I want to do is<br/>sit in the bathtub
and read a book, but now...
Baby, I forgot to bring a book.
Do you mind reading<br/>yours out loud?
Hey, it's been no picnic<br/>for me either.
You don't even do the voices.
Blocked number.
Hello?
RJ? It's your father.
Daddy?
I love you.
It means so much<br/>that you called.
Ha! I knew that you<br/>wanted him to call. Busted!
That was you?
I really think<br/>you should slap him.
You should slap him!
Slap him.<br/>Slap him.
Two cheeks, no waiting.
Good, 'cause I really<br/>think I'm gonna slap him!
So, boog -boarding?
Boogie-boarding.
Come on, Ted.
You're gonna give some<br/>random floozy a ride,
but not take Barney?
Floozy?!
If she's going, I'm not going!
Lily, you're staying.<br/>Let's go.
If Lily's staying,<br/>then I'm staying!
Then I'm going.<br/>Then I'm going.
You can't go, Marshall,<br/>'cause I'm going.
If Barney's going, I'm<br/>not going! Then I can go.
Then I'm staying.<br/>Then I'm staying.
Then I'm going.
Then I'm not going.
Okay, you know what?<br/>I'm going.
This storm's been on Doppler<br/>radar for a week.
I'm the only one<br/>who prepared for it.
And you all made fun of me.<br/>So guess what?
This Boy Scout<br/>is taking a hike. Good-bye!
Maya, real quick, did you think<br/>there was anything here, or...
Oh, I have a boyfriend.
Good-bye!
Um, Ted...?
The time for evacuation is over.
Everyone should now go inside<br/>and be prepared
to stay inside until weather<br/>conditions improve,
which won't likely be<br/>until Sunday afternoon.
We're stuck here?
Okay, let's not panic.
You know what?<br/>Let's panic.
Hey, if we don't make it<br/>through the night,
I want you guys to know,<br/>and I really mean this...
I wish I had branched out<br/>and made more friends in my 20s.
Well,
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
By myself, I guess.
Watch out for bears.
Since this might be the end,<br/>I gotta confess something.
Can I?
Might as well.
Barney and I have been doing<br/>the wild thing...
this whole time.
Except a brief period last year<br/>when he was shacking up
with Marshall's mom.
But luckily, three-ways<br/>were on the menu, so...
Marshall, you know she didn't<br/>say any of that, right?
I know, but I just want<br/>to slap him so bad!
But that tie is so stupid!<br/>But the slap would feel so good!
But he hates that tie so much!
Perhaps I can help.
Marshall, ask yourself this<br/>question: why today?
He hasn't said anything about<br/>that tie for weeks,
and yet, suddenly today,
he can't wear it another second?
No, there's a reason.
You've got something coming up.
Something where you're
on display, vulnerable...
exposed.
It's not work-related.
No, this is relationship stuff.
You're trying<br/>to impress someone.
In the lie you told,
you said you were being chased<br/>by two goons.
So it's two people.
A couple, perhaps.
You're meeting<br/>Nora's parents tomorrow!
Wrong!
Wrong, wrong, wrong,<br/>wrong, wrong!
It's in two days, and I really<br/>want them to like me!
Oh-ho!<br/>Therapisted!
Shrinked? Shrunk?
We'll figure it out.
So, boogie-boarding.
Boogie-boarding.
Hey, Lily, can I talk<br/>to you for just a second?
Come here.
Marshall, if I'm in here to<br/>brush your teeth, I swear to...
I'm sorry<br/>that I've been so needy lately.
I know that you need<br/>some time alone.
So... I'll be in<br/>the other room.
You're not going anywhere.
Mmm...<br/>Hey...
And the funny thing is,
after that night,<br/>we'll never be alone again.
You made that in my bathroom?
Whoops.
Wow, a hurricane baby.
Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would<br/>be a sweet name.
It would be a crazy sweet name!
Thanks, Ted.
Anyway, the next day,<br/>after the danger had passed...
It's closed.
Now what?
A Boy Scout is always prepared.
Hey!
Nice!
To surviving the hurricane.
Yay!
I love you guys.<br/>Love you.
I did finally make it up here<br/>to the house later that week
only to find that<br/>a falling oak tree had
landed in the living room.
If we'd been here, it would<br/>have crushed us like bugs.
You see, kids, there's no way<br/>of knowing for sure
where the safest place is...
so the best you can hope for is<br/>to have some good company.
Guys, how far do you think I can<br/>boogie-board on this thing?
So far!
Marshall, your insurance doesn't<br/>kick in till tomorrow.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Life kicks in right now.
? ?
Don't worry, he wasn't hurt...
the first time.<br/>I have splints!
The second time he went through<br/>the front window of Maclaren's.
Hence the<br/>"No Boogie-boarding" sign.
All right, guys, I gotta go.
Barney, good luck<br/>with Nora's parents.
Bye.<br/>Bye.
See you later.
All right. See you.<br/>See ya.
Hey, Barney?
Hmm?
Listen, um, we made a baby
in your bathroom.
So we owe you one.
So we say...
you can take off the ducky tie.
For three slaps.
Three slaps?
And to be clear,<br/>this would add three slaps
to Marshall's existing one,<br/>giving him four slaps in total.
Deal.
I'm free!
God, this feels so good!
This was a mistake!
I wanna put the tie back on!
I wanna put the tie back on!
Why do I have to be<br/>Barney right now?
Three slaps remaining!
Three slaps. Wow,<br/>I like the sound of that.
I think I'll save<br/>those bad boys,
you know, for a rainy day.
Okay.<br/>The worst is over.
Ah!
Two slaps remaining!
It's all right.
Hey, it's all done...
for now.
I think I need to go home
and reevaluate how<br/>I make life decisions.
Come on. I have<br/>to go back to work.
Let's split a cab. Okay. Yeah.
Did you ever tell those guys<br/>about that other thing
that almost happened?
That other thing?
Oh, that. No. Did you?
No.
Hey, I'm really sorry<br/>about that phone call.
Oh, it's fine.
No, it is so not fine.<br/>I was a jerk.
And if you don't mind my<br/>saying, your dad is
a complete idiot<br/>for not calling.
He should never let a day go by<br/>without calling you
because when I let a day go by<br/>without talking to you...
Um, that day's just no good.
Um, sorry.
Um...
It's my dad.
Wait, show me your hands.
My hands.
Hey, Dad!
That's what I've been saying!
Golf weather!
Can you believe we almost...?
I know.
Good thing we didn't.
Yeah. I mean, not<br/>long after that
you got together with Nora.
And you met Kevin.
Yeah.<br/>Disaster averted.
Exactly.
It would've ruined everything<br/>if we'd been all...
ah-la-la-la...
I know, right?<br/>So dumb...
La-la-la-la-la-la...
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, Einstein was right.
Time moves at different speeds.
To Barney, the previous night<br/>raced by in a blur.
But then, all of a sudden,
time stopped.
This might be the worst<br/>thing I've ever done.
Hey, now,
you weren't at the top of your<br/>game, but it was still pretty...
Oh, my God!
I just cheated<br/>on Kevin.
He is the nicest guy ever.
I'm a terrible person.
It's okay.
We both cheated.
What's that saying about<br/>two wrongs making a right?
"Two wrongs don't make a right"?
No, that's not it.
Oh, my God.
I just cheated on Nora.
How could I do this to her?<br/>What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Well...
Can I ask you, did<br/>this mean anything?
Of course it did.
Of course it didn't.
Which one are you looking for?<br/>I could see it going either way.
It meant nothing.<br/>It meant nothing!
How could you say<br/>it meant nothing?!
Of course it meant something!
No, it didn't! It can't.
Okay? You're with Nora,<br/>and I'm with Kevin and...
I have to go.
Wait, what are<br/>we gonna tell them?
Nothing.
God! We made a<br/>horrible mistake.
But it-it is over now.
There's no reason to hurt more<br/>people by talking about it.
You're asking me to lie?
That's... fine.
Damn it.
Nora and I have that work cruise<br/>tomorrow night.
We're all supposed<br/>to go together.
Okay, I know this is thinking<br/>way, way out of the box,
but what if-- and hear me out--
we don't go?
No.
I just want this whole night<br/>to fade into history,
so we have to act like<br/>it never happened.
We should go.
I mean, it's a three-hour<br/>boat ride--
what could happen?
I'm sure that's what Gilligan.
Groovapalooza!
All the smug hippie bands from<br/>the '90s in one big concert
Ah, even the tickets
smell like cloves<br/>and mediocrity.
Ah, to really<br/>take us back,
I scored us bag<br/>of, yes, mari...
Kids, we used to do something<br/>before concerts
to enjoy them more.
And that thing was to...<br/>eat a sandwich.
...nated steak subs.
Oh, yeah!
Well, as future parents,<br/>we'll pass on the sandwiches.
How could you even suggest<br/>such a thing, Ted?!
I better<br/>get my 60 bucks back.
No sandwich?
Marshall, it's a palooza.
We've eaten sandwiches<br/>at every palooza.
Lollapalooza, Funkapalooza...
Gender-diversity-awareness-<br/>palooza, junior year.
Yeah, there were<br/>some real bitches there.
Okay, quick,
before Lily gets here,<br/>let's fire this up.
No way. I promised Lily<br/>that I would be responsible.
You're not getting<br/>your 60 bucks back.
Give me that.
Hey, how you<br/>holding up?
Well, I'm about to be<br/>trapped on boat all night
with the guy I cheated on,<br/>the guy I cheated with
and the girl that the guy<br/>I cheated with cheated on.
So, not super.
Hi, Sandy.
You're welcome.
I did not say "Thank you."
Oh, you're too kind.
Too kind.
Excuse me, I<br/>should really try
to have sex with<br/>that new intern.
Robin's boss, Sandy Rivers<br/>hosted this cruise every year,
mostly to hit on<br/>the new employees.
And he'd found a clever way<br/>to never spend a cent.
Up next, another four deaths
in Arizona's record-breaking<br/>heat wave.
You want real<br/>record-breaking heat?
Try Kristoff's Jalapeño<br/>Coconut Vodka martini.
Muy caliente!
Okay, Nora and Kevin
are gonna be here any minute.
I thought I could handle this,<br/>but I can't.
Okay, um, here's the plan.
We'll grab one of the<br/>lifeboats, get back to shore,
destroy the tape<br/>of us doing it...
There's a tape of us doing it?
...and we'll start<br/>a new life together.
Somewhere simple and homey,<br/>like Vermont or Dubai.
Wait, is that what you want?
For us to be together?
Hey, Robin.
Oh, God, I really<br/>can't do this.
Don't worry. Just follow my lead<br/>and keep cool.
Hey, guys!
They know!
Oh, no.
I think that sandwich was<br/>laced with other stuff.
Like, hard meats.
What do you mean?
Well, usually after a sandwich,<br/>I feel paranoid. But I'm not.
Why am I not<br/>feeling paranoid?!
What do you mean?<br/>Calm down, dude!
We'll be fine.
Lily's gonna know.
Listen to me.
Whatever we were just<br/>talking about...
we'll be fine.
You're right, she<br/>won't find out.
Hey, guy
She knows!
Good evening.
A special welcome<br/>our four new interns:
Erika... and so on.
One safety matter:<br/>life preservers are
on the side rails,<br/>in case anyone falls overboard.
That's it.<br/>Have a good night.
Don't drink too much.
Or do.
Beautiful night,<br/>huh, gang?
Yeah, Robin and I<br/>were just cheating--
chatting about<br/>how warm it is.
I'm breaking a<br/>trust-- sweat
in here.
And I thought<br/>we'd be cuckold.
I know why you're<br/>so nervous, Barney.
You do?
You're meeting Nora's parents<br/>tomorrow night, right?
That's it!<br/>That's it!
Let's dance!
Bah!<br/>Whoo!
Lily has no idea I'm high.
You're high?
I'm sorry.
Lily has no idea I'm high.
Okay, well, if<br/>your pregnant wife
has to sit here<br/>sober all night,
she's gonna need<br/>some of them nachos.
You got it.
Hey, dude, fork over<br/>some of them nach...
No, not his.
My own.
Ah. Smart.
Come on, Ted.
What?
And thus began the most<br/>harrowing journey of our lives.
To this day,<br/>Robin and Barney swear
this is the song<br/>they danced to that night.
♪ You fooled around<br/>on your baby ♪
♪ Now the least you could do<br/>is to tell her the truth ♪
♪ Yes, you in the suit ♪

We have to tell them.<br/>Right now.
♪ Sure, act like<br/>it was your idea. ♪
Seriously, you guys suck.
Marshall and I were still<br/>in line to get Lily's nachos.
Dude, we've been<br/>waiting forever.
Even worse, this is the<br/>line for the ladies room.
I can't believe that our<br/>last Groovapalooza was,
what, 12 years ago?
I mean, time is<br/>going by so fast.
I know, it's crazy.
In, like, an eye blink,
this hand will be, like,<br/>an old man's hand.
I recognize the clichéd nature<br/>of what I'm about to say,
but... whoa!
Yeah.
312?
That's our gate.
Dude, we just walked around<br/>the entire arena.
We've been walking<br/>for, like, an hour
and we still haven't<br/>found the nachos.
I bet Lily<br/>is so upset.
Yo, you want<br/>my nachos, bro?
Thank you.
My husband's been gone an hour<br/>looking for these.
If he can't even do that,<br/>how can I trust him as a father?
You can't, bro.<br/>You can't.
I like your long goatee.
Marshall can't even<br/>grow a beard.
Oh, that's sad.
'Cause one's ability to grow<br/>facial hair directly correlates
with one's ability<br/>to be a good father.
I know it does.<br/>I know it does.
Oh.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know<br/>where the nachos are?
Marshall!
Over here.<br/>I found the nacho line.
Oh.
So, how'd it go with Kevin?
Well, I was just about<br/>to tell him...
ok, Kevin...
Erika, I've been meaning<br/>to speak with you all night.
Really?<br/>What about
About me bending your hard<br/>little body over the railing
of this boat<br/>and copulating furiously
while I admire<br/>the New York City skyline.
Or, if you're feeling dirty,<br/>we can always face Jersey.
Thoughts?
Jalapeño!
And just a hint of coconut.
Kevin hit his head,<br/>he might have a concussion.
So obviously<br/>I couldn't tell him.
What about you?
Something even worse<br/>happened to her.
I got a tiny spot of wine<br/>on my sleeve.
I couldn't pile on.
I'm not a monster.
Where are they?
Come on, forget<br/>the nachos.
Everyone here<br/>is having fun.
Look, even these guys.
Check it out.
Wow, music really does<br/>bring people together.
Ted? Ted!
Creepy guitar guy<br/>is following us.
We did a whole nother lap.
Oh, man, we missed like,<br/>half the concert now.
Come on, let's just go<br/>back to our seats.
Ted, Ted, Ted.
The nacho line<br/>was right here all along.
So stupid.
As soon as we dock,<br/>I'm taking Kevin to the E.R.
God, wish last night<br/>never happened.
I don't.
What do you mean?
What if this whole thing,
it isn't the story of how we<br/>both made a horrible mistake
and ruined our relationships,
what if it's actually the story<br/>of how we got back together?
Okay, I'm gonna ask you<br/>one last time.
Is this what you want?
It's what we both want!
Why else are we rushing<br/>to tell them what we did?
On a boat!<br/>That is a terrible idea!
Barney, we tried this<br/>and we failed.
Why try again?
Because I haven't stopped<br/>thinking about you
and you haven't stopped<br/>thinking about me.
It's such a mess.
Why...
Why do you even like me?
I guess...
'cause you're almost<br/>as messed up as I am.
Well, there's the small issue
that we're currently dating<br/>other people.
How about this?
After we dock, let's each do<br/>what we have to do,
and then meet up at MacLaren's<br/>at midnight and...
talk about us.
Don't forget<br/>your mystery gift bags!
They're condoms.
We just went all the way<br/>around again!
Where the hell<br/>are these nachos?!
Who cares<br/>about nachos?
Oh, I love nachos, man!
You gotta relax, man.
You keep worrying about stuff<br/>like nachos,
you're gonna give yourself<br/>a heart attack.
- I'm going back in.<br/>- Fine!
Ha! Joke's on you!
The nacho line was right here<br/>all along!
Robin and Barney<br/>were finally off the boat.
so they both assumed<br/>it was going to be a lot easier
to admit<br/>what they had done.
Kevin...<br/>Me first.
Look, I don't want<br/>to make too much out
of saying "I love you"<br/>for the first time.
Any way I can jump in<br/>with my thing?
Robin... I love you.
Okay, Nora, lo...
Mom! Dad!
Hi, Nora, we<br/>got in early!
Should've done it on the boat.
Ah!
Hey, where's your friend?
We missed almost the entire show<br/>because he put his stupid quest
for nachos ahead of our<br/>friendship, so I bolted.
Well, I'm just a creepy old<br/>guitar player,
but isn't any time spent<br/>with a friend a blessing?
And if nachos is all you seek...
take mine, brother.
Wow!
Thank you.
It's a sign, bro.
It is.
It's a sign<br/>I should go find Marshall!
Marshall! Marshall!
So, Barney, Nora's told us<br/>so much about you,
but we want to know everything.
Uh, let's see. Suit, laser tag.
I say "wait for it" a lot.<br/>That's about it.
You two must be exhausted.
I'll make coffee.
I'm so glad to see how happy<br/>you both are.
When you meet<br/>the right person,
you know it.
You can't stop<br/>thinking about them.
They're your best friend...
and your soul mate.
You can't wait to spend the<br/>rest of your life with them.
No one and nothing else<br/>can compare.
Now, where the hell<br/>is that coffee, eh?
Look, Nora, there's something<br/>I have to tell you.
Heart attack.
Oh, God, Ted was right.<br/>I have to relax!
Ted!
- Marshall!<br/>- Ted?
Ted!<br/>Marshall!
Oh, Ted! Oh, Ted!
I'm so sorry! You were right.
No, Marshall, you...<br/>Yeah, I was right.
But look, nachos!
Come on. Let's<br/>go back inside.
That's it.
It's over.
We missed the whole show.
So...
yup, I love you.
Look, Kevin...
there's something<br/>I have to tell you.
I cheated on you.
I don't even know<br/>how to react.
I am so sorry.
I know I don't get<br/>any second chances,
but you will always be...
Was this a one-time thing?
Can you tell me<br/>it didn't mean anything?
No.
I'm sorry, Ted.
I still want to have fun,
There's just not<br/>enough time, you know?
I know.
It's all going by<br/>so damn fast.
Lily!
Hey! Oh, Lily,<br/>I'm so sorry
that we ruined our night.<br/>Yeah.
What are you guys talking about?
You've been gone less<br/>than two minutes.
Kids, she was right.
My hand.
Whoa!
Ah! concert!
Nachos! Ah!
Music!
- Time!<br/>- Nachos!
Thank you!
It's a sign, bro.
Oh, oh...
Heart attack!<br/>Marshall!
Marshall!
Time...
Lily!
Marshall, do you get<br/>what this means?
Life isn't moving<br/>too fast.
We-we still have time<br/>for everything
And we're not gonna miss<br/>the concert!
I'm freaking out right now.
- We gotta get out of here.<br/>- Yeah.
Do you guys know where<br/>the ladies' room is?
- No idea.<br/>- Haven't seen it.
Hey! How's it going?
Oh, not great.<br/>Nora and I broke up.
Oh, my God, what happened?
I don't really feel like getting<br/>into it, but...
I think the worst part is over.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
- Hey, Kev.<br/>- What's up, Kev?
How's it going, buddy?
Hey, guys.
There's something<br/>I have to tell you.
Then don't.
What?
If there's one thing I've<br/>learned as a therapist,
it's that just because something<br/>needs to be told
doesn't always mean<br/>it needs to be heard.
Kevin, I did something bad.
We've all done bad things.
Doesn't mean we're bad people.
Look, I don't care
about every detail<br/>from your past,
and I hope you don't care<br/>about mine either.
What I do care about is you,
and that from tonight forward,<br/>you're in this as much as I am.
What do you think?
I'm such a mess.
Why do you even like me?
Come here.
I am constantly amazed<br/>by the things you say,
entranced by the things you do,
and unlike a certain Jalapeño<br/>Coconut Vodka martini,
you're easy on the eye
And if we're together<br/>long enough,
I hope that one day you see<br/>yourself the way I see you.
That's a pretty good answer.
Sometimes hours<br/>can feel like minutes
and sometimes a single second<br/>can last a lifetime.
For Barney, the second that<br/>would never end was this one.
Well, um, I should go.
Tough night.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be. It's nothing.
It feels good to be sober again.
Man, how long have we been<br/>sitting here, right?
12 seconds and you're<br/>in the wrong booth.
I should go to bed.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In the fall of 2011,<br/>Lily and Marshall received
a surprising gift<br/>from Lily's grandparents:
their house in Long Island.
Lily and Marshall decided to<br/>sell it for one simple reason.
It's Long Island.
I don't want to spend<br/>my Saturday in Long Island.
I know, babe,
but the realtor staged the<br/>place with fake furniture
and she wants us to check it<br/>out before the open house.
All right.
Can we at least do it<br/>on the fake bed?
I'm embarrassed<br/>that you have to ask.
So, they headed out<br/>to Long Island,
and when they walked<br/>in the door...
We'll take it!
We-We can't take it.
We're the ones selling it.
We are selling it, right?
Baby, your grandparents gave<br/>you this house outright.
So, the way I see it,<br/>we have five options.
One: sell it.
Two: year-round<br/>haunted house.
Three: giant fence around the<br/>perimeter, chimp sanctuary.
There's already a tire<br/>swing in the backyard.
Four: we destroy it<br/>with sledgehammers.
I like four.
Or five: we move in,<br/>raise our children
and make this our family home.
Till they graduate.
Then we destroy it<br/>with sledgehammers.
As a family.
No, this is crazy!
We are New York people.
We have a big, beautiful<br/>apartment that we love.
You're right.
But something happened
to Lily and Marshall that day.
Something that happens<br/>to all New Yorkers
who return home from anywhere<br/>other than New York.
Their big, lovely apartment...
Huh. That's weird.
...shrank.
Okay, after Thanksgiving,<br/>I'm cutting out carbs.
♪ How I Met Your Mother 7x11 ♪<br/>The Rebound Girl<br/>Original Air Date on November 21, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Now, kids, it had been<br/>a rough couple weeks for Barney.
First, he cheated<br/>on his girlfriend with Robin,
then he broke up<br/>with his girlfriend for Robin,
then Robin chose Kevin<br/>over him.
So he was kind of<br/>in a bad place.
Hey.
You all right?
Why wouldn't I<br/>be all right?
Barney's single again!
It's what America's<br/>been clamoring for.
You just went<br/>through a break-up.
That's usually when people<br/>do something crazy.
If you were a girl,<br/>you'd have cut bangs
and be dating you by now.
Just promise me<br/>you won't do something crazy.
I promise I won't<br/>do something crazy.
Don't worry, he's gonna do<br/>something crazy.
In fact, I think<br/>I'm done with girls.
I'm not sure I even<br/>like them anymore.
Based on all the stuff you've<br/>done to them over the years,
I'm not sure<br/>you ever liked them.
I'm serious.
Come on, you love girls.
If anyone should be<br/>done with girls, it's me.
Look at the year I've had.
Zoey, Victoria,<br/>the Slutty Pumpkin.
Now I'm worried<br/>you're gonna do something crazy.
I'm not gonna do<br/>something crazy.
And yes, I'm gonna do<br/>something crazy, too.
But girls, man.
Girls.
- You know what would kick ass?<br/>- Being gay?
Being gay would kick ass!
Word. Guys understand<br/>each other.
Imagine a relationship where,
instead of talking<br/>about feelings all the time,
you just play some Madden,<br/>eat a pizza,
give each other a happy,<br/>roll over
and have some<br/>cuddle-free shut-eye.
Bro, for what it's worth,
if we were both gay,<br/>you'd be my first call.
Would you mind calling Marshall<br/>and telling him that?
'Cause he thinks...
No, this is only in a scenario
where just you and I are gay,<br/>not Marshall.
But if all three of us were gay,
you'd pick me<br/>over Marshall, right?
If all three of us were gay?
Girlfriend, we would<br/>all three of us have some fun.
Damn right we would.
We're not gay.
Nope. Stuck with girls.
I wish men could have children
on their own, like sea horses.
Are you saying<br/>what I think you're saying?
They have a little pouch.
They should be called<br/>sea kangaroos.
No, y-you want kids?
Maybe I've kind of<br/>lately been thinking
about the whole<br/>wife and kids thing.
Just minus the wife.
You could always go it alone.
Like Mr. Drummond<br/>on Diff'rent Strokes.
Yeah, but that was the '80s,<br/>when you could just swing by
any inner-city playground<br/>in your limo
and scoop up some kids.<br/>- Mmm.
- Simpler times.<br/>- Hmm.
I guess it's better<br/>to have someone
in it with you anyway, you know?<br/>Lifetime partnership.
The only partnership in my life
that has stood the test of time<br/>is this one.
The sacred bond of man and bro.
Maybe we should start<br/>a family together.
Are you kidding?
This place is huge.
I mean, look, I can<br/>dance all crazy in here.
Oh! Sh...
Listen, um, Robin,
are you okay with us all
doing Thanksgiving<br/>out in East Meadow?
Uh, yeah, I guess<br/>that'd be nice.
Oh, great!
And then after Thanksgiving,<br/>Lily and I were thinking
that we would just<br/>stay at the house
until, you know...
we die.
What?
No!
You can't move<br/>to Long Island!
But this house<br/>is so nice.
It's big, and it's clean,<br/>and if there's cockroaches,
they respect us enough<br/>to sneak around.
Listen to yourself.
This is Pregnancy Brain<br/>all over again.
No, I'm done<br/>with Pregnancy Brain.
I've moved on<br/>to weird pregnancy sex dreams.
Officer.
You know. You know.
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not<br/>in the right mind to be making
this decision<br/>right now.
You know what? Robin's right.
We are in no state of mind<br/>to make this kind of decision.
Thank you. And now you're<br/>stepping off the crazy bus.
We let the universe decide.
And now you're back on board.
You hear that, Universe?
If you send us a sign<br/>in the next...
24 hours, then we're moving<br/>to Long Island!
Okay?
Go.
Hey, guys,
for the last time,<br/>this place is enormous...
Oh!
Geez, how many lamps<br/>do you have?
It's genius!
Instead of throwing away<br/>your life marrying some girl,
you just go splitsies on a kid<br/>with your best bro!
I wouldn't have to choose
between dating<br/>and having a family.
Hell, I could bring<br/>the kids on dates!
And a broken home?
Um, what's that?
Our kids will never know,
'cause we're never<br/>gonna split up!
Why would we?
I mean, sure,<br/>when your wife walks in
on you banging a hot flight<br/>attendant, you get a divorce.
But when your bro-parent<br/>walks in on you
banging a hot<br/>flight attendant...
You get five of these bad boys,<br/>right up high!
And you totally<br/>join in, right?!
Oh, no, there's the line.<br/>That's the line.
We found the line.<br/>It's good we know where it is.
Hey, guys.
- Hey!<br/>- Hey.
We have an announcement.
So what you're<br/>saying is,
if you're meant to move<br/>to Long Island,
some sign from the universe
will magically appear<br/>at your doorstep?
Now, kids, I don't think<br/>there was a knock on the door
at that exact moment, but for<br/>the purposes of this story...
Hi, I'm Clive.
I live upstairs from you.
Is this your sign?
I don't know, Clive.
Is it?
Oh, did we leave that outside?
Yeah, we're selling our house<br/>in Long Island.
Oh. Too bad you're not<br/>selling this place.
I'd love to turn<br/>mine into a duplex.
And I'd give you a really<br/>good price for it,
because I am so rich.
He did not<br/>say that.
His shoes did.
Okay, the point is,<br/>we got the sign.
We're moving to East Meadow.
Let's get some champagne.
And just like that,<br/>Lily and Marshall
were beginning a new chapter<br/>in their lives.
Which meant only one thing<br/>for us...
We're having a baby!
Bro-parents activate!
- Hey, let's talk baby names!<br/>- Barney...
Oh, my God!<br/>That was my first choice, too.
No, listen.<br/>You and I are drunk.
Which means there's a chance<br/>that adopting a baby...
no matter how cute<br/>he is in my head
with his little cowboy outfit on<br/>and he's riding our dog
like a horse<br/>and we also have a dog,
purebred Golden,<br/>but it's okay, she's a rescue...
might not be a good idea.
You're right.
So let's go home,<br/>take some aspirin,
drink lots of water,
and then see if it's still<br/>a good idea tomorrow.
It's still a good idea!
It's totally still<br/>a good idea!
We're having a baby!
Kids, I cannot<br/>stress this enough:
Barney and I were going<br/>through a tough time.
You're not leaving,<br/>and that's final.
Look what I bought at<br/>4:00 a.m. in New York City.
A bootleg VHS of a very,<br/>very popular Korean movie,
this genuine Lenny Vintone purse
and the number of a man<br/>who can get me a kidney.
Do that on Long Island.
Look, Robin, we appreciate<br/>that you want us
to stay in the city, but<br/>this is what we want.
I mean, you<br/>understand, right?
No.
Here are a<br/>few fun facts
about Long Island.
Number one:<br/>it's Brooklyn's fart trail.
So Barney and I...
and again,<br/>going through a tough time,
can't stress that enough...
found an adoption agency<br/>Web site
and filled out<br/>their online application.
Name: Barney Stinson.
Ted Mosby.
Address...
Oh, put my address<br/>in Westchester.
They'll want to see we'll be
raising this child<br/>in a good environment.
You know, the suburbs.
What? No.
- All my guys are here.<br/>- Your guys?
Yeah. You know how I got<br/>a guy for everything?
Well, they're all in New York.
My suit guy, my shoe guy,<br/>my ticket guy, my club guy.
And if I don't have<br/>a guy for something,
then I have a guy guy<br/>to get me a guy.
And oddly enough,<br/>his name is Guy.
Okay, fine.<br/>How about this?
We stay in the city during<br/>the week, then on the weekend,
country house in the burbs!
This is why bro-parenting works!
Totally!
And with your salary<br/>plus my salary,
we can totally<br/>afford two places.
Oh.
What?
So... uh, you're gonna<br/>keep your job?
Robin, this discussion<br/>is closed.
The universe told us to do it,<br/>so we're doing it.
Well, the universe<br/>gets it wrong sometimes.
Remember when Marshall<br/>was trying to decide between
becoming an environmental lawyer<br/>and working at a bank?
That's a funny story.
Marshall was fed up<br/>with his job at GNB and was
thinking about<br/>leaving it all behind,
so he and Lily agreed<br/>he should wait for a sign
from the universe<br/>to tell him what to do.
Then one day...
Of course.
It's so clear.
It's been right there all along.
I have to call Lily.
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, but, um, can<br/>I please borrow your...
- Ernie Hudson?<br/>- Yes.
Can I borrow your phone?
Who you gonna call?
And did Marshall<br/>become a Ghostbuster?
That firehouse<br/>is still for sale.
Even Ernie Hudson begged you<br/>not to go through with that.
Ernie Hudson is a coward!
Oh!
Of course I'm gonna<br/>keep my job.
Why wouldn't<br/>I keep my job?
Well, I mean,<br/>this whole architecture thing...
isn't it more of a hobby?
Excuse me?
And now we're fighting.<br/>You know what?
Forget I said anything.
No! No, no, no.<br/>We're having this discussion.
Architecture<br/>is my life's work.
Why don't you quit your job?<br/>I don't even know
what it is<br/>you do for a living.
"What it is I do for a living?"
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day<br/>so that our baby can have food
and clothes and a nice house,
while you sit around<br/>doodling pictures of buildings.
That's "what it is I do."
You know what? Screw this.<br/>I'm gonna go to the bar.
Yeah, right, right,<br/>'cause the answer's always
at the bottom of a bottle!
Wait, wait, wait!<br/>Hold it!
Brainstorm.<br/>Brainstorm.
Nobody quits their job.
We get a nanny.
Dibs on the nanny.
No. No banging the nanny.
Ted, please don not dig in<br/>on this whole
no-banging-the-nanny policy.
Okay, fine.<br/>We'll get two nannies.
One for banging,<br/>one for childcare.
Slash banging.<br/>Dibs on both nannies!
Just think of it, Ted,<br/>you and me,
living together,<br/>with our kid,
my two hot nannies,<br/>our pet cobra...
What?
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted.<br/>Don't be a pill about this.
And we'll have amazing<br/>weeklong parties,
and there'll be swords<br/>and ninja stars lying around.
That's when I realized:
adopting a baby with a friend?<br/>Crazy.
Adopting a baby with Barney?<br/>Freaking nuts.
I can't adopt a baby with you,<br/>Barney.
Why not?
Because we don't even<br/>have one yet
and you're already<br/>a terrible father.
Oh, I get it.
You want one of the nannies.
Well, you can't have 'em!<br/>They're mine!
So you're just gonna have<br/>to get yourself a third nanny.
Except dibs on<br/>the third nanny! Good day!
Which brings us<br/>to Thanksgiving.
Marshall, Lily and Robin<br/>were heading out
to Long Island early<br/>to get ready.
Okay, how is this<br/>even possible?!
'Cause how did we even get it<br/>in here?!
Okay, I change my mind.<br/>I want an epidural.
You guys are crazy.
This place is enormous.
I mean, look arou...
Have you never heard<br/>of overhead lighting?!
You're right.
I get it.
This place is great.
Um, excuse me.<br/>Where is the restroom?
Oh. Right there.<br/>Oh, good, great.
I'm just gonna go<br/>in there and...
not come out until you promise<br/>never to move away!
It's a good thing<br/>we have three bathrooms.
Hey, Barney.
Uh, listen, sorry<br/>about the other day
when I said you'd be<br/>a terrible father.
You had no reason<br/>to think otherwise.
Totally understandable.<br/>I'm not mad.
Thanks.
And, uh, let's be honest,
we were both acting<br/>a little crazy.
I don't think either of us<br/>is truly ready
for the responsibility of...
Daddy's home.
Uh, Barney, uh, where<br/>did you get this baby?
Please.
Did you adopt it?
Please.
Do you have<br/>a baby guy?
Did Guy the guy guy<br/>get you a baby guy?
Ted, we should get going.
No, no, no. I'm not going<br/>anywhere with you.
For all I know, I could be
aiding and abetting<br/>a kidnapping.
Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.
He's just being a wittle loud.<br/>He wuvs you! Yes, he does!
- This is insane!<br/>- You'll feel better outside.
- Come on.<br/>- No, I can't.
Yeah. Na-na-na.
But then we went outside.
Oh, my goodness.
- What a beautiful baby.<br/>- Thank you.
By the way, my friend and I,<br/>we're not a couple.
We are two straight guys<br/>who are single
and we have a baby.<br/>Just so you know.
Look at this sweet girl.
Hi. I was just telling<br/>this first girl,
my friend and I,<br/>both straight,
both available,<br/>and we have a baby.
Oh, who is this little angel?
Okay, real quick:<br/>me and him,
not gay, single,<br/>have a baby.
We should look<br/>into having a sign made.
Kids, again, we were going<br/>through a difficult time.
But this part was kind of fun.
Aw...!<br/>So cute!
This is awesome.
Right?
Robin, come out<br/>and talk to us.
I'm not coming out<br/>of this bathroom
until everyone stops<br/>acting crazy!
No one is being crazy.
Again, for the purposes<br/>of this story...
Ted and I have<br/>a baby. Crazy!
What the hell is that?
Guys, this is Hurricane<br/>Stinson-Mosby.
Mosby-Stinson.
You named your<br/>baby Hurricane?
That is...
ultimately inconsiderate<br/>to the child
who has to live<br/>with that name.
Okay, how the hell<br/>does Barney have a baby?
No idea. Super confused.
I'm finding it best<br/>to just sort of go with it.
She's super cute,<br/>though, right?
Wait a minute.
Oh, guh! Hurricane<br/>dookied in her drawers.
Ha-ha!<br/>Poopy pants!
She needs<br/>a new diaper.
Right. Where do you<br/>keep your diapers?
We don't have any.
You don't... Wow.
Okay. (scoffs) I guess<br/>I'll go buy some.
You're gonna be a mom and<br/>you don't have any diapers?
Lord, watch over<br/>that child.
Uh, okay.
Come here, you.
So, there was talk<br/>of a cheese plate?
Hey.
Cheese?
Thanks.
If you don't mind<br/>me asking...
what-what is<br/>this all about?
I mean, you are one of the most<br/>strong, independent,
non-locking-themselves-in-
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving<br/>people I know.
Why-why are you so upset<br/>about us moving?
Maybe I just need you guys<br/>more than you think.
Is this about more<br/>than us moving?
This is good cheese.
Robin?
Yeah?
Do you think I should've become<br/>a Ghostbuster?
I think you made<br/>the right call, buddy.
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you<br/>where Barney got this baby.
But do you have any idea why?
Well, a few nights ago,<br/>we were talking...
you know, "We hate girls,<br/>we wish we were gay,"
just guy stuff.
And we kind of<br/>sort of decided to...
adopt a baby.
Yeah, that's crazy.
I know.
Is it, though?
Yes.
I know.
But is it, though?
Yes.
Well, so what if it's crazy?
I've been ready to meet someone<br/>to start a family with
for a long time now,<br/>and I keep not meeting her.
Barney is one of my best friends<br/>in the world, we rarely fight,
and once we iron out<br/>the whole pet cobra thing,
we will be amazing dads.
Why shouldn't we try this?
When's the last time<br/>you fed her?
She had some root beer<br/>on the train.
Oh, Ted.<br/>And I'm sorry,
but you cannot call<br/>a baby Hurricane.
Actually, her name is Sadie.
James, what are you doing here?
Did Barney<br/>not tell you
that we were coming<br/>for Thanksgiving?
Uh, no.
Then he probably also<br/>did not tell you
that he was babysitting<br/>our new daughter.
This is your daughter?
Oh, thank God.
And congratulations.
Thanks. Come here.
Aw...<br/>Aw...
I guess this is good-bye,<br/>Hurri... Sadie.
Your name is Hurricane.<br/>Don't ever forget it.
Go with him. Go on.
Come here.<br/>That a girl.
Hey, Ted,
I overheard<br/>your little speech.
It's not crazy.
About ten years ago,
my best friend and I<br/>nearly did the same thing.
She was single, I was single,<br/>we both wanted a family.
It made sense.
But now?
Every day, we thank our lucky<br/>stars that we didn't do it.
'Cause what she found<br/>with her husband
and what I found<br/>with mine...
it was worth the wait.
Hurricane's<br/>a cool name.
Isn't it, Tom?
The pet store<br/>was closer,
so I just got her<br/>some wee-wee pads.
Oh, I also got this.
It's beef-flavored<br/>and it's good for her teeth.
James! Tom! Hey!
Lily...
did you get<br/>the e-mail
that I sent you<br/>about inviting
James and Tom<br/>to Thanksgiving?
I sent it to your CompuServe.<br/>That's your main one, right?
Happy Thanksgiving, bro.
- Thanks. Hi.<br/>- Hey!
Let's go sit down.
Hi.
All right,<br/>you got me.
James is my baby guy.
But these past three hours...<br/>magical, right?
We can do this!<br/>Say we can do this.
We can't do this.
Sorry, dude.
We got to wait<br/>for the real thing...
no matter how tough it gets.
It gets pretty tough.
I know it does, buddy.
I have some time<br/>before dinner, right?
I'm going to go...<br/>I'm gonna take a little walk.
All right. All right.
God.
- Hi.<br/>- Hey.
Are we still friends?
Hope so.
Good.
'Cause get this.
Ted almost adopted a baby.
Crazy, right?
Poor guy's going<br/>through some stuff.
He actually tried<br/>to rope me into it.
Can you imagine me<br/>being someone's dad?
I'm pregnant.

:02,540<br/>both available,<br/>and we have a baby.
Oh, who is this little angel?
Okay, real quick:<br/>me and him,
not gay, single,<br/>have a baby.
We should look<br/>into having a sign made.
Kids, again, we were going<br/>through a difficult time.
But this part was kind of fun.
Aw...!<br/>So cute!
This is awesome.
Right?
Robin, come out<br/>and talk to us.
I'm not coming out<br/>of this bathroom
until everyone stops<br/>acting crazy!
No one is being crazy.
Again, for the purposes<br/>of this story...
Ted and I have<br/>a baby. Crazy!
What the hell is that?
Guys, this is Hurricane<br/>Stinson-Mosby.
Mosby-Stinson.
You named your<br/>baby Hurricane?
That is...
ultimately inconsiderate<br/>to the child
who has to live<br/>with that name.
Okay, how the hell<br/>does Barney have a baby?
No idea. Supe</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, have I ever told you
the story<br/>of how I met your father?
Well, I'll just skip ahead
to the moment I told him<br/>I was pregnant.
W... What happened?
Did I pass out?
Not exactly.
I'm pregnant.
Are you sure you're not<br/>just getting fat?
Oh, yeah.
So, um, you're pregnant.
Yeah.
Huh.
Looks like nobody told<br/>your boobs.
What happened?
Did I pass out?
Oh, my...
Please stop hitting me!
Hey.
Are... Are you sure you're...
Well, no, not positive.
I'm a week late.
But I'm never late;<br/>it's a point of pride with me.
I'm going to go
see the doctor on Monday<br/>to find out for sure.
Until then, not a word<br/>of this to anyone.
Not even Kevin?
I mean, it's probably his.
I've spent years<br/>training my boys
to swim the other way.
Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.
If I'm pregnant, you're the dad.
That's wonderful!
Huh?
I'm gonna be a daddy!
Okay, one scotch for me,
one iced tea on the rocks glass<br/>for Mommy.
Stop it.
Sorry, sorry.
Keeping it secret.
Oop, I think I gave you<br/>the wrong one.
Here, let me just...
Give it to me.<br/>Drop... let go.
Take it away from you.
Barney, why are you<br/>so happy about this?
Because this is perfect.
I want to be a dad.
This is not good news.
I have a boyfriend.
Yeah, but if Kevin<br/>weren't around...
It doesn't matter!
I don't want kids.
I've never wanted kids,
and never, in a million years,<br/>will I ever want kids.
Sorry, kids.
I can't have a baby.
Hey, guys!
Guess what this is!
One of your socks?<br/>Boom! You're huge.
No, it's our unborn son's<br/>Christmas stocking.
Grandma Gunderson<br/>started knitting it
the day Lily and I got married.
She died before<br/>she could finish.
I miss stockings.
My stepdad Clint<br/>made us get rid of anything
that reminds him of the<br/>commercialization of Christmas.
I thought you said he<br/>dresses up as Santa.
Yeah, but, uh,<br/>to protest gender stereotypes,
he plays Santa as a woman.
Though, he keeps the beard.
The result is disturbing.
Well, we should go.
We have to get<br/>to We B Babies
so that we can register<br/>for our shower.
No can do.
Um, I have a big project<br/>that I'm working on.
This is Richard Holdman's house<br/>in East Meadow.
Last year, he had the<br/>most visited Christmas display
in the tri-state area.
But not this year.<br/>You know why?
Because Big Fudge<br/>has come to town,
and he brought his two friends:
Mannim... Steamroller.
Game on.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Uh, it's just, um...
I hate Mannheim<br/>Steamroller.
Isn't there anyone<br/>else you can use?
Come on! Who am I gonna use<br/>if not the Steamroller?!
I don't know. AC/DC?
AC/DC?
Robin, do you have any idea
why they call them<br/>Mannheim Steamroller?
Because they rock... so hard,<br/>so festively,
that steam comes out<br/>of your brain.
As it melts.
So I have to go to<br/>We B Babies by myself?
Robin and I will<br/>go with you.
Barney, what are<br/>we doing here?
I want to show you<br/>that having a kid
is nothing to be afraid of.
Kids. Stop.
Okay, first<br/>on the registry:
nipple butter.
Uh-oh.
As you breast-feed,
your nipples stretch out,<br/>like, four inches
and get all dry and cracked.
The nipple butter<br/>stops the bleeding.
My four-inch nipples are<br/>going to crack and bleed?!
Yes, but while the baby is<br/>gnawing on your bleeding nips,
look what she'll be wearing.
Insane Duane?
Barney?
Insane Duane was your father's<br/>best friend,
back in the days before<br/>he met me or your Uncle Ted.
We're going back to her place.
Boom!
All right, you win!
Here's 20 for picking up a girl<br/>with only one word.
And here's another 20<br/>for that word being "boner."
Thank you.
I'll meet you back here in an<br/>hour when I'm done with, uh...
Ah, who cares what her name is;<br/>she won't be
around long enough<br/>for it to matter.
Nice!
Shh...
I can't believe<br/>I haven't seen you around.
Well, after Sheila and I<br/>had that quickie,
my life's been playdates,<br/>preschools and poops.
I haven't set foot<br/>in a bar in years.
You stopped drinking?
Oh, I still drink.
Vaginal<br/>numbing spray.
Apparently, after child birth,
your hoo-ha looks like<br/>Rocky Balboa's face.
- You can't have a baby!<br/>- I can't have a baby!
The next day,<br/>we went to the doctor.
Well, Mrs. Scherbatsky,
I'm sure that you<br/>and your husband...
Uh, he's not my husband.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Your boyfriend then.
He's not my boyfriend.
Oh, bozhe.
All right, well,<br/>I will just cut to the chase.
Wait! Wait.
All right.
Okay.
All right, we're ready. Good.
not pregnant.
Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!<br/>- Yeah!
That's what I'm<br/>talking about!
Yeah, you know,<br/>you know!
Again, sorry kids.
Hey, mister.
Are you putting up<br/>all these Christmas lights?
Oh, kid, by the time I'm done,
you're gonna be able to see this<br/>son of a bitch from outer space.
Ah, cool.
I wanted to put lights<br/>on our house,
but my dad says he's too busy<br/>with work and stuff.
Hey, what do you say, uh,<br/>you come back here next weekend
and help me out?
Yeah!
You've got yourself a deal.
I'm Scott.
I'm... Mr. Eriksen.
Thanks, Mr. E.
Mr. E.
Looks like some little scamp<br/>just earned the right
to put the Vikings helmet<br/>on baby Jesus.
Later that week,<br/>as I was enjoying every second
of not being pregnant...
Next on Teenage Mommies...
But you said<br/>you would watch Bella.
I have cheerleading practice.
Sucks to be you, Braces.
Oh. Um...
Yello!
Uh, yeah, I can come back in.
Robin, we ran some<br/>tests last week.
This is going to be<br/>difficult to hear.
And then the doctor said a<br/>bunch of medical stuff that...
well, the gist of it was this.
I can't have a baby.
No. You can't have a baby.
Uh, great.
Uh, well, I mean,<br/>um, not-not great.
I mean, I've never wanted kids,
so if it has to happen<br/>to someone...
Robin, is there anyone<br/>you can talk to about this?
Perhaps a close friend?
I knew I could have<br/>talked to my friends.
But, it's just, I already knew
exactly how<br/>they would all react.
Ted would go into overdrive<br/>trying to make me feel better.
You need comfort food.
Fried chicken, mac and cheese,<br/>mashed potatoes.
Open your present,<br/>I'll work on these shoulders.
Okay, just breathe,<br/>relax, eat your chicken.
Come on,<br/>eat, breathe,
open it, breathe,<br/>open it, eat.
Robin, why are you so tense?!
Lily would just implode.
And here I've been going<br/>on and on about babies.
Oh, I am such a bad friend!
And I'd wind up comforting her.
It's okay.
You have to punch<br/>me in the face!
Marshall would ask me<br/>a ton of questions
I don't know the answers to.
- Have you thought about adoption?<br/>- Um, well...
Does this kind of thing<br/>run in your family?
Uh...
What was the date, duration
and consistency<br/>of your last period?
And your father would<br/>bend over backwards
trying to make me laugh.
A priest and a rabbi<br/>walk into a bar--
no, a barbershop--<br/>no, a post office--
no, it's two priests--<br/>no, it's two ducks--
no, a priest holding a duck--<br/>and he's Polish.
The priest, not the duck.
Actually, the duck<br/>could be Polish, too.
Doesn't matter.
Yes it does.<br/>The duck's not Polish.
And when that didn't work,
he would actually<br/>bend over backwards.
Pratfall!
Ow!
The bottom line is, I didn't<br/>feel like talking about it.
So when Ted asked...
Hey, Robin, you okay?<br/>You look upset.
I just came up with the first<br/>lie that popped into my head.
Yeah. Uh...
I just found out I can never...
be a pole-vaulter<br/>for the Canadian Olympic team.
I'm too tall or something.
Robin, I'm sorry.<br/>I'm so sorry, Robin.
I had no idea.<br/>That's terrible.
Can we get some fried chicken<br/>over here, stat!
I am such a<br/>bad friend!
Three slutty nuns<br/>show up at St. Peter's--
Wait, wait, they're not slutty.
Well, they are, but you're not<br/>supposed to know that yet.
Um...
Hey, baby, what's up?
Hey, uh, listen,<br/>the construction of
the Symphony of Illumination<br/>is taking
a little longer than I thought.
Good thing I have<br/>Scott here to help me.
Right, Scott?
You betcha, Mr. E!
Bad news.
Robin's too tall
to be an Olympic<br/>pole-vaulter.
Has she filed an appeal<br/>with the IOC?
Have you filed<br/>an appeal with the IOC?
Can she make herself shorter<br/>by slouching?
Can you make yourself<br/>shorter by slouching?
Has she considered<br/>going back to school
and competing at<br/>the collegiate level?
Have you considered<br/>going back to school and...
I don't want to talk about it.
Sorry.
I love you, baby.<br/>See you tomorrow.
Okay, I love you, too.
Scott?
Scott, I dropped my phone.
Yep, found it.
Could you bring it up here?
You got it.
Hey, while I'm at it,<br/>can I get you a beer?
He wants to bring<br/>the old man a beer.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, there's a whole case<br/>in the fridge.
Thanks, son.
Do you, do you mind<br/>if I call you "son"?
You can call me<br/>whatever you want...
jackass.
Scott?
The ladder fell.
Scott?
♪ ♪
Scott!
What are we doing?
Listen, um,
I know things have been<br/>kind of weird
between you and me<br/>these past couple weeks,
so I just want to say I'm...
I'm glad we're back<br/>to where we started.
- Yeah.<br/>- Friends with benefits.
- No.<br/>- Just like always.
Never been that.<br/>Just friends.
With benefits.<br/>We'll talk about it later.
Look at all<br/>these babies.
Isn't it crazy how,<br/>now that we're not having one,
babies are cute again?
Look at that one.
I'm good.
No, I'm serious.<br/>Look, look.
Damn it.
That thing's cute as crap.
Screw you, baby.
Scott?
Scott!
What is going on?
Hey, Mr. E.<br/>Scott...
if you do not let me down,<br/>I am going to scream
my head off until someone<br/>comes to help me,
and then you're going to have to<br/>explain all of this to the cops.
And then you'll have to explain<br/>why there's
a picture of my ding-dong<br/>on your phone.
There is no picture of your...
There is now.
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty.
Scott?
Scott!
Scott!
Marshall keeps
asking me to text him<br/>pictures of my boobies.
After all these years,
he sometimes still acts<br/>like a teenager.
I'll be right back.
Insane Duane.
It's Sane Duane now.
You used to be<br/>magnificent.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, um,<br/>I guess this, um,
this pole-vaulting thing<br/>is finally hitting me.
I don't get it, Robin.
Did you really want<br/>to be a pole-vaulter?
No, no, I was,<br/>uh, I was always
adamantly against having a...
uh, a pole-vaulting career,
even though it's<br/>what most women want.
Most women want<br/>to be a pole-vaulter?
In Canada--<br/>it's very big up there.
You know, it's,<br/>it's meet a nice guy,
get married, vault some poles,
but I...
never wanted that.
Of course, it's one thing<br/>not to want something.
It's another to be told<br/>you can't have it.
I guess it's,<br/>it's just nice knowing
that you could someday do it<br/>if you changed your mind.
But now, all of a sudden,<br/>that door is closed.
What about the one where you ski<br/>and shoot at the same time?
That seems like something<br/>you'd be good at.
Oh, my God, Robin, look at this.
O Cana-dorable!
Am I right?
Excuse me.
Yep, this works.
Scott, when I get
down from here, you are going
to be in big, big trouble,<br/>mister.
Come on, Mr. E.
Didn't you ever cut loose<br/>when you were a kid?
That's irrelevant.
I mean, of course I did.
One time, when my parents<br/>were out of town,
my brothers and I set<br/>the basement on fire
hosting<br/>an amateur wrestling exhibition.
There were some theatrics.
See, you get me.
I don't think of you as some<br/>dummy I trapped on the roof.
I think of you more like,<br/>like my dad.
Can we keep the party going<br/>for 30 more minutes, please?
Okay, Scott.
Thanks, Pop.
It's fine, kid just needed<br/>to blow off some steam.
No!
Grandma Gunderson knitted that!
Scott...!
That was crazy.
She just ran<br/>out of there crying.
Now she's not<br/>answering her phone.
She's been acting really weird<br/>for a few weeks now,
really since the night<br/>we discussed the hurricane.
Barney, you split a cab home.
Did she say anything?
We didn't really talk much.
Well, lucky for us,
someone at this table is skilled
in the art of detection.
Robin's upset.
She and Kevin<br/>are having trouble.
- He cheated on her.<br/>- No way.
Kevin's an honest, decent guy<br/>who never on his best day
could pull a hotter chick<br/>than Robin.
Maybe Robin cheated on him.
Maybe Robin is the dirty bird<br/>who slept with someone else.
I don't know,<br/>this pole-vaulting thing seems
like a slam dunk to me.
Oh, it is so obvious.
Barney.
What is the name of that guy
you worked with-- uh, Randy?
It was Randy.
Wait a second.
I just cracked this case.
The little maple leaf onesie.
It made her homesick.
That's why she's so upset.
She's not going home<br/>for Christmas.
She wants me<br/>to invite her to Ohio.
That's got to be it!
Either that<br/>or she slept with Barney.
Oh, you must be Scott.
Oh, hello, ma'am.
It's nice to finally<br/>see your face.
Well, I'd better go<br/>hit those books.
Hold it right there, young man.
This is for helping out<br/>my husband.
Wow, 50 bucks.
Merry Christmas.
Lily!
An airplane ticket<br/>to Cleveland?
I know it's not Canada,<br/>but it starts with a "C"
and it's cold as balls,<br/>so get packed.
You're coming home<br/>with me for Christmas.
Yeah, nice try, dude.
I wouldn't go to Cleveland
for $125 million<br/>paid over six years.
Still?
Still with the LeBron jokes?
Where's that ring, huh?
Where's that ring<br/>he's supposed to have by now?
Look, I just-- I thought<br/>you were bummed
about not going home<br/>for Christmas.
Are you kidding?
I love New York at Christmas.
It's so quiet and peaceful.
Got my eggnog to keep<br/>me company, so...
Robin, what's wrong?
- Nothing.<br/>- Just tell me.
Why do you need<br/>to know so bad?
So I can cheer you up.
It's not your job<br/>to cheer me up.
Yes, it is.
Cheering you up is my job.
Well, then, you're fired.
You can't fire me.
I'm union, bitch.
It's not your job<br/>to cheer me up.
- Yes, it is.<br/>- No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Merry Christmas, Ted.
Merry Christmas.
So, kids, I settled in<br/>for a Christmas alone.
I appreciated that Ted wanted<br/>to cheer me up,
but honestly,<br/>it wasn't necessary.
So I can't have kids.
Big deal.
This way there's no one<br/>to hold me back in life,
no one to keep me<br/>from traveling
where I want to travel,
no one getting<br/>in the way of my career.
If you want to know<br/>the truth of it,
I'm glad you guys aren't real.
Really glad.
Damn it.
("Highway to Hell" by AC/DC<br/>playing)
Yes, it is.
Look, you don't want to<br/>tell me what's wrong, fine.
I don't need to know.
But you can never stop me<br/>from trying to cheer you up.
It's a fact of life.
You're just gonna<br/>have to deal with it.
Ted...
Hold on, hold on,<br/>this is the best part.

Kids, your Aunt Robin<br/>never became a pole-vaulter,
but she did become<br/>a famous journalist,
a successful businesswoman,<br/>a world traveler.
She was even briefly<br/>a bullfighter--
that's a funny story,<br/>I'll get to that one later.
But there's one thing<br/>your Aunt Robin never was.
She was never alone.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, on New Year's Day 2012,
Uncle Marshall took a trip<br/>to Minnesota
to see someone he truly missed.
Hey, Pop.
I can't believe<br/>it's been a year.
I think the most appropriate way
to honor your memory today...
is to get blasted
and watch the Vikings<br/>make the Bears
their furry little bitches.
- Go, Vikes!<br/>- Shh.
Sorry for your loss.
Which is what<br/>we'll be saying to the Bears
in about three hours,<br/>right, Pop?
Kids, tailgating<br/>at the Vikings-Bears game
was a tradition<br/>for Uncle Marshall and his dad.
That's how<br/>the government
covered up the UFO crash<br/>in Roswell:
by canning the sliced up<br/>alien carcasses
and calling it Spam.
a.k.a Sliced Processed Alien Meat
Wow.
Is there anything<br/>you don't know, Dad?
No.
I know most stuff.
And in your honor...
three decades of pork fat,<br/>lighter fluid and Bengay.
Dear God, that's the stuff.
So much to catch you up on.
So, last night<br/>was New Year's Eve.
That's a crazy story.
So you haven't told your dad<br/>that you're pregnant yet?
No. But why should I?
My dad has never<br/>been there for me.
This is just another chance<br/>for him to let me down.
Lily, you have to tell him.
He's at some board game<br/>convention in Chicago.
He's your dad.
I don't see why people<br/>aren't getting this.
Shoplifter<br/>does not promote crime.
It celebrates it.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Hey, Dad.
I'm, uh, calling with<br/>some pretty big news.
I'm pregnant.
Great. Thanks.
Anyway, Dad, Ted and Barney's, New Year's Eve
wasn't off<br/>to a great start, either.
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,<br/>whoa. It's 50 bucks,
and the line<br/>starts out there.
Uh, we're regulars.<br/>Oh, in that case,
the line starts out there,<br/>and it's 50 bucks.
You got a problem<br/>with that?
Kids, here's why we didn't have<br/>a problem with that.
And he was even scarier<br/>without the toupee.
No problem.<br/>It's a little drafty.
We'll get you<br/>a nice hot cocoa.
Check it out.
Sandy Rivers'<br/>New Year's Eve show.
Thank God<br/>I don't have to produce
this frozen pile<br/>of poo.
How'd you dodge<br/>that bullet?
Well, maybe Tina,<br/>the producer, he, uh, picked,
is more talented<br/>than I am...
at lying down while Sandy<br/>does his business on her.
Does it bother you<br/>that this pervert's
on the air,<br/>and you're not anymore?
Do you miss it?
What? Why would...<br/>why would I miss it?
No. I would rather
be warm and cozy<br/>here in denial-- my apartment.
Robin,<br/>I'm no therapist--
wait, yes, I am--
but I've got a New Year's<br/>resolution for you.
Get back on camera.
Mine was going to be "make<br/>a sex tape," so... two birds.
Hold that thought.
Hello?
Sandy?
Tina quit.
The woman I love just quit.
Love?<br/>She's my everything, Robin.
My sun, my stars, my oxygen.
Plus, she likes it<br/>fast and dirty,
and that's how Sandy rides.
I need you here ASAP.
Are you kidding me?
Marcus?
What the heck<br/>are you doing here?
What the heck are you<br/>doing here?
I wanted to see Dad today 'in private'.
Well, I had the same idea,
and I drove all the way<br/>from Mom's, so get lost.
I flew here, so you get lost.
Um, I'm trying to have<br/>a poignant moment
with our departed father,<br/>turd face.
Well, I'm trying<br/>to feel Dad's spirit
flow through my soul,<br/>butt breath.
I'm reaching out to the beyond
to touch Dad's inner light,<br/>ass clown.
I hear Dad's voice<br/>like an ethereal song
guiding me toward salvation,<br/>douche nozzle.
- Dibs on Dad.<br/>- Dibs on Dad times infinity.
Oh!<br/>Ooh.
I'll just pretend<br/>like you're not here.
What?
Dad, do you hear something?
Perhaps the high-pitched whine<br/>of someone who wet their bed
until they were 11!
Ten.
Anyway, Dad, since it's just<br/>the two of us...
Lily and I<br/>were going to spend New Year's
unpacking the baby room.
Um, sweetie, why<br/>is this book in here?
That's Enigmas of The Mystical.
It's all about<br/>mysterious
and unexplained phenomena.
Don't you remember the TV<br/>commercials from the '80s?
June 17th, 1983.
Tempe, Arizona.
A woman makes<br/>a chicken salad sandwich.
Chicken salad sandwich.
Halfway across the country<br/>in Michigan,
her daughter<br/>is compelled to make
almost exactly<br/>the same sandwich.
Tuna salad.
Coincidence?
Or an enigma of the mystical!
Yeah, those enigmas<br/>always seemed a bit thin to me.
Thin?<br/>Lily, this is 200 pages
of detailed accounts<br/>about Bigfoot, ghosts,
aliens abducting people from<br/>their beds and probing them.
I'm going to read it<br/>to Baby Eriksen
at night-night.
You really want<br/>to read our kid
bedtime stories about monsters?
First of all,<br/>I wouldn't use the "M" word.
Only they can call<br/>themselves that.
And secondly,<br/>are you really saying
you don't want to raise<br/>our child as a believer?
I don't want<br/>to brainwash our child
to believe in something<br/>with no proof.
It's not about proof;<br/>it's about faith.
Faith is what gives life<br/>shape and meaning.
I mean, if there aren't yetis<br/>or leprechauns,
what's the point of even<br/>getting up in the morning?
I don't know.
Wife, unborn child,<br/>drop a deuce?
Lily, don't you think<br/>it's a bit narcissistic
not to allow for something<br/>bigger than us out there?
Something whose<br/>beauty and power
and majesty humbles us?
God?<br/>Werewolves.
So, as the countdown<br/>to 212 continues,
a quick warning, America:
Tina Henderson<br/>is a soulless bitch
who will stomp on your heart.
I need you back, Tina.
I love you.
Well, if that's as bad<br/>as it gets, we might be okay.
Bathroom break.
Oh, good.
It's on the Jumbotron.
Oh, finally.
Yeah, that'll be<br/>100 bucks each.
What? You said 50.
That was before<br/>the place got crowded.
Okay? It's<br/>New Year's Eve.
People get rowdy<br/>and break stuff.
The cover protects us.
Plus, you get these<br/>festive hats.
For an additional<br/>15 bucks.
They're wet.
Dry ones are 20.
That's it.
Don't bother,<br/>everybody.
MacLaren's is a rip-off!
You'd all be better off
coming upstairs<br/>to my place for a beer.
Hey, dude. You serious?
Ted, do you remember<br/>a couple years ago,
we had the best idea<br/>of all time?
We should buy a bar.
Of course! We could buy a bar!
The name of<br/>our bar?
Puzzles.
People will be like,<br/>"Why is it called Puzzles?"
That's the puzzle.
A bar where no<br/>one's overcharged,
where everyone feels<br/>valued and respected.
A bar...
where we get chicks drunk<br/>and bang them.
We're opening<br/>Puzzles tonight.
Of course we're opening<br/>Puzzles tonight!
Aren't you going to ask us<br/>why it's called Puzzles?
Nope.
Okay.
Okay, we're back<br/>live in 30 seconds.
I don't know.
Uht's see if he's<br/>still wearing his mic.
Taxi, take me to Tina's house.
50 West 67th.
Sir, this is a falafel stand,
and you're sitting<br/>in the hummus
Okay.
Run the montage of people who<br/>died this year until I get back.
And add Sandy,
because when I find him,<br/>I'm going to kill him.
- Anyway, Dad...<br/>- Stop hogging Dad already.
- I've got stuff to tell him, too.<br/>- Like what?
You're still living with Mom,<br/>and you have no job.
Go ahead.
So, anyway...
July 8, 19.
Cheyenne, Wyoming.
A hunter spots<br/>a hairy form in the fore.
Bigfoot.
His story<br/>is dismissed
because, to be honest,<br/>he'd been drinking
and had a history<br/>of mental problems.
But was it a hoax?
Or was it an enigma of the...
It was an idiot<br/>in a gorilla suit.
Enigma.<br/>Gorilla suit.
Enigma!<br/>Gorilla suit!
Marshall? Marcus?
What are you guys doing he?
Having a private<br/>moment with Dad.
No, I'm having<br/>a private moment with Dad.
No, I'm having<br/>a private moment with Dad.
Touchdown, Vikings!
Boom! Yeah!
Anyway, Dad,
since it's still<br/>just the two of us,
I'll go on.
I've always envisioned Puzzles<br/>as a literary salon,
where Gotham's intelligentsia<br/>hold court
on art, philosophy<br/>and literature.
Great.
And while you're distracting<br/>the nerds and fatties,
I'll be in the VIP room<br/>getting it in.
Uh, yeah, dude,<br/>I don't know
where you got a velvet rope,<br/>but you can't
use my room<br/>for anonymous sex.
I'm kind of a neat freak<br/>that way.
Hey, guys, I have an idea<br/>for Puzzles.
What if... What?
Oh. Okay. I understand.
But he we like<br/>your energy.
How would you like<br/>to be our star bartender.
I've always wanted<br/>to be a bartender.
It's just like<br/>being a therapist.
You listen to people's problems,<br/>pretend to care,
but you can drink openly,
instead of having to hide<br/>your booze in a coffee mug.
Great. Oh,<br/>check it out.
We worked out<br/>a theme song for Puzzles.
While I was carrying<br/>100-pound kegs
up four flights of stairs?<br/>Awesome.
♪ ♪
♪ Puzzles is a place<br/>where people go ♪
♪ To feel like they belong ♪
♪ Gonna take advantage<br/>of dumb drunk girls ♪
No, we're not.
♪ That would be wrong ♪
♪ A place where wit<br/>and wisdom bloom ♪
♪A place to bang chicks<br/>in Ted's room ♪
- Not gonna happen.<br/>- We'll talk about it.
♪ At Puzzles,<br/>we all fit together ♪
♪ And I'm the bartender! ♪
I'll go get<br/>the other kegs.
Probably a good idea.
We got to work out<br/>some harmonies.
♪ And I'm right here ♪<br/>♪ No, you actually down here ♪
Excuse me, sir?<br/>About the TVs,
we in the middle<br/>burying my aunt, so...
Oh I'm sorry.<br/>We'll keep it down.
No, I just want<br/>to check out the score.
Actually, I'm trying to have
a private moment<br/>with my dad, so...
Oh.
It's just that I used to goto Vikes's
with my aunt;<br/>may she rest in peace.
Anyway, so back<br/>to my story.
She also loved burgers.
So now,<br/>back to my story.
Aunt Laura sure loved<br/>a toasted bun.
Tina, please tell me<br/>Sandy's here.
Don't worry, he's here.
And we're back...<br/>together!
He told me he loves me,<br/>he's sorry,
and I'm the only girl for him.
You know, since we'll here,
and we're all horny...
I don't know<br/>what went wrong.
Well, proposing the<br/>three-way was bad,
starting without us<br/>was worse,
finishing in the hallway was<br/>the nail in the coffin.
No! Stop drinking!
I gotta get you<br/>back on air!
But I'm single and<br/>ready to mingle!
Hello, there.
Oh, the Twitter-verse<br/>blowing up about
a new apartment-themed bar<br/>called Puzzles.
Why is it called<br/>Puzzles?
That's the puzzle!
Anyway, this VIP room<br/>has a maximum occupancy
of two people including me,<br/>so eeny...
and the rest<br/>of you may go.
It's funny,<br/>but it seems each time
I read James Joyce's Ulysses,
it's a different book,
begging the question:<br/>Has the book changed...
or have I?
Okay, people are getting rowdy<br/>and drunk and breaking things.
I know this goes against<br/>the Puzzles mission statement
you made me memorize, but we<br/>gotta raise our drink prices.
All right, just a little bit<br/>so no one will notice.
Boo!
Poodles sucks!
And that's when the night<br/>turned to absolute crap.
♪ At Puzzles,<br/>we all fit together ♪
♪ On sunny days<br/>or stormy weather ♪
♪ So pull up a chair and sit'♪
♪ To share and stories to tell ♪
♪ Puzzles is a place where<br/>everybody feels at home ♪
♪ And we bang chicks<br/>in Ted's room. ♪
What-what do, what do,<br/>what do we do?
And so Puzzles got a bouncer,
All right, you know what,<br/>you guys?
No. No, no, no, no, no,<br/>you said double
what MacLaren's<br/>was paying me.
And why isn't anyone wearing<br/>the hats I brought up?!
November 14th...
1982.
Everglades National Park,<br/>Florida.
Five mysterious lights dance<br/>in the night sky.
A ray shoots down,<br/>lifting the park ranger,
who, to be fair, was going<br/>through a bad divorce
and had a habit of lying<br/>to get attention.
I hate this job, Sandy!
I went into journalism<br/>to make a difference,
but you have made<br/>that impossible.
You know, to be honest,<br/>it hasn't been
an easy couple months for me.<br/>I've made mistakes.
I've felt alone.<br/>I had to let go of dreams
I didn't even know I had.
So here's the deal:
You're gonna get<br/>back on air
and count us<br/>into a better year,
because I just can't do<br/>2011 anymore. You with me?
He's not with me, is he?
Anyway, Dad, where was I?
You know what?<br/>Fine, get out of here!
We don't need ya!
And why doesn't anybody<br/>like these hats?
I made these hats.
It's because<br/>they' wet, Doug.
Why are they all wet?!
Were those our last customers?
Let me go check<br/>the bathroom.
You must be<br/>from the escort service.
The scenario is high school<br/>wrestling match.
Hello?
So get this:<br/>I lost Sandy Rivers.
Funny you should mention that.
It's almost midnight!
What am I gonna do,<br/>go on the air myself?
Listen... Wait. Yeah, do that!
No, I-I can't actually.
Yes, you can. It's what you<br/>really want and you deserve it.
Kevin, that's not how it works.
Sounds like that's<br/>your only choice.
New York's a big city.
Sandy Rivers<br/>could be anywhere.
And... wrestle!
Hey.
I'm sorry, baby.
I just...<br/>I want our kid
to believe that the<br/>universe is magical.
You know, like<br/>my dad taught me.
You know what<br/>my dad taught me?
Nothing...<br/>'cause he was never there.
June 22nd, 1996,<br/>Brooklyn, New York.
A man misses his daughter's<br/>high school graduation.
Later, she discovers<br/>her babysitting money
has been spent on<br/>a board game called
Who Stole The<br/>Babysitting Money?
He never saw<br/>the irony in that.
December 31st, 2011.
A woman calls her father<br/>to tell him she's pregnant.
says, 'Great. Thanks,'<br/>and hangs up on her.
And after pushing<br/>her to call him,
a Big Foot is discovered<br/>in her husband's mouth.
I'm glad you're<br/>a believer, baby,
but I'm never gonna believe<br/>in an "enigma of the mystical"
unless I see it<br/>with my own eyes.
Because the truth is,
my father never taught me<br/>believe in anything but myself.
Well, if it helps at all,<br/>I believe in you, too.
Then there's a pretty<br/>good chance I don't exist.
How dare you?!
Oh, my God!
This is Robin Scherbatsky<br/>filling in for Sandy Rivers.
You know, America,
tonight I've been groped,<br/>stepped in puke
and until 10 minutes ago
had no idea I would be<br/>on national television.
That's my girl.
But that's the magic<br/>of New Year's.
When that clock<br/>strikes midnight,
we all get a fresh start.
And I don't know about you,<br/>but I could really use one.
And that magic moment<br/>starts in ten...
nine...
That night became a turning<br/>point in Robin's career.
But we'll get to that.
They're nice hats, Doug.
They're wet<br/>but they're nice.
...three, two, one.
And that's the story<br/>of New Year's Eve.
You know, I've been thinking
that the reason I got so intense<br/>with Lily
about Enigmas of the Mystical<br/>is that, well...
Could you pass the pickles?
...with you gone, I feel<br/>the mystical a little less.
Can you hand me the chips?
Sometimes<br/>I feel you a little less.
That's why today was<br/>so important because I just...
I needed to...
Did you just open a beer<br/>on my father's headstone?
Actually, it's a hard cider.
And just as he was about<br/>to lose it...
Hey, Marvin, can you<br/>pass me a burger?
Hey, not Marvin. Marshall.
Sorry, it's just,<br/>you're so much like your pop.
Your Uncle Marshall<br/>thought back
to all those tailgates<br/>with his father.
Hey, mind if I grab one?
The more the merrier!<br/>All right.
♪ The time has come<br/>to heal our wounds ♪
♪ The time has come,<br/>it's coming soon...
And he realized that maybe<br/>private moments are overrated.
You know what?
The more the merrier.
Hey, guys.
♪ The time has come<br/>to heal the wounds. ♪
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
January 1st, 2012,<br/>East Meadow, New York.
A woman answers her door to<br/>find something more enigmatic
and mysterious than Bigfoot<br/>or the Loch Ness Monster.
Dad?
Hey.
I thought you were in Chicago.
I was.
Great. Thanks.
My daughter's having a baby!
Did you drive all night?
Yeah.
Well, Teddy and I<br/>split the drive.
This guy's a maniac<br/>behind the wheel.
Congrats, Princess.
Happy New Year, Dad.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Hey, guys.<br/>Where are Marshall and Lily?
Something terrible<br/>happened.
Are they okay?<br/>Are they in the hospital?
No.
Somewhere much... much worse.
Long Island!
Tonight, we're moving<br/>out there for good.
Yeah. Here are your spare<br/>keys to our new house.
Long Island?
I don't understand.
You can get spray tans here.
I never let myself
believe this day<br/>would really come.
It's like when<br/>they canceled
Party of Five<br/>for the second time.
I mean when they...<br/>canceled sports.
Guys, we'll still see<br/>each other all the time,
and we'll talk<br/>on the phone.
And I know people say<br/>that having kids means
you won't see your<br/>friends anymore, but...
Oh, God, this is<br/>good-bye, isn't it?
No. Stop it.
Guys, this doesn't
change anything.
We are only a 46-minute<br/>train ride away.
Just pop out
whenever you want.
So... I guess<br/>this seat is open.
I'll go get a chair.
So that's it.
No more Marshall.
No more Lily.
They're gone.
Which means...
no lame married couple
shooting down<br/>all my amazing ideas.
Guys, great news.
I'm the new leader<br/>of the gang!
Marshall and Lily were almost<br/>done decorating their new home.
I like it there much better.<br/>Yeah.
There was only one problem.
Wrong!
This can't go here.
Kids, when he found out<br/>she was pregnant,
Lily's estranged father
unexpectedly showed up<br/>on her doorstep.
It was a gesture<br/>she appreciated.
But after two weeks,<br/>they'd had just about enough.
That has to go there
to cover up<br/>the splintery floorboard.
And you can't hang
this picture here.
This isn't plaster;<br/>it's dried toothpaste.
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.
I grew up in this house.
I know it like<br/>the back of my hand.
And this lamp<br/>absolutely cannot be here.
Why not?
Blocks my view<br/>of the Widow Rodriguez
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.
Isn't she<br/>a little old, Dad?
Oh, you didn't see her<br/>when I was a kid.
In my mind, she'll always be 54.
I know he means well, but<br/>I can't take it anymore.
He won't leave,<br/>and-and he's acting
like this is his house.<br/>No, I know.
And these annoying notes<br/>he keeps leaving around?
"I need absolute silence<br/>when practicing the drums."
"Do not touch the fudge<br/>in my nightstand."
"We need ant traps<br/>for my nightstand."
I find myself<br/>hiding out here
just because it's the only room<br/>in the house
where he can't boss us around.
Great news.
I put new batteries<br/>in the old intercom system.
Now we can communicate<br/>at all times.
Mickey out.
Look at what's become<br/>of our booth.
Looks like my old<br/>shop teacher's hand--
just sort of<br/>missing something.
Enough!
I am sick of you two<br/>wallowing in sadness,
instead of doing<br/>the healthy thing
and pretending<br/>anyone who leaves you
never existed<br/>in the first place.
I hate to agree with Barney's
near-paralyzing<br/>abandonment issues,
but he has a point.
You can't just stop living
because two of your friends<br/>moved away.
Precisely.
Now, as new group leader,<br/>I say we go out and do something
that we never would have done<br/>with Marshall and Lily here.
Ooh.
Remember that amazing idea<br/>I had that one time?
Let's go to a strip club.<br/>Nope.
So what do you say?
Let's declare<br/>our independence
with an on-da-peen dance.
On-the-peen dance.
No, we got it.<br/>We got it.
Let's go to a strip club!
Well...
I'm going to miss<br/>them anywhere.
Might as well see some<br/>cans while I'm at it.
I'll take it!
Robin, Kevin, you in?
Kids, early in any<br/>relationship,
there's a phase where you don't<br/>say no to anything.
Because you want<br/>to seem interesting...
adventurous...
and open-minded.
I call it<br/>Early Relationship Chicken.
Well, I'm open<br/>to anything.
Oh, mos' def.
So...<br/>So...
I don't want to go<br/>to a strip club.
I don't want<br/>to go to a strip club.
But I don't want him<br/>to think I'm some prude.
Man, we've been saying "so"<br/>for a while.
Yeah!<br/>Yeah!
Yes!
Tonight is going<br/>to be legen--
Wait, are we sure it's a<br/>good idea to go to a strip club?
Shut up, Lily!<br/>I'm in charge now-- dary!
I've got no<br/>cell reception.
I wanted to call Ted.
This feels weird.
The last time I lived<br/>this far from him
was my semester abroad.
You never did a semester abroad.
That's what I called it<br/>when we lived
on opposite sides of campus.
Wrong!
Please tell me you're not<br/>plugging that in there.
Yes, Mickey,<br/>that's exactly what I'm doing.
All right, fine.<br/>I won't say anything.
It's... just that<br/>this was my room
when I growing up,
so I know it a little<br/>better than you.
Lot of great memories here.
Mostly just discovering my body.
That's it.
Mickey, since you got here,
you've been nothing<br/>but judgmental and pushy
and strangely obsessed<br/>with your adolescent sex life.
Tomorrow morning,
you're out of here.
Well, I-I've just been trying<br/>to help you...
We don't need your help!
I...
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.
It had to be done.
Too bad the one person
who could stop you<br/>from making mistakes like that
was told he has to move out<br/>next month.
Tomorrow!<br/>Tomorrow!
Would either of you<br/>like a dance?
I'm always ready to rock.
And I'm always ready to roll.
So...<br/>So...
I'm not ready to rock.
Rolling makes me dizzy.
Hell, yeah!<br/>Yeah!
I'm buying my man a lap dance,<br/>'cause that's just how I do!
Party like a<br/>rock star!
Party like a rock star...
Uh, hey, guys.
It's Ted.
Um... you're probably busy<br/>with the move still.
Um...
Give me a call<br/>if you want to gab.
Sorry about using<br/>the word "gab."
Ted, stop pining<br/>over Marshall and Lily.
Have some self-respect.
Now, put this fiver<br/>in your mouth so...
that stripper with the lazy eye<br/>can vacuum it up with...
Barney!<br/>Wh-what?
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?
They're my two best friends.
I'm your two best friends!
And we're here tonight
to show you there's no need<br/>to miss something
when you can replace it<br/>with something better.
Gentlemen, say hello<br/>to J-J-J-Jasmine!
Remember her?
- So, a while back, we discovered-
Lily had a doppelganger
who was a Russian stripper.
Look at her, Ted.
She's just like old,
less-good Lily,
but instead of<br/>bossing us around,
she shows us her boobs.
No touching.
Okay, a little<br/>bossing us around.
I call her Better Lily.
Hey, Better Lily, please<br/>dance for my friend.
Barney, I don't<br/>need a lap dance.
I need to talk<br/>to my friends.
Who says you<br/>can't do both?
Talk to her.<br/>She's got ears.
Yes, she does have ears.
You want to touch my<br/>girlfriend's boobs?
50 bucks.
Wait-- Better Lily<br/>is dating this behemoth?
Sound like anyone<br/>you know?
That's New Marshall.
This is our gang now.
Hey, guys, Ted again.
Starting to think<br/>you forgot about me.
Or replaced me<br/>with some cool neighbor.
What's his name?!
I'm totally kidding.
Anyway, uh...
just trying to remember<br/>what your faces look like.
Ted, when they serve alcohol<br/>at a strip club,
you're not allowed<br/>to show your vagina.
100 bucks, and you<br/>will see the world, my friend.
They're already<br/>ignoring my calls?
Look, I'm realistic.
I knew I'd have to get used<br/>to going to the dentist alone,
but I didn't think<br/>they'd cut me out completely.
If they don't
need us, we don't need them.
Yes! Finally!
By the way, did you see<br/>how she opened that bottle?
Whoa.
Lights out in the suburbs<br/>is... is really dark.
Where's the fuse box?
I don't know.
I know where it is.
Maybe I could fix it for you,<br/>if I wasn't so busy packing.
You know what?
I bet the fuse box<br/>is in the basement.
I'll just... I'll go<br/>find it myself.
How hard can it be?
As hard as that desk<br/>you just walked into?
Good burn, Mickey.
You deserve a little<br/>nightstand fudge for that one.
Where do I look?
I mean, I can't look<br/>at her chest.
Damn it! I just did.
Maybe Robin didn't notice.
Man, he's really up<br/>in those jugs.
Shake it, baby!
A playa's gotta play!
This is weird.
I'll just look her<br/>in the eyes.
Is he falling in love<br/>with this stripper?
Quick, do something cool.
Make it rain, son!
Money ain't no thang!
Damn it,<br/>there was a 20 in there.
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.
From the sound<br/>of the wind chimes,
I hear you've made it<br/>to the first floor.
Okay... you know what, Mickey?
You can save the creepy<br/>game master routine.
It's only kind of<br/>terrifying me.
Oh, but the game has just begun.
I call it "Try Not to Bang into<br/>All the Furniture and Stuff
on Your Way to the Fuse Box<br/>in the Basement, Marshall."
That's just a working title.
Hey!
Got a little boob glitter<br/>on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.
Straight pimpin'.
Barney, you got<br/>a little bit, too.
Where?
Did I get it?
Yeah, you got it.
Who needs Marshall<br/>and Lily?
We got a new gang,
and we're all going to<br/>hang out together forever.
My shift is done.
Good-bye.
Wait, stop!
Technically, this song's not<br/>over, so we still own you.
Plus we're best friends!
Where to next?
We go to underground<br/>poker game
in mostly-abandoned<br/>insane asylum.
Yes!
This is gonna be awesome,
and when it is, I want<br/>you all to remember
who led you there:<br/>Barney Stinson,
new group leader.
Yay!
I'm winning all<br/>your chippies!
Let's not drink<br/>when we're...
I'm thirsty; it's good.
It's good.
Marshall, I just remembered
I saw a box of matches<br/>in the drawer by the trash can.
Okay, thanks, baby.
Lily, I can't find them.
Looking for these?
Oh, right, you can't see me.
Um, well, I'm burning the<br/>matches you so desperately need.
Aah, ooh, ow!
Ow.
Hah! Oh!
Mickey... guess who found<br/>the basement stairs?
I'll be down<br/>at that fuse box in no time,
and when I get there,
I'm sure that I'll figure out<br/>how fuse boxes work,
so it'll be fine.
Hey, Marshall,
I know I've been<br/>messing with you,
but seriously,<br/>that second step, don't...
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.
Oh, my knee!
Ow!
And watch out for my drum set.
I win again!
I was bluffing.
I didn't even have enough cards.
Ted, please stop winning.
Hey, look, it's the<br/>New York City skyline.
♪ We built Chip City
Uh, uh!
♪ We built Chip City<br/>on all your dough ♪
♪ Built Chip City<br/>Hit it!
You know Butterfly-knife.
I'd expect this<br/>from Face Tattoo...
or Jagged Cheek Scar,
or Larry,
but not you.
Why don't I get nickname?
Because you have too<br/>many things, Larry.
You get one thing!
See, that's why<br/>you bring New Marshall.
We go to party in<br/>slaughterhouse.
You come?
Please, God, no.
Don't let me be in charge<br/>of the gang anymore.
I can't believe Dr. Kevin<br/>doesn't remember me
from our sessions<br/>three years ago.
Is that the lunatic
that stabbed<br/>all those prison guards?
We gotta hit that party!
I'll never find love.
We got to hit that party!
Sweet.
Lily?
I think we made a mistake<br/>moving out to the suburbs.
I miss our home.
I miss our booth<br/>with our friends.
And I'm pretty sure I have<br/>a drumstick...
somewhere bad.
Dad, why are you<br/>acting like this?
Well, I was just<br/>trying to be helpful,
but you guys want me out<br/>by the Fourth of July.
Tomorrow.
You know what<br/>a helpful father,
not to mention grandfather,<br/>might do?
Get these lights back on.
Okay, Marshall, listen up.
I'm gonna get you<br/>to that fuse box.
Can't you just come down here<br/>and do it for me, please?
I don't know anything<br/>about this house.
No, Marshall...
you don't know anything<br/>about your house.
All right, we got a lot<br/>of work to do.
Wait here,<br/>we get you
on VPI list for party.
You give us, uh,<br/>$200 per person.
Cover charge.
That's pretty steep<br/>for a cover charge.
Is very good party.
Is party for, uh, New York<br/>"Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.
Oh, my God.
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?
That sounds like a real thing.
Okay, now, Marshall,<br/>take three steps forward,
while ducking underneath<br/>the broken ceiling fan.
Now look to your left
and spit.
That's the water heater.
Want to stay away from that.
That baby is hotter than the<br/>Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.
Okay, now past the washer and<br/>dryer is the hardest part.
You're gonna have to belly-crawl<br/>underneath the ping-pong table
and don't so much as nudge it.
Why not?
Because there are<br/>900 dominos set up
in the shape of Barbara Eden.
Big, big I Dream Of Jeannie fan.
I'm clear.
I don't know what<br/>that sound is, Mickey.
That's the sound of Barbara<br/>Eden never banging me.
That's what that is.
Dad, get it back.
Come on.
Okay, Marshall,
take three steps forward,
and you should be<br/>at the fuse box.
Do you think he made it?
I did it!
No, Marshall...
you did it.
Fun fact: that night inspired
Mickey's one and only<br/>successful board game--
♪ With splintery floorboards<br/>and rusty nails ♪
♪ Make sure you don't<br/>get impaled ♪
♪ Lites Out!
Brought to you by Aldrin Games!
Well, judging from<br/>how many clients
that hooker has serviced,
I'd say we've been<br/>here almost an hour.
Ted, we've been robbed.
Better Lily and New Marshall<br/>would never rob us.
They're our best friends.
Damn it, Ted.
New Marshall is<br/>an escaped zoo bear
and the only thing that Better<br/>Lily is better at than our Lily
is over-the-pants hand stuff.
I'm assuming.
I'll admit it.
I can't lead this group.
We need Marshall and Lily.
But they're gone, aren't they?
I mean, it'll go from seeing<br/>them a couple times a week,
to a couple times a month,
and then it'll just<br/>be holiday parties.
Then the years pass,
and you find out<br/>Marshall's dead,
and you're there for Lily<br/>emotionally at first,
but then it becomes sexual,<br/>and you feel guilty,
but maybe that guilt just makes<br/>it dirtier and better...
No, I won't let that happen.
Especially that last part.
Look, I know I've been a little<br/>drunk and naive tonight,
but here's what's gonna happen.
First, we're gonna leave a note
for Better Lily and Arvydas,<br/>they're worriers.
Oh, buddy.<br/>Then,
we're gonna go see Only Marshall<br/>and One-Of-A-Kind Lily
because they're our best friends
and they're only<br/>46 minutes away.
Are you with me?
Kind of resent the power grab,<br/>but okay, let's go!
Hey,
do you want to come to<br/>Long Island with us?
Uh, well, still a few more<br/>hours before the sun comes up.
So...
No.<br/>No?
Is that bad?
No, it's great.
Ooh, that felt so good.
I hate doing things<br/>and going anywhere!
Oh, new experiences suck!
While we're at it,<br/>I hate high-fiving you!
I know.
We're adults who are<br/>sleeping together,
not teens pledging a frat.
Oh, man, I really<br/>liked the high-five.
The next morning, Marshall<br/>and Lily woke up to a surprise.
Hey, what are... what<br/>are you guys doing here?
Just wanted to make<br/>sure this key worked.
We missed you.
Give mama a hug.
Oh...
Don't check your voicemail.
Y-You might have<br/>a couple weird ones.
You hear this?!
This is the sound<br/>of me moving on.
Yeah, I'm a stripper.
Okay, who wants pancakes?
Which two of you want pancakes?
I'll make more.
Oh, good-good-good,<br/>'cause I want pancakes.
There you go.
Thank you, okay.
Enjoy them.
Hey, honey, look,
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.
Okay? I'll leave<br/>right after breakfast.
I'll crash with some friends.
Dad, you know what?
You can stay.
Oh, thank God.
I got no friends.
I'll be here two weeks, tops.
It wasn't two weeks.
Would the five<br/>of us always live
within a few minutes<br/>of that booth?
No, that's life, kids,<br/>but here's what I discovered.
Our booth was wherever<br/>the five of us were together.
That's right, Widow Rodriguez.
Stretch it.
Work those gams.
Ooh, yeah.
Grab that left arm.
Clutch that chest.
Fall down really fast.
Oh, my God!<br/>Somebody call 911!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">- Dad, we need to talk.<br/>- Is it about the bees?
Bees?<br/>We're throwing
a housewarming party<br/>in two weeks.
Oh.
It's gonna be friends,<br/>neighbors...
Did he say...<br/>did he say "bees"?
Yeah. Marshall's been working<br/>very long hours lately,
so I have been planning<br/>this whole party by myself,
and everything's in place:<br/>the food, the wine.
I even found a rare<br/>Gouda on the Internet.
Oh.
Getting back<br/>to these bees...
Bottom line: this party<br/>is very important to me,
so I can only assume--<br/>and I say this with love--
you're gonna ruin it.
Lily, I promise I won't ruin<br/>your party.
I'll be charming and convivial.
A regular Burt Reynolds.
You have absolutely nothing<br/>to worry about.
Tell us about the bees!
Well, all right,<br/>since you asked.
I'm starting up a business
cultivating all-organic,<br/>artisanal honey.
That's right,<br/>I'm a job creator.
Oh.<br/>So this party...
Oh, Lily, wait.<br/>Um, if you don't mind,
I just,<br/>I have one follow-up.
Where are you doing<br/>this exactly?
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees<br/>in the basement.
Why would you even say<br/>that?! It's the most ridic...
Happy housewarming!
Hey, guys.
Robin here has spent
all day learning<br/>how to make kugel.
Couldn't figure it out--<br/>this is from Zabar's.
Can we heat it up<br/>in your oven?
Faster than heating it up<br/>in the refrigerator.
I've had a few cocktails.
I got it.<br/>Take that.
Kids, someday<br/>you're gonna throw a party,
and you might find yourself<br/>worrying
if something's gonna go wrong.
Well, don't.
What you should worry about<br/>is everything going wrong.
And what's really scary<br/>is how quickly that can happen.
At Lily and Marshall's<br/>housewarming party
for instance,<br/>it only took five minutes.
Now, a lot happened<br/>in those five minutes.
You know what? I'm gonna take<br/>this room by room.
We'll start in the living room.
Oh, no,<br/>that's not what you want.
- What?<br/>- Oh, nothing. So, you think
this is going pretty well?
Baby, are you kidding?
You single-handedly pulled off<br/>the party of the year.
Oh, stop it.<br/>I used both hands.
So, what can I do to help?
Honey, this is your first night<br/>off in however long.
You just relax and keep knocking<br/>back those cocktails.
Mr. Cootes.
Hey, isn't it nice<br/>to finally have a night off?
It is.<br/>But tonight is not that night.
We're going back to the office<br/>in 45 minutes.
But, sir, this is<br/>our housewarming party.
You know,<br/>Mother Earth is also having
a "housewarming" party, too,
only hers ends with humankind<br/>at the bottom of a rising ocean,
passing through the digestive<br/>tract of a stingray.
By the way,<br/>it's a lovely home.
Mr. Cootes,<br/>I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,
I got some vegan spring rolls<br/>for you over there.
Oh, nummies!
You're going<br/>back to work?
Sheez, Marshall,<br/>you are as busy as a...
Oh, gosh,<br/>what are you as busy as?
Please don't talk about<br/>the bees.
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.
That guy is in everything.
Let's just put on some music.
♪
I'll, uh, I'll bring out<br/>the Gouda,
we'll open a couple bottles<br/>of wine...
that are in the basement.
All right, I'll get<br/>my beekeeper's suit.
You should be happy<br/>about the bees.
They're keeping<br/>the mice at bay.
We have mice?
Not with all these bees
flying around, we don't.
You're welcome.
Ted, baby Gouda's<br/>coming out. Look alive.
Are you a vegan?
What?
Ooh-ee!
Kitchen, now.
I can't believe that he's<br/>making us go to work tonight.
Are... you... a... vegan?
Um, no.
Uh-huh.<br/>And when you were shoveling
the spring rolls down your<br/>gullet, did you happen to notice
a little sign next<br/>to the plate marked "Vegan"?
I think there's<br/>been some mistake.
You could have had anything<br/>on that table!
Anything at all!
Mini pizzas,<br/>bacon-wrapped figs,
pigs in blankets.
There was even talk<br/>of an inbound Gouda!
But no, no, you had to have<br/>the one thing
that someone with my dietary<br/>preferences can eat.
Look, I didn't eat<br/>the spring rolls.
Liar!
Your breath reeks of shredded<br/>carrots and deceit!
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat<br/>your precious spring rolls.
Oh...
What are you gonna do<br/>about it, hippie?
It's fine.<br/>Everything's fine.
Young man,
are you suggesting<br/>fisticuffs...
as in with our fists?
And feet--<br/>I'm a kicker.
Well, well, looks like<br/>I just started eating
white meat again.
I will bite and scratch<br/>you like a wolverine.
May I warn you,
I have been in<br/>a fight before.
So have I... sort of.
Oh, God.
Mr. Cootes. Hi.
Did you see that we had<br/>hummus and veggies?
There's hummus and veggies?
Over there.
Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy<br/>push me around.
I believe it was Sun Tzu<br/>who wrote, "Never give up.
Never surrender."
Shut up, Ted.<br/>Okay.
For God's sake, Lily,<br/>you're pregnant.
For God's sake, Ted,<br/>Lily's pregnant.
Oh, man.
Sorry about that.
I don't need<br/>this right now, Ted.
I shouldn't do this.
- I shouldn't do this.<br/>- What?
This is a bad idea.<br/>This is a bad idea!
- What is?<br/>- I should just go. I should just go!
Okay, okay, just tell me<br/>what is going on.
I love my penis, Robin.
Oh, Barney, you promised.
I do! I love it!
If I could kiss it, I would.
I'd be lying if I told you<br/>I hadn't tried.
I'm not comfortable<br/>with this conversation.
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my<br/>penis we're talking about.
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent.<br/>- She?
Every penis is a girl, Robin.<br/>Everyone knows that.
Like... ships and lake monsters.
And Gouda!
She's a beauta.
Oh, Gouda.
Well, I'll be back.
Most of me, anyway.
- Don't eat that.<br/>- What?
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.
It's not ruined.<br/>Ten second rule.
Eight, nine, ten,<br/>and it's ruined.
This whole party's<br/>ruined.
I got a basement<br/>full of bees,
and Ted almost got into a fight<br/>with Mr. Cootes.
Lily, look around.
Everyone's having<br/>an amazing time.
It's a great party.
Okay, maybe it's not<br/>a total disaster.
What the hell was that?!
So that's what happened<br/>in the living room.
Now I'm gonna tell you what<br/>happened in the dining room.
Oh, no, that's not<br/>what you want.
Man, I can't believe<br/>these are vegan.
I've had, like, 20 of 'em.
I should get the name<br/>of this caterer.
It's my kitten's<br/>Bat Mitzvah next week.
She's finally<br/>becoming a cat.
Oh, God, you are crazy.
About cats.
Cats are so honest and real<br/>with their affections.
Ever since my divorce,
it's just been one liar<br/>after another.
That's why it's so refreshing<br/>to meet someone honest like you,
Special Agent Gary Powers.
Listen...
I think we can agree<br/>there's something here.
Something big...
that looks<br/>and probably feels real.
Maybe...
we can go back<br/>to your place.
I can't ask you to delay<br/>intercepting those asteroids.
I do need to intercept<br/>those asteroids.
I think we need<br/>to have sex right now.
Meet me in the upstairs guest<br/>bedroom in two minutes.
I'm just looking<br/>for the vegan spring rolls.
Last one, sorry.
Two minutes.
How can they all be gone?<br/>The party just started.
I know, right?
Let's just put on<br/>some music.
♪
I'll, uh, I'll bring out<br/>the Gouda,
we'll open a couple of bottles<br/>of wine...
that are in the basement.
Some jerk was just here.
And he was all, like,
"I can't believe<br/>these are vegan.
I've had, like, 20 of 'em."
Point me into the direction<br/>of this scoundrel.
Um... it was<br/>that guy.
Ted, baby Gouda's<br/>coming out. Look alive.
Lily, these spring rolls...<br/>ooh-ee!
Kitchen, now.
I can't believe that he's<br/>making us go to work tonight.
I mean, I think it's time<br/>that somebody took him aside
and told him this is not<br/>how you treat your staff.
Well, I'm sort of busy<br/>with the party right now.
Fine. I'll do it myself.<br/>But he's gonna scream at me,
and you know that I can't<br/>stand up to screaming.
Just go talk to him!<br/>I think I should go talk to him.
Barney...<br/>Ah, Lily,
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.
You could have had<br/>anything on that table!
Mini pizzas,<br/>bacon-wrapped figs,
pigs in blankets.
There was even talk<br/>of an inbound Gouda!
Robin. Okay, listen,<br/>I need your help.
I'm about to get in<br/>a screaming match with my boss,
and I'm not good at getting<br/>screamed at,
so I need you to warm me up.
How?<br/>I want you to scream at me.
You know, like you do<br/>to strangers on the street
at the slightest provocation.
I don't do that.
Come on, lay some of that<br/>classic Scherbatsky
mean son of a bitch on me.
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout<br/>trying to sell you cookies.
Four dollars a box<br/>and you're out of Thin Mints?!
You green little...!<br/>I don't do that!
Come on, scream at me.
Like that.
It's fine.<br/>Everything's fine.
Marshall, there is plenty<br/>of stuff
that I don't get mad about,
like the fact that you're<br/>serving pigs in blankets
without hot mustard.
I'm not the type of person<br/>to be driven crazy by a host
who refuses to provide<br/>delicious hot mustard
in which to dip<br/>my pigs in blankets!
I'm the type of girl who...<br/>keeps her cool.
Who keeps her cool.
Wait. Whoa, baby,<br/>are you okay?
Of course.<br/>This party is great.
I am handling this.<br/>Oh, God.
No...
Hummus and veggies?
I'm looking for<br/>hummus and veggies.
Robin, can I talk to you about<br/>something very dear to me?
Promise me this isn't<br/>about your penis.
I promise it isn't<br/>about my penis.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir, could I talk<br/>to you in the kitchen?
Sorry about that.
I don't need this<br/>right now, Ted.
I swear, if there's<br/>one more crisis...
Well, the bees<br/>escaped their enclosure,
but no reason<br/>to "bee" concerned.
No, there is,<br/>we're in big trouble.
What is that smell?
Oh, I doused my suit<br/>with kerosene.
All beekeepers do this.
Dad, just take off<br/>the suit right now.
All right, fine.
Every 30 seconds,
there's another crisis<br/>that needs to be dealt with
and I have<br/>to deal with it.
This is... Oh, God.
This is parenthood, isn't it?
So they say.
Okay, it's official.
I thought I could do it,<br/>but I can't.
No, Marshall's always at work.
He's got to go back tonight.
And I don't know<br/>if I can handle a life
that's just one crisis<br/>after another.
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna<br/>give you a little piece of...
Gouda!
God.
Crisis?<br/>Crisis.
- Don't eat that. Whoops!<br/>- What?
Gouda's out, Ted.<br/>Don't sleep on the Gouda.
Wouldn't dream of it.
So Lily told me you have to go<br/>back to work tonight?
No, I don't have to go<br/>back to work tonight.
Mr. Cootes and I<br/>came to an understanding.
But, hey, what's going on<br/>with Robin?
I called her<br/>a mean son of a bitch
and she took it all weird.
- She did?<br/>- Yeah.
Crazy, right?
Hey, buddy.
Best housewarming<br/>party ever.
Everybody's abuzz.
Abuzz.
Oh, good one, Mickey.
But, hey, you're right.
Great party.
What the hell<br/>was that?!
And that's what happened<br/>in the dining room.
Now I'm gonna tell you<br/>what happened in the kitchen.
Oh, no, that's not<br/>what you want.
Man, I can't believe<br/>these are vegan.
Back to our fight?
Back to our fight.
I cannot believe you screamed<br/>at that woman at Zabar's.
She was trying to cut in line.
She was gonna get<br/>the last kugel.
She was 90 years old.
It was probably gonna be<br/>her last kugel.
Sometimes in life,<br/>you have to be assertive
and stand up for yourself.
You called her a whore.
Who wears that much makeup?!
Old ladies!
Who take money for sex. Exactly.
Look, I'm sorry.
If I would've left things<br/>in your dainty, lily-white,
never-ripped-<br/>an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,
we would be kugel-free<br/>right now.
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?
You never stand up for yourself.
Remember that sixth grader<br/>who kept stealing your lunch?
High school was<br/>a tough time for me, okay?
And that girl was muscular.
Forearms like Popeye.
How do you even know about that?
Marshall told me.<br/>He also said that
you had your mom stop making
peanut butter<br/>and jelly sandwiches
because of that girl's<br/>nut allergy.
I didn't want to add<br/>to her health problems.
She was already in a wheelchair.
Okay, so what?
I would rather be nice<br/>than be like you,
always getting in fights<br/>about stuff
that's not even worth<br/>fighting about.
Disagree.
It's like Sun Tzu wrote<br/>in The Art of War,
"Never give up.<br/>Never surrender."
That was Tim Allen<br/>in Galaxy Quest.
Whatever, dude.
Your problem is any time<br/>you're faced with
the least bit of confrontation,<br/>you run away.
Oh, I run away<br/>from confrontation?
Ted, baby Gouda's<br/>coming out.
Look alive.
Whoops.<br/>Son of a...!
I'm sorry.
Maybe that was my fault.
You think?
You're right in my snack track.
Hey, nice<br/>beekeeper suit.
Do you know that, uh,<br/>most bees are left-handed?
Did you know bees hate<br/>the smell of kerosene?
I knew that.<br/>Geez, what do you think,
this is my first day<br/>as a beekeeper?
Nice. Oh.
Is that true about<br/>bees and kerosene?
I don't know.
Barney...
Ah, Lily,
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.
Barney, that woman<br/>you were talking to,
our neighbor Geraldine,
some guy<br/>slept with her
and didn't call her,<br/>so she hunted him down
and cut off a certain part of<br/>his anatomy with a cheese knife.
So, whatever you do,
don't sleep with her.
It's funny, she is,<br/>um, waiting for me
in the guest bedroom right now.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
That was the idea,<br/>but now forget it!
Barney, this is a disaster.
I swear, if there<br/>is one...
It's fine. Everything's fine.
Hey, ten second<br/>rule, right?
It's fine.<br/>Everything's fine.
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
I know you're pregnant, but<br/>you need a glass of wine.
I got that cheese off<br/>the Internet.
I know you got it<br/>off the Internet.
Why does that<br/>make it impressive?
You know what else you can find<br/>on the Internet?
Zoo animals masturbating.
There's one of a walrus.
He's...
Oh.
No...
Excuse me, sir, could I talk<br/>to you in the kitchen?
Mr. Cootes, I am not<br/>going back to work tonight.
Oh, no, she didn't<br/>just say that.
Mickey, could we just<br/>have a minute?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Marshall, look, I know<br/>when you started with this firm,
it was all fun and games.
The office chair races<br/>were particularly spirited.
Until, of course,<br/>Gail went down the stairs.
But for one brief moment,
boy, did she fly.
I'm not here, I'm not here.
Mr. Cootes, you're working<br/>yourself to death.
Just cut loose a little.
Have a beer, find a hobby.
Look, son, it's very simple.
Um, Mother Earth<br/>doesn't get a night off.
Neither do you.
Well, then I quit.
And I don't know<br/>if I can handle a life
that's just one crisis<br/>after another.
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna<br/>give you a little piece of...
Gouda!
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I do<br/>need a hobby.
Well, hey,<br/>how about beekeeping?
Me? No. I-I don't know the<br/>first thing about bees.
You want to know a secret?
Neither do I.
It's not a secret.
Let me try this thing on.
I'm gonna give you<br/>some privacy.
All right, thank you.
Okay.
Hey, buddy.
Best housewarming<br/>party ever.
Everybody's abuzz.
Okay, maybe it's not<br/>a total disaster.
Great party.
Oh, my God. Oh!
Oh, Mr. Cootes!
Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!
That was amazing!
Did you see me?!
I flew through the air<br/>like a human fireball
and didn't get a scratch.
Eat your heart out, Gail!
God, I feel so alive!
I want to drink a beer.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, one beer, coming right up.
Oh, and, uh, Marshall,
I think we'll take<br/>the night off tonight, okay?
Sounds good, yeah.
But I'll see you Monday?
Of course.
Yeah.
You know, Robin, I've<br/>been thinking about it.
Guess it's kind of nice<br/>you're such a badass.
It's pretty badass<br/>you're so nice, Ted.
Was I supposed to close<br/>the basement door?
God, this feels<br/>so right!
We're so great together.
I want to spend every minute<br/>of every day with you.
I never let you out of<br/>my sight for one second.
Not one second, not<br/>one second. I don't!
Oh, God!
My last lover was not like this.
He was the worst!
Do you know, he didn't even<br/>come to my cat's bris.
I mean, what?
Well, we showed him.
Yes, we did.
Let's just say, the<br/>punishment fit the crime.
I can't wait to<br/>tell everybody
that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!
Let's do it tonight.
No, it's Lily and<br/>Marshall's party.
We'll wait.
We can do it at Mittens<br/>and Mr. Pepper's wedding.
Or maybe something...

Top ten things Marshall<br/>said on his wedding night.
Whoa! It was small, but<br/>I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said<br/>on her wedding night.
Stop laughing<br/>at it, Lily.
Top ten things Marshall said<br/>on his wedding night!
Can we please talk<br/>about something
other than my wedding night?
Absolutely. Let's talk<br/>about last night.
It was a night<br/>like any other.
I was just about<br/>to get laid...
Hey, Barney,<br/>I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to<br/>is meeting her friend
at a club,<br/>so I need a wingman.
Well, just so you know, I'd be<br/>giving up a sure thing here.
Hey!
Are you not a sure thing?
Yeah, I am.
This "friend" of yours<br/>better be even hotter
and dumber than this one.
Wow! You have Enormous<br/>Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.<br/>Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S.:<br/>lack of awareness.
That's why I'm<br/>organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course, many of us<br/>will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people<br/>just stare at me
like I'm some kind of freak<br/>in reinforced underwear.
Poor, baby.
I can't imagine<br/>what you're going through
because I never wear underwear.
Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know. This is all<br/>moving kind of fast. Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called: I'm Not<br/>a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General,<br/>I've got to say,
I don't think<br/>that's the real thing.
Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups<br/>for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet,<br/>anyway?
No, we're not doing<br/>that first date dance
where you pretend everything<br/>I say is fascinating,
thinking it'll somehow<br/>get you into my pants.
What? Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?<br/>Fascinating!
What else<br/>are you allergic to, huh?
You owe me three hours<br/>for last night, Mosby.
I'm thinking,
laser tag tournament<br/>in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for<br/>under 18, right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall, we should<br/>get going. Any later,
and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.<br/>Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train<br/>of the night
back to Long Island.<br/>It's a mess.
Just a bunch of drunk,
sloppy idiots, fresh off a<br/>night of partying in the city,
just desperate to hook up<br/>with anything that moves.
Yeah.<br/>Bye.
See you.
New plan, Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know, a backwards baseball<br/>cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
- For Valentine's weekend,<br/>Lily and Marshall invited
Kevin and Robin on a couple's<br/>getaway to Vermont.
Mmm.
16 years together,<br/>and still so in love.
- Mm.<br/>- What's your secret?
The key to relationships is<br/>understanding the difference
between hearing<br/>and listening.
It's about respecting<br/>your partner's...
Opinions on...
Hey, shh, shh, shh.<br/>Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are<br/>a give and take,
and that's why it's important<br/>to never keep score.
Yeah, like how
Barney's holding<br/>these three hours
over Ted's head.
If they were a couple,<br/>they'd never work.
Obviously. Ted's a Taurus,<br/>and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.<br/>Don't keep score.
They're not even<br/>close to finished.
How do we not keep<br/>score, you ask?
Huh. Hm.
Sounds like somebody want<br/>to hear some examples, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna close my<br/>eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said<br/>on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's<br/>mom comes to visit us,
we have to put out all<br/>the tacky Minnesota gifts
she's bought us over the years.
Hi, Mom!<br/>Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
Uh-huh. I don't see
the gopher-hair tea cozy<br/>I made you.
Guess it wasn't<br/>good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold<br/>that over Marshall,
because if I did,<br/>he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never<br/>hold it over you
for dragging me to that<br/>experimental theater piece.
Is it... is it<br/>just screaming?
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha, loud and clear.<br/>Don't keep score.
Because if we did, then<br/>Marshall would owe me
for killing my<br/>cousin's dog.
How did I know<br/>that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled<br/>with chocolate?!
So we're back<br/>to this argument!
That night, Barney<br/>and I found ourselves
in a strange,<br/>new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Hey!
Where has this heavenly vehicle<br/>been all my life?
Can you hear<br/>its inspiring chant, Ted?
I think I can get laid,<br/>I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine<br/>with Wood,
The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh, I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted, that is a children's book.
Okay, as fun as this<br/>place is, it's late.
So, what's our play?
And don't say, "The<br/>Siamese Twins""
We're not stretching out<br/>another one of my jackets.
No, dude, this is<br/>the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back,<br/>play it cool,
scope out the hotties,<br/>and by the end of the line,
we will totally be<br/>sleeping with someone.
You know,<br/>you are so great.
You sat there listening<br/>to Marshall and Lily
bicker all night,<br/>and you didn't complain once.
Well, I am a therapist,<br/>so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful<br/>medications that might help.
Lily can't take anything;<br/>she's pregnant.
I meant for us.
If we're getting through<br/>five more meals
and a sleigh ride<br/>with those guys,
we need to be spaced out<br/>of our gourds.
Well, if we are keeping score,
I owe you one weekend, mister.
I was thinking<br/>a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin, will you marry me?
Look, I know this is fast.
I'm just excited<br/>to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
Wow.
Um...
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just, um...<br/>I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um, take as much time<br/>as you need.
I'll just, uh... I'll just keep<br/>this here until you're ready.
Any chance we could put<br/>that bad boy away for now?
It's really just staring<br/>at us, isn't it?
Ted! Ted! Ted!
I thought of some new<br/>great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
Uh-huh.
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
Thomas the Spank Engine!<br/>I said that one yesterday.
I don't think you did.
Wow. Someone's had some coffee.
Yeah. 18 cups!
There is no way<br/>I'm falling asleep tonight!
That Quinn girl is so wrong.
She said I could never<br/>love anything,
but I love this train!
She said you could never<br/>love anything? That's intense.
Oh, you have no idea.
Stop staring.<br/>Not gonna happen.
Is there any way we can start<br/>over and get to know each other?
I already know you.<br/>Oh, really?
- You wear a suit all the time.<br/>- Obviously.
You have a stupid rule<br/>about everything.
I pay for the meal,<br/>you handle my deal.
That's just good manners.
But you end most nights<br/>alone at a strip club,
feeling empty inside,<br/>telling yourself
your life is somehow epic<br/>or classic or... legendary.
I never say epic or classic.
Do you practice the dark arts?
No, they did not<br/>forget the potato salad
in your takeout order!
Wh-What happened next?!
For the last time, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Your debt is paid.
You don't have to come<br/>on the Drunk Train anymore.
You're never gonna meet<br/>the one there, anyway.
- Oh, screw the one!<br/>- What?
Every date I've been on lately<br/>has been brutal.
Last week, I went out<br/>with a girl
whose favorite band was Glee.
Plus, it's almost<br/>Valentine's Day,
and I'm alone without<br/>anything close to a girlfriend.
So... all aboard!
I have never been more proud<br/>of you.
Come on.
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic--
wait for it-- dary! Wait.
No, that's not it.
How do I usually say it?<br/>I hate this Quinn girl!
Well,
I propose we order<br/>a bottle of wine.
- Propose!<br/>- Not propose. Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.<br/>Lily, take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the...<br/>onion rings?
I mean, diamond rings.
I mean,<br/>diamond circles.
I mean, onion circles.
I know they're fattening,
but I hear this place<br/>has great onion circles.
So, Robin,<br/>about not telling them?
The green salad<br/>looks interesting.
You're so much better<br/>without him.
If you ask me,<br/>Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey, don't you dare<br/>badmouth Vinnie!
Ow!
So what do you do?
Well, I teach architecture,<br/>and I also...
Oh, big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What...
So... where do you live?
I'm on the<br/>Upper West Side.
Oh, big man.<br/>Living in Manhattan.
What, you think you're<br/>better than me?
Ehhh!
Ehhhh!
You think you're<br/>better than me?!
Well, it's a close one.
Lily made 14 awkward<br/>references to marriage,
and Marshall made an even 60.
I'm so sorry, Kevin.
It's okay. I'm gonna<br/>go to bed, but
you guys think tomorrow we can<br/>stop with all the marriage talk?
I do.<br/>I do.
That's a half a point each.
See you in a minute.
Okay.
So?
Are you any closer to deciding?<br/>Ooh...
Uh... well, there is something<br/>you don't know.
Um...
Can you guys keep a secret?
Yeah.<br/>Well, some of us can.
Well, there's something
I have been keeping<br/>from everyone
for the last couple of months.
Um...
I found out that<br/>I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.<br/>- Yeah.
Are you okay?
I can't believe<br/>that we didn't know.
No, you know,<br/>I've had some...
time to deal with this<br/>by myself, and...
I'm okay.
For real.
Are you sure?
Yeah. So...
even though I love Kevin
and I... think<br/>I want to say yes,
I can't until I tell him.
But I'm scared
it'll end our relationship.
You<br/>know what, Robin?
If it's meant to be,<br/>then it won't matter.
Yeah, you just<br/>have to tell him.
Thank God we had the keys<br/>to Marshall and Lily's place.
Pretty sure I told you that before<br/>you kicked in that side window.
You mean, before the "burglars"<br/>kicked in that side window
and stole all<br/>of Lily's underwear.
What the hell happened<br/>on that train?
It was absolute chaos.
Ted, when I was at M.I.T.,<br/>my favorite Einstein quote was:
"God doesn't play dice<br/>with the universe."
You didn't go to M.I.T.
I didn't?
Huh. I actually have no idea<br/>where you went to college.
Who are you?
If we analyze the seemingly<br/>random patterns of the train,
taking into account<br/>standard deviation,
and assuming that<br/>epsilon approaches zero
as angle delta approaches pi,
we can conclude...
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some<br/>sweet word play about logarithms
and getting into a rhythm<br/>with my log.
I'll remember it.
The next morning, Robin<br/>mustered up all her courage
and finally told Kevin<br/>her secret.
I know that this is a<br/>lot to process, so...
you take all the<br/>time you need.
And I understand...<br/>Robin...
will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train<br/>is 73 miles per hour,
and you factor in an aggregate<br/>of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable,
and you divide that...<br/>No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...<br/>it's been
right in front of us<br/>the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first<br/>word search.
So my Mom's already<br/>picked a date, venue
and caterer for<br/>the wedding.
But nothing's<br/>set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got<br/>a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay
with everything<br/>that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways<br/>to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just<br/>that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want<br/>to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care<br/>of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes
for my swollen feet. Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby,<br/>our baby.
So you're officially ahead<br/>of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents,<br/>we have to be a team. Deal?
It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight<br/>hours yesterday!
Two of those hours<br/>were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope<br/>it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
Deal. We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like<br/>I'm from Ronkonkoma?!"
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man<br/>with a briefcase!
What do you think,<br/>you're better than me?!
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.<br/>Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?<br/>Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out<br/>all the stops
and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens."
What's going on?
Wait. Did that Quinn girl shake<br/>your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know,<br/>I went out tonight
looking for a cheap,<br/>meaningless fling.
But you turned out<br/>to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this<br/>friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing<br/>to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously<br/>contemplating purchasing
a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this: You<br/>stood by your boy all night,
even though you have no chance<br/>of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect,<br/>I think that was the moment
you decided to come back<br/>to my place and get nasty.
Yeah, right.
Get up. You're on my bra.
Sorry.
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like<br/>I would remember
you two being naked on your<br/>couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right. That was later in my<br/>apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go<br/>to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.<br/>You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending<br/>the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.<br/>I...
That's why you can't stop<br/>"complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked<br/>our chance with these...
lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care<br/>where we go,
but I hate doing it<br/>on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train<br/>on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing<br/>better to do.
No one I can't stop<br/>thinking about.
So if you feel something<br/>for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting<br/>your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you,
but please don't<br/>just be the nice guy
who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you<br/>no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn<br/>into a big fat fattie.
See? Right there.
Don't always say<br/>the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload
of new information<br/>dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids<br/>aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love<br/>with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always<br/>had kids in it.
That is something huge you<br/>would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could<br/>ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...<br/>wake up in-in a year
or ten or 50, full of regret.
So... I need you<br/>to be sure, okay?
If we get married,<br/>you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing<br/>the fun run, the silent auction,
the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me<br/>out up here.
Why? You got a girlfriend<br/>or something?
Maybe something.
Kids, sometimes you realize
the journey you've been taking<br/>has reached its final stop.
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now,<br/>we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends<br/>will move away ♪
♪ And they're going<br/>to better places ♪
♪ But our friends<br/>will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I... I-I know<br/>it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready<br/>for something serious.
He seemed like the guy<br/>to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
I could.
I love you, Robin.
You've been complaining<br/>about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think<br/>that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown--<br/>check plus.
But like him? Ugh. Please.
I'm just surprised<br/>he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, I'll never forget<br/>the first time
I told your mother I loved her.
It was a rainy day in New York.
We just had a horrible lunch.
The movie we wanted to see<br/>was sold out,
and I just looked at her
and said, "I love you."
It was a big deal for me.
I hadn't said that<br/>to a girl since...
I love you, Robin.
I'm serious.
Do you remember why we<br/>broke up in the first place?
We asked each other,<br/>"Where do you want
to be in five years?"
And our answers<br/>were just too different.
Well, it's<br/>five years later,
and where are we?
Standing on the roof
where I kissed you<br/>for the first time.
I know this is<br/>a lot to process,
so no pressure here.
Just... what do you think?
You know what?<br/>You're exhausted, it's late.
Let's just go to sleep.
Well, good night.
What the hell was that?
Okay, I can fix this.
I-I was just temporarily insane<br/>because of my Lyme disease,
which I got on a camping trip<br/>that I didn't tell her about
because... I go camping<br/>in secret.
Perfect.
Or I could say, "I'm sorry,<br/>we're great as friends.
Let's just forget<br/>I ever said anything."
Yeah, that's probably better.
Okay, here goes.
I go camping in secret.
Wow, Ted, I...<br/>wow, okay.
You got to give<br/>me a minute here.
Yeah, of course.
Okay, um, we need to<br/>t-talk about this.
This time yesterday,<br/>I was in Vermont
engaged to another man.
I mean, it's been 24 hours<br/>of emotional mayhem,
and, and the day<br/>is still not over.
I mean, I swear<br/>to God,
if there's any more surprises,<br/>I'm gonna hit someone!
... comrade.
That means,
"Hello, coworker."
You ready for our trip<br/>to Mother Russia?
Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin<br/>was thrilled World Wide News
asked her to go to Moscow<br/>to cover Maslenitsa.
She was less thrilled<br/>to discover
Maslenitsa is the city's<br/>annual butter festival.
Even worse, she'd spend<br/>an entire week with all those
buttery Russians<br/>and her archenemy Patrice.
Uh, our flight leaves<br/>at 9:00 p.m., not a.m.
God... Patrice!
But, Robin,<br/>the schedule says 9:00 a.m.
and my ticket says 9:00 a.m.
and all the e-mail reminders<br/>said 9:00 a.m.
and our boss in the car<br/>downstairs said...
Okay, Patrice, I get it!
Oh, no!
Pair of pants<br/>coming in hot!
Noise-canceling<br/>headphones.
Oh, I don't need 'em.
It's a ten-hour flight and<br/>your sitting next to Patrice.
Oh, God,<br/>where's my cough syrup?
You're gonna make it.
I'll bring<br/>your bag down.
Where are my shoes?<br/>Where are my shoes?!
Don't worry. It's fine.
And look, about all this...<br/>Just go.
Good-bye.<br/>Bye.
Why didn't I kiss her?
We'll continue this<br/>when I get back.
Hello.
I know it's early,
but can you meet me<br/>at the bar right now, alone?
I'm on my way.
I got to meet Ted<br/>at the bar.
It's 7:00 a.m.
Man, Ted really needs to work<br/>on his boundaries.
Shh, guys, seriously.
Why are you in our bed?
I took the drunk train<br/>and got stuck out here.
Oh, God, I am so hungover.
Oh, God,<br/>Lily's not wearing a bra!
Shh!
Bye, baby.
Do you think...?
Okay, I already know<br/>I don't want to hear this.
Do you think<br/>that if we did it...
Yeah, I was right.<br/>I don't want to hear this.
...and I did<br/>a really good job...
Please leave.
...that I could turn that<br/>into my baby?
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Morning sickness?<br/>No.
It's crazy, right?
Are you shocked?
No, I'm not shocked.<br/>You're in love with Robin.
Do you remember back
at Christmas when she was upset,<br/>you didn't even know why,
and you spent eight hours<br/>setting up Christmas lights
in the apartment<br/>just to cheer her up.
That was a platonic friend thing.<br/>A platonic friend thing?
Really? Ted,<br/>let me ask you a question.
Would you have done that for me?
You probably would have.<br/>You're such a good friend, Ted.
You, too, buddy.
I'm going into the city.
Just, while I'm gone,
don't go snooping around<br/>in our stuff.
I know you think we have<br/>a sex tape hidden somewhere,
so I'll save you the trouble.<br/>We don't. Good-bye.
Here's that moment<br/>from Barney's perspective.
We have a sex tape hidden<br/>somewhere.
Challenge accepted.
Robin again?
Why does everyone<br/>keep going after Robin?
How come no one<br/>ever takes a run at me?
Barney hits on you every day.
Yeah, but he just wants<br/>to bang me.
I want something real.
I know, babe.
Double A Cleaning.
Consuela, it's Barney.
I need you and the girls<br/>for the afternoon.
Of course, right away,<br/>Mr. Barney.
Are you at home now?
No, I'm at a house<br/>on Long Island.
I'll text you the details.
It's a big job.<br/>The place has been ransacked.
We'll get right on it.
Thanks, Consuela,<br/>you're the best.
Ted, I know<br/>you're ready to go
with this whole<br/>you-and-Robin thing,
but is she ready<br/>to go?
Is she ready to go? Um...
Mmm, we'll continue this...
when I get back.
So...
Are you sure<br/>that it wasn't...?
We'll continue this<br/>when I get back.
Okay.
What?! No!
Damn it, Lily,<br/>why are you rooting against me?
I'm not rooting<br/>against you.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
Yes, she was.
You see, at that very moment...
"Long-term bets"?
Hmm.
My God! They're placing bets<br/>on our lives.
And I'm sorry,<br/>Ted cannot pull off bald.
You know Ted.<br/>I'm right about this.
Ted, I'm your best friend.<br/>Why would I root against you?
Lily bets Marshall that Ted<br/>and Robin won't end up together.
That's why.
So, Lily was betting against<br/>me and Robin.
I just didn't know it.
Okay, you want to make<br/>it work with Robin?
You need to stay<br/>on her radar.
Call her right now.
She's on the plane.<br/>Her phone's off.
Oh, my God!
How adorable would it be<br/>if when the plane lands,
she turns on her phone
and her mailbox is full<br/>of messages from you?!
Ted, don't leave<br/>her any voice mails.
Why not?
Because...<br/>Because you need to go to Russia.
With love!
Surprise her.
Make the--<br/>in no way creepy--
grand romantic gesture<br/>that we all know Robin loves.
Oh!
So I just walk up to her<br/>in Red Square
with a dozen roses?
Or float down to her
in my hot air balloon
with ten dozen roses!
Yes, that's perfect!
Not like this, Lily.
Not like this.
If you'll excuse me,<br/>I've got some sonnets to write.
Stay put, Ted.<br/>You're gonna want to hear this.
Guys, what's this?
And Marshall and Lily<br/>explained.
It all started ten years<br/>earlier.
They had been looking<br/>for a new hobby
they could do as a couple.
I already missed<br/>the beginner's lesson.
Maybe I shouldn't even go.
Ah, screw it.
I've seen the Olympics.<br/>I know what I'm doing.
I'm going skiing, bitches!
He's gonna break<br/>his leg.
He's not gonna<br/>break his leg.
20 bucks says he does.
"Lily bets Marshall
that Ted<br/>will break his leg skiing."
You would be amazed.
People fall off ski lifts<br/>all the time.
Well, I gotta hit the head.
Well, he didn't<br/>break his leg.
Yeah, I gotta say that, um,
making money off this bet<br/>just makes me feel...
More alive than<br/>you've felt in years?
Yes!<br/>New hobby!
We need a cash box,<br/>some glitter and some glue!
You've been<br/>betting on us?
Like we're a<br/>couple of hobos
fighting over<br/>a sandwich
in some psycho preppy<br/>kid's backyard?
No, this is just<br/>what happens in marriage.
You get bored.
You run out<br/>of things to do.
We were making models.
You single people<br/>are out there
with the drinking<br/>and the sleeping around...
Model airplanes.
The grinding<br/>and the bumping
and the hot sweaty bodies.
...with little propellers<br/>that spin.
Oh, this one looks<br/>interesting.
Lily, I thought you said<br/>you wanted to.
It was your idea.
I starved myself for a week<br/>to get camera-ready.
You had a bear claw<br/>for breakfast.
Yeah, a bear claw.
I-I changed my mind.
I-I just don't want Barney<br/>to see us doing it.
Barney is never gonna see this.
Oh, come on. It's Barney.
Eventually,<br/>somehow he's gonna see it.
Want to bet?
So there really is a sex tape.
Anyhoozles,<br/>just... long-term bets,
just a silly thing we do.
What about you, Ted?
Your hair's looking good.
"Lily bets Marshall<br/>that Ted and Robin
won't end up together."
Wow.
So now it's<br/>becoming clear why...
you've been trying to sabotage<br/>my future happiness.
To win a bet.
Come on, Ted.
We made that bet<br/>so long ago.
And boy, it's been<br/>a real nail-biter.
Ted and Stella<br/>got engaged.
Pay up.
Not yet.
We are driving<br/>to the wedding.
Pay up.
Not yet.
We are at the wedding.
Pay up.
Not yet.
Damn it.
I can't believe you guys!
I got left at the altar,
and all you cared about<br/>was some stupid bet?
I never stopped rooting<br/>for you, but I...
Ted, I'm not rooting<br/>against you.
I just don't think Robin's<br/>the girl you marry.
That's why I made<br/>the stupid bet to begin with.
I mean, yes,<br/>it's five years later,
and you haven't settled down<br/>with anyone else,
but you haven't settled down<br/>with Robin, either.
There must be<br/>a reason for that.
What's standing<br/>in the way?
God...
if you help me find<br/>this sex tape,
I am going to make<br/>some changes in my life.
I am going to stop<br/>sleeping around,
quit drinking so much,<br/>no more shenanigans.
I am going to devote<br/>my entire life
to doing good deeds,<br/>and praising your name.
Is this what you're<br/>looking for, Mr. Barney?
Never mind, bro. Found it.
I found it!
Sweet glory hallelujah,<br/>I found it, Ted.
You're the only idiot I know<br/>who still owns a VCR,
so you are<br/>the lucky winner of the
"Who gets to sit next to me<br/>and watch our best friends
go bananas all over each other""<br/>sweepstakes.
To the outdated<br/>viewing device!
And then I realized<br/>why Robin and I
hadn't gotten back together<br/>in the last five years.
Oh, my God.
Robin's in love with you.
I can't believe<br/>I didn't see it before.
Robin is in love with you.
No, she's not.<br/>Trust me.
Yes, she is.
Something happened<br/>between you guys.
That's why<br/>you broke up with Nora.
That night,<br/>I saw you in her room,
there were rose petals,<br/>candles...
You saw that?
Well, then, maybe you also saw
those rose petals and candles<br/>going into a garbage bag.
And then Barney<br/>told me everything.
How he and Robin hooked up.
How he broke up with Nora<br/>to be with her.
How he thought she would do<br/>the same for him.
How she broke his heart.
She chose Kevin.
It hurt, but...
I guess they're in love.
They broke up last night.
Bummer.
Anyway, let's make our own bets<br/>about this sex tape.
I've got Marshall<br/>with a surprise piercing
at five-to-one odds,
Lily with a landing strip,<br/>ten-to-one,
Marshall with a landing strip,<br/>even money.
I don't believe this.
You were in love with Robin,
you find out she's single,<br/>and your reaction is "Bummer"?
What do you want me to say, Ted?
Whatever I<br/>thought was there,
she thought differently.
So... no, I don't care<br/>that Robin is single again.
So if Robin started dating<br/>someone else, you wouldn't mind?
Nope.
Even if that somebody else<br/>was me?
Even if that somebody else<br/>was you.
Really?<br/>Really.
Hey, bros before hos, right?
No matter how mad she made me,
Robin's still my bro.
And if, uh, you make her happy,
then that makes me happy.
Barney, you've really grown up,<br/>you know that?
Thanks.
Now let's watch our two best<br/>friends have sex on tape.
I'll make the popcorn.
Don't watch that tape!
Watch that tape!
Well, sorry, I just really<br/>want to win the bet.
And here we go.
O-okay. Okay, fine, Barney.
Watch our dirty little home<br/>movie, but be forewarned,
at about the one minute mark,
you're going to see me<br/>make this face.
Oh, God,<br/>that's the face you made
the day we rode motorcycles.<br/>Yeah.
Yeah. You really<br/>want to see that?
A-and do you want<br/>to hear me go, uh...
It can't sound like that.<br/>It can't.
I know that noise, I've heard it<br/>through the walls.
I thought the neighbors<br/>had a sick cat.
Okay, but, Barney,<br/>just remember,
you'll also be seeing<br/>a lot of this:
Oh, yeah.<br/>Oh, yeah.
It's this, but<br/>I'm not pregnant.
My skin is loose,<br/>like an elephant.
My boobs are<br/>perky and plump.
I slobber<br/>like a confused old dog.
I slap my own ass.<br/>I slap my own ass!
Barney...
that was my VCR.
Ted...
it was a VCR.
A week later, Robin's plane landed...
and I was there to meet<br/>her at the airport.
♪
She told me all about her trip.
And then we got dinner at the restaurant<br/> we hadn't been to in a long time.
And by the end of the night,<br/>one thing had become clear:
It's not going to happen, is it?
I'm sorry.
It's because of Barney.
What?
No.
Barney and I... we...
No. No. It's just...
You know, things have<br/>just been so crazy lately.
Everything in my life<br/>is... unstable.
I mean, you're one of the few<br/>things that I can count on.
And... I really don't<br/>want to mess that up.
We-we... we still have our deal,<br/>right?
If we're both still...<br/>single when we're 40?
Yeah. Yeah.
No. Look... I'm sorry.
I-I can't do that anymore.
As long as the door<br/>is even a little bit open,
I have this feeling<br/>that I'll just be...
waiting around to see if I win<br/>the lottery when you turn 40.
I think you know<br/>how you feel about me now,
and... I don't think time's<br/>going to change that.
Just tell me.
Do you love me?
No.
I'm sorry.
We're great as friends.
Let's just...
Let's just forget<br/>I ever said anything.
Bar. Alone. Now.
It's just a bump<br/>in the road.
You guys are meant<br/>to be together.
You can't give up.
You... i-it can still happen.
No. Marshall...
What about<br/>the hot air balloon thing,
with the ten dozen roses?
And how's the sonnet coming, buddy?<br/>Dude.
You bet on the wrong horse.<br/>Let it go.
Believe it or not,
I'm happy about this. I'm...
I can finally move on.
This is a good thing.
Really.
Hey, Robin.
Oh, hey.<br/>Hey.
Hey. Uh, look, before I forget,<br/>here's Lily's hairdryer.
I borrowed it, like,<br/>a million years ago.
Yeah, you can keep that.
Um... Hey, listen,
Ted told me what happened<br/>with you guys,
and he says that<br/>he's at peace with it.
Oh, really?
That's good.
He's lying, Robin.
He's trying to be strong,<br/>but it's killing him,
and so, as his best friend,
I have to say something that...
he loves you<br/>just way too much to say.
You gotta move out.
I know.
♪ And all of the ghouls<br/>come out to play ♪
♪ And every demon<br/>wants his pound of flesh ♪
♪ But I like to keep<br/>some things to myself ♪
♪ I like to keep<br/>my issues strong ♪
♪ It's always darkest<br/>before the dawn ♪
♪ And I've been a fool<br/>and I've been blind ♪
♪ I can never leave<br/>the past behind ♪
♪ I can see no way
♪ I can see<br/>no way ♪
♪ I'm always dragging<br/>that horse around ♪
Here's the funny thing.
In my own crazy way,<br/>I was kind of happy.
For the first time in years,<br/>there was no little part of me
clinging to the dream<br/>of being with Robin.
Which meant,<br/>for the first time in years,
the world was wide open.
Because, kids...
when a door closes,
well...
...you know the rest.
♪ Shake it out, shake it out
♪ Oh, whoa...
♪ And it's hard to dance
♪ With a devil on your back
♪ So shake him off
- For Ted's sake,<br/>- I hate to say this,
but... pay up.
Not yet.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">NARRATOR: Kids, 2012 started out<br/>kind of crazy.
Barney met a girl named Quinn,
Kevin unproposed to Robin,
I told Robin...
I love you, Robin.
When I asked if she
loved me back, she said...
No.
Marshall told Robin...
You got to move out.
And Robin did.
I can't even open<br/>her bedroom door anymore.
Why do I have<br/>to be so sensitive?
I don't know, bro.
Look at me and that Quinn chick.
You don't hear me<br/>prattling on
about how beautiful<br/>her smile is,
how her hair is like a waterfall<br/>of honey-colored silk,
how her eyes are like<br/>a warm South Sea
kissed by the fire<br/>and gold of sunrise.
I don't even remember<br/>what she looks like.
Dude, you obviously like her.<br/>Can't you read
between the lines, Ted?
I obviously like her.
How did this happen to me?
When did I become such<br/>a gooey romantic?
Look, I think it's healthy
that you have real feelings<br/>for a woman
instead of just seeing her<br/>as an object.
Switch?
Sure.
(snaps fingers)
But why Quinn?
I mean, you spent<br/>one night with her,
and she was kind of mean.
We just connected.
Emotionally, intellectually,<br/>spiritually.
So, mind-blowing sex?
Mind-blowing sex!
For an hour afterwards,<br/>I couldn't uncross my eyes.
Which was awesome, because<br/>when I went back for seconds,
it was like having<br/>a three-way with twins.
So... call her.
I would if I knew how<br/>to get in touch with her,
but I can't,<br/>and it's driving me crazy.
Everywhere I look,<br/>I see her.
I see her walking on the street;
I see her shopping in the store;
I see her dancing on that pole.
I see her dancing<br/>on that pole, too.
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.
EMCEE: Gentlemen,<br/>give it up for Karma.
I really appreciate<br/>you guys taking me in.
I mean,
I'm homeless,
things between me and Ted<br/>are still kind of weird.
So, it's nice<br/>to be around friends.
Well, stay as long<br/>as you want, sweetie.
Oh, thank you.
Mm.
Now, I got you a journal.
I know this sounds lame,
but it really helps work<br/>through stuff to write about it.
Oh.
"Dear Diary. The fantasies<br/>of killing Marshall's mom
"have become more vivid.
Today, I scalped her with a ..""<br/>Whoops,
that one's mine.
You are going to have<br/>so much fun here.
Oh, guys, please, do not feel like you<br/>have to keep me entertained.
Well, you shouldn't have come<br/>to East Meadow, Long Island,
Robin, if you didn't want<br/>to be entertained.
Really? I didn't think<br/>there was a ton to do here.
Oh, apparently, someone<br/>hasn't heard
of the Uniondale<br/>Miniatures Museum.
You'll come for<br/>the 19th century thimble art,
but you'll stay for the<br/>Dutch masters on bottle caps.
Plus,
you'll be bowling<br/>with two
charter members of the<br/>East Meadow Alley Cats.
"We're a hot dog eating team
with a bowling problem."
Shirley
came up with that one.
Great bowler, Shirley.
She hit 280 the other day.
Unfortunately,<br/>that was on her bathroom scale.
NARRATOR: When Robin moved out,
there was a hole in my life
in the shape<br/>of an empty bedroom.
I filled it with a new hobby.
(sizzling)
(coughing)
What are you doing<br/>in my old room?
This room being empty<br/>was bumming me out,
so I decided<br/>to do something healthy
that would take my mind off you.
Well, nothing says healthy
like smoking 40 pounds<br/>of pork loin
in an unventilated room
while having an imaginary<br/>conversation with your ex.
Just for that,<br/>you're not getting any.
I'm not getting any?
You're the one smoking<br/>your own meat.
Oh!
(knocking)
What am I gonna do<br/>about this Quinn thing?
I want to ask her out again,
but I don't know how I feel<br/>about her being a stripper.
Why would you have<br/>an issue with that?
I mean, you've dated convicted<br/>felons, arms dealers...
pageant moms.
Hey, Quinn is someone I might<br/>want to get serious with,
not just pretend to be a judge
(chuckles) Tiffany's mom really<br/>wanted that tiara.
In a city of eight<br/>million people,
you happened to walk into<br/>the club where she works?
Maybe it's destiny.
No, Destiny strips<br/>at The Melon Patch.
They're people, Ted;<br/>try to keep them straight.
Wait a minute.
What if this is destiny?
I just said...
What if the universe
is throwing us in each other's<br/>path for some reason?
More or less exactly what I...
I don't care what you say,<br/>this is destiny!
Damn it, Ted!
Why can't you ever root<br/>for love?
Hey.
Hey.
Quinn...
No, listen,
in here I'm Karma, okay?
Got it.
Uh, look, Karma,
I swear
I never say crap<br/>like this, but...
I think maybe<br/>the universe
is telling us something.
You want to go out again?
I'm sorry,<br/>I don't date customers.
What about destiny?
I heard she's<br/>over at The Melon Patch now.
No, I mean like fate telling us<br/>that we're supposed to be...
Oh, listen, Barney,
my manager is really<br/>giving me the stink eye.
I have to get back to work.
Okay, wait, wait.
What if I pay for a dance?
That way,
your manager's happy,
and then I can to tell you
why you should go on<br/>another date with me.
I guess there's<br/>no reason why not.
Okay, first off,<br/>we have a lot in common.
For example,
both of our jobs<br/>are largely financed
by drunk Asian businessmen.
Dear Diary.
It is day four on this island,
which the natives have dubbed<br/>"Long Island,"
perhaps referencing
how each hour here feels<br/>like it may never end.
So far, they have welcomed me
and given me a rare glimpse<br/>into their bizarre way of life.
By "entertainment," they mean<br/>table shuffle board,
macramé classes, and other<br/>non-stimulating activities
which are only used<br/>in Manhattan
to calm down drug addicts<br/>and the criminally insane.
A preliterate society,<br/>their menus display pictures
of the food they offer,
everyone is forced<br/>to sing "Happy Birthday"
four or five times a meal,
and dessert<br/>has fireworks in it.
In their lairs, they often don<br/>a primitive shroud
called a "Snugget,"<br/>and it is not uncommon for them
to go to sleep before 9 p.m.,
fearing, as they do,
the night.
Also Diary, I think writing<br/>in you is stupid,
but you were a gift from Lily,
and she's watching<br/>me right now.
Guys, um, I don't want<br/>to overstay my welcome,
and Patrice said that she would<br/>take me off your hands.
So, do you have<br/>a train schedule or...
Oh, yeah,
um, but-but
there's a-a problem<br/>with the train.
Big, big problem.
There was a...
Strike.<br/>A lightning strike.
That hit one of the picketers<br/>who was on strike.
During a thunderstorm.
Plus,
Yeah, she probably doesn't<br/>even want you there.
You guys are being weird.
Oh!<br/>Oh!
Oh, my God, Robin,<br/>I am so sorry.
I'll throw these in the wash.
They'll be dry<br/>and folded in the morning.
Or the weekend.
And we can talk<br/>about you leaving then.
(quietly):<br/>Or never.
Wait, Lily, why don't...<br/>(yawns loudly)
It's 8:45,<br/>time to hit the hay.
LILY:<br/>Good night!
(lock clicks)
So Ted, what healthy,
not-at-all-crazy activity<br/>are you up to now?
I liked smoking meat,<br/>but now I've got a new passion:
wood.
You hear these things that come<br/>out of your mouth, right?
(knocking)
So I went back to<br/>the Lusty Leopard.
You know what, Barney?
I know I said I have a rule<br/>about not dating customers,
but you may have<br/>convinced me to...
(music stops)<br/>Oh.
Song's over, I got to go.
Wait, no, what?<br/>Convinced you to what?
I'm sorry, but manager's<br/>giving me the stink eye.
Ugh, get a life, Manager.
What were you saying?
Well, I was going to say
that I do find you<br/>very... charming.
(chuckles)
And funny...
and sexy.
And exciting and smart.
You so get me.
You know what, Barney?
I have never done<br/>this before,
but there's just<br/>something about you.
So I guess my answer is...
(music stops)<br/>(gasps) Oh.
The song's over.
Well, just finish the thought!
But the manager.<br/>God,
I hate manager.
(snoring)
There. Your answer is...
Maybe if we knew each other<br/>a little better.
(sighs)
Tell me about yourself.
Well, um, what can I tell you?
I'm, um...
charming and funny
and sexy and...
exciting and smart.
Well, how can a girl<br/>say no to that?
How about we...
go out on...
aaaaaaaaa...
aaaaaa...
Ugh, these songs are so short.
(groans)
Uh, how much exactly<br/>did you give Quinn?
Eight, nine hundred bucks,
plus whatever<br/>my Rolex is worth.
Whoa.
I know.
Ted, I think I'm in love.
Quinn is totally playing you.
What?
That's ridiculous.
If she were playing me,
why would she agree<br/>to go on a date with me?
You're different than<br/>the rest of these schlubs.
This one time only,<br/>I'm going to break my rule.
Let's go out tomorrow night.
Sweet!
Oh, shoot!<br/>I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!
Hey! Brainstorm!
What if we just have<br/>our date here,
It's a date.
It's not a date, if you go into a<br/>strip club and paying for lap dances.
If it's not a date, why'd she<br/>say, every fifth day was free?
Because that's<br/>the Lusty Leopard's policy
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad<br/>at you that I know that!
ROBIN: Dear Diary.
It is day six on this island,
and I begin to fear I am<br/>more captive than guest...
(screams)
Morning, sweetie.
Up for croquet?
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done
washing my clothes yet?<br/>Because I...
Oh, I am so sorry.
Your clothes accidentally<br/>wound up in the bag
I donated to Goodwill.
You gave away my clothes?
They were a bit fancy<br/>for East Meadow.
(whispers):<br/>People were staring.
Besides, we have<br/>an extra Snugget.
Try it.
Try it, Robin.
ROBIN: They're trying to make me<br/>one of them, Diary.
And I begin to fear...
I may like it!
I can't believe we're<br/>at a strip club,
and the biggest boob<br/>in here is you.
It's a real date, Ted.
And clearly you haven't<br/>seen the DeSalvo twins.
She's right over there.
Barney...<br/>Yowza!
You are not on a date.
Okay, look, prove it.
Prove that she's not just<br/>taking advantage of you.
Get her to go out with<br/>you anywhere but here.
Fine!
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?
Yeah!
Uh, one thing, though.
Um, you'd be okay<br/>with us having a date
somewhere besides here,<br/>wouldn't you?
I was hoping you would ask that.
I'm sorry it's<br/>so expensive in here,
but it's nice and private, huh?
Absolutely. And romantic!
It's our first getaway<br/>as a couple!
It's become clear to me, Diary,
that I must attempt<br/>a dramatic escape.
I will fake a stomach ache<br/>during dinner.
Then, after Marshall and Lily<br/>leave for bingo night,
I will sneak out the back.
I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal<br/>and drive to the train station.
Shirley's 42, by the way,<br/>and rides a Rascal.
I swear, it's the second half<br/>of Wall-E out here.
(two handclaps)
Bingo...
was canceled.
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?
(chuckles) No,<br/>I'm not a customer.
My girlfriend works here.
She's right over...
This one time only,<br/>I'm gonna break my rule.
Let's go out tomorrow night!
Sweet!
Oh, shoot!
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!
Hey! Brainstorm!
What if we just have<br/>our date here,
maybe in<br/>the Champagne Room?
That was our spot.
Hey, gorgeous,<br/>You want a dance?
Is it a jig?
'Cause if so, it's up.
Sorry, I only had the last verse
of "Hot For Teacher" to work<br/>on that. What was that?
You laid exactly the same line<br/>on that guy that you did on me!
Sweetie, that is just something
I say to these<br/>gullible losers here.
They fall for it every time.
(chuckling): Bunch of losers!
Oh, gosh, manager again.
He's looking at me like,
"Karma, why aren't you booking<br/>more time
in the Champagne Room?"
Well, we'll show him.
No! You're playing me again!
And you're not even trying hard!
There's no manager there;<br/>You're pointing at a fern!
Ted was right.
I bet he's home right now,<br/>laughing at how dumb I am.
Did I deserve this?<br/>Absolutely.
I have told<br/>some outrageous lies.
I have told women I was famous,
a war hero,
that sex with me would cure<br/>their nearsightedness.
Barney?!
I probably deserved everything<br/>you did to me and more.
But I have been trying,
and trying hard<br/>to be a better person.
Thanks for showing me
I had it right before.
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel<br/>a little suffocated,
but were you really<br/>just gonna sneak away?
Well, it's just...<br/>I really miss the city.
I know you guys love it here,<br/>and that's fine,
We don't love it here!
What?
Come on, Robin,
what kind<br/>of life is this?
Going to canasta tournaments
and high school<br/>field hockey playoffs?
Oh, I think North Bellmore<br/>can take state.
With Sophie's ankle?<br/>Doubtful.
Okay, but if you two<br/>are so unhappy,
why don't you just move<br/>back to Manhattan?
Because the suburbs are<br/>better for the baby.
Who says? Who says any place<br/>is better for the baby
if you two are unhappy in it?
No, no,<br/>we live here now.
And, you know,<br/>this place
wouldn't seem<br/>so bad if...
we got one of our friends<br/>to move out here.
Oh, guys...
Oh...
I would rather set myself<br/>on fire.
NARRATOR: The next morning,<br/>Barney learned that even in
a city of eight million people,<br/>there's no escaping Karma.
(light music playing)
(sighs)
Oh.
Oh, hey.
Sorry, can't talk;<br/>manager's watching.
Look, I am sorry
if I hurt your feelings;<br/>it's a job.
Yeah, well, at my job,
we don't rip out<br/>people's hearts for money.
My company briefly backed<br/>a lab in North Korea
which did, but we sold it!
You know, I've worked<br/>at that club for a year.
You practically live there,
and you didn't even recognize me<br/>the night we went out.
You can't pretend to be some<br/>hurt little victim with me.
I know you.
Well, of course you do.
I told you things<br/>I don't tell anybody.
I was honest with you.
Yeah, because I believe you have<br/>a gay black brother,
a friend lonely enough<br/>to smoke his own meat
and that your mom was a groupie<br/>for Supertramp.
They named<br/>their band for her!
You remembered all that?
Well, yeah.<br/>I mean,
you're more interesting<br/>than the lyrics
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me"<br/>for the 8,000th time.
You know, it's funny.
Almost every woman<br/>I've ever met was wrong
to give me a chance.
You're the first woman<br/>who's wrong not to.
Large black coffee...
and whatever he's having.
It's on me.
The same.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
1,700 more of these<br/>and we're even.
Uh, the song just ended.
That mean you got<br/>to get going?
No.
Do you have time<br/>to sit with me?
I don't know.<br/>You're wearing my watch.
Pottery.<br/>Now you're making pottery.
I needed a new vase...
and some plates.
And bowls.
The china cabinet I built had<br/>some design flaws.
Why don't you just turn<br/>this into a guest room?
A guest room?
(chuckles) You mean<br/>a room ready and waiting
for someone who isn't there?
A room devoted to reminding me<br/>that I'm still alone?
Yeah, I don't need that.
Ted, no matter how many things<br/>you put in this room...
I'll still be here.
(knocking)
Hey.
Hey!
Come on in.
Thanks.
Oh, um, thanks for packing up<br/>the rest of my stuff.
No problem. Uh, you<br/>want some coffee?
Uh, sure. Yeah?<br/>Yeah.
So, how are things?
Good! You?<br/>Great!
You know, I actually<br/>made this mug.
Oh, yeah? Oh!<br/>Yeah. Oh!
Yeah, sorry, coffee's<br/>a little strong.
How was your stay<br/>with Marshall and Lily?
Uh... a little weird.
They're not loving Long Island.
Oh.
I think deep down, they realize
it just... isn't a good fit.
It's hard to admit that<br/>sometimes.
Sure is.
But I guess it's better<br/>to face it and move on
than try to force something that<br/>just isn't meant to be, right?
I think so.
Yeah.
So, what do you think
you're gonna do<br/>with my old room?
Haven't really thought about it.
Oh!
Who needs Manhattan?
Yeah.
(phone buzzes)
Hmm, it's Ted.<br/>He wants to know
if we want to hang<br/>out in the city.
The next train leaves<br/>in nine minutes.
(door closes)
TED: Dear Lily and Marshall,<br/>I don't know if you know this,
but I never took<br/>your names off the lease.
Well, today<br/>I took my name off it.
The apartment is now yours.
And I think I finally figured<br/>out the best thing
to do with Robin's old room.
(soft gasp)
See, for me, this place has<br/>begun to feel a little haunted.
At first, I thought<br/>it was haunted by Robin,
but now I think<br/>it was haunted by me.
Well, no ghost is at peace<br/>until it finally moves on.
I need a change.
And I think you do, too.
This apartment needs<br/>some new life.
So, please, make our old home<br/>your new home.
It is now ghost-free.
Love, Ted.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the spring of 2012,
your Uncle Barney went off<br/>the grid for a couple weeks.
So I was relieved<br/>when I got a text
asking me to come over<br/>to his place.
Glad to hear from you, buddy.
I was worried something<br/>bad happened...
to you.
Welcome, brother.
What is this?
Ted Evelyn Mosby,
you are about to be<br/>sworn to secrecy
through the sacred vows<br/>of a Bro Oath,
or "Broath."
Please, put on<br/>your "brobe."
Yeah, I'm not putting on<br/>the "brobe."
Ted, just...
just... Okay?
♪ Broooo... ♪
Wait, are they chanting "bro"?
♪ Bro... ♪
I got some local monks<br/>to record this.
Yeah! I got a monk guy.
Cool, right?
It actually is, yeah.
I'll burn it for you.
Just remind me after The Broath.
Anyway, Ted Evelyn Mosby,
this ritual forever binds you<br/>to keep a solemn secret...
Which is?
I really like this Quinn girl!
We've been spending<br/>tons of time together,
and I want the gang to meet her.
But I'm afraid they're<br/>gonna disapprove because,
- well, you know.<br/>- I did know. You see,
Quinn was a stripper...
who had swindled Barney out of<br/>quite a bit of cash.
We're inviting everyone<br/>to dinner at Quinn's,
and I want them to<br/>keep an open mind,
which brings us to The Broath.
Place your hand<br/>on The Bro Code.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Repeat after me.
I, Ted Evelyn Mosby...
"I, Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You<br/>My Middle Name" Mosby..."
solemnly swear not to<br/>tell our friends
that Quinn is a stripper.
"...solemnly swear not<br/>to tell our friends
that Quinn is a stripper" who<br/>duped you out of lots of money.
You're only supposed<br/>to repeat after me.
"You're only supposed<br/>to repeat after me."
- Stop it.<br/>- Stop it.
Silence!
Look, I know that things<br/>started out sketchy
with me and Quinn, but<br/>I really like her, so please.
Do you,
Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,
swear to uphold this Broath?
I do.
Barney's dating a stripper<br/>who's gonna steal all his money!
Okay, time to go to<br/>Quinn's. Now remember,
I told you nothing, okay?
Barney really wants<br/>us all to like her.
But how can we?
Quinn totally duped Barney,<br/>and he couldn't even see it.
Well, apparently, the sex<br/>is mind-blowing.
Ha, I've been there.<br/>Yeah.
I was once with this chick
who answered the door wearing<br/>nothing but, uh, whipped cream,
a dog collar<br/>and a hot pink thong.
Marshall,
you can't tell sex stories
about "this chick," because
everyone knows it's me.
I'm the only woman<br/>you've ever been with.
It's not fair, the guys are<br/>always telling their sex stories
and I can top<br/>every one of them.
Baby, you're like 20 slutty<br/>chicks all rolled into one.
Sweet talk is not going<br/>to change my mind.
Let's focus.
Tonight, we want to make sure
that Quinn is not<br/>out to scam Barney.
So, when we walk back<br/>through that door
three hours from now,<br/>we should all be able
to answer one simple question:
Do we trust this girl?
Well, for one thing,
she seems kind of controlling.
Is it okay if I put out<br/>the hummus, bunny face?
No, save it for dessert.
Idiot.
Uh, ah...
More red wine, beauty-swan?
She drinks a lot.
Is it okay if I<br/>go pee, sugar lamb?
No!
You just went three hours ago.
You're right, baby bear!
Yes, so Barney's whipped;<br/>It doesn't mean
that Quinn is a con artist.
Well, maybe we could've gotten<br/>a better read on her
if two people<br/>hadn't gone off topic.
By the way, Quinn,<br/>your apartment is amazing.
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
I'm actually moving out soon.
If you know anyone<br/>looking for a sublet,
this place is rent-controlled.
You would not believe<br/>what I pay.
Kids, things have been tense
between Robin and I for weeks.
Ever since she moved out,
and I gave the apartment<br/>to Marshall and Lily,
I'd been crashing<br/>in university housing.
It's 10:00,<br/>damn it.
Ned, Martin and Millie,
people are trying to sleep!
Hey, you were young<br/>like us once, right?
I was never like you guys.
And Robin was staying<br/>with her coworker, Patrice.
You seem so down today, Robin.
I made you cookies.
Damn it, Patrice,<br/>stop smothering me!
So, when Quinn said<br/>her apartment was available...
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!
Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!
We got off topic?<br/>What about Marshall?
Hey, I was just<br/>going along with
whoever suggested<br/>we play that game.
Hey, let's play a game!
Uh, craziest<br/>sex-in-public story; I'll start.
I was once with this chick
who loved to get freaky<br/>in elevators.
Doors would close;<br/>Suddenly,
she's panting on all fours<br/>like a dog in heat.
Marshall, stop.
I never said that it was you.
Okay, so anyway, last August,
I go bareback<br/>with this same slut.
She get's pregnant;<br/>Bitch is even hornier.
Oh, yeah? I was once<br/>with this dude
who I caught eating<br/>a sandwich during sex.
Big ol' meatball
falls out, lands on my back,
rolls on to the elevator floor.
Hmm. Disgusting, right?
What, I never said it was you.
Yeah, sorry we didn't stay<br/>as laser-focused as you guys.
Hey, at least I got<br/>some evidence.
Look what I found<br/>in Quinn's bedroom.
Barney's taking her to Hawaii.
Lily, you snooped<br/>through her stuff?
No. It's like<br/>the first thing you see
when you jimmy open her desk<br/>drawer with a letter opener
her grandfather left her,<br/>according to her diary.
First-class tickets,
a four-star hotel--<br/>this cost Barney a fortune.
Yeah, this proves that Quinn is<br/>totally using him for his money.
You know what Lily, enough.
Guys, even if you're right<br/>about Quinn, this is Barney.
He'll come to his senses.
I give this whole thing<br/>a week, two weeks, tops.
And now, we have<br/>an announcement.
Can I tell them?
No.
We're moving in together<br/>We're m...
Congrats! That's great.<br/>So happy for you.
We gotta end this.
Yup.
Kids, as you'll recall,
our gang had a subtle way<br/>of letting someone know
they were making a mistake.
Where have you been?
Oh, worth it. Hang on.
Hey.
You know we would've<br/>hated ourselves, right?
So,
did Robin tell you the incredibly<br/>devious thing she did today?
Me?!
Hey, so I just happened<br/>to be in the neighborhood
and I thought, "Man, Quinn<br/>is in such great shape,
she must love fruit."
So, unrelated,
how's the search for<br/>a sub-letter going?
This is such a<br/>weird coincidence!
Robin also "just happened"<br/>to be in the neighborhood
with a bottle of wine<br/>and her credit scores.
I can't believe you two.
What do you care about more,<br/>protecting your friend
from getting hurt or scoring<br/>this girl's apartment?
There's a working fireplace!
Patrice is ironing<br/>my pants all wrong!
You guys should be ashamed.
Speaking of shame,
I was once with this chick<br/>who liked to do hand stuff
underneath a jacket<br/>while we were all
sitting around our<br/>favorite booth at MacLaren's.
Gross.
We share appetizers.
Okay, well, I was once<br/>with a dude
who couldn't even fantasize<br/>about a three-way.
He was all,<br/>"Ew, she's your best friend."
What now?
I was once with a<br/>chick who wanted
to get it on during a school<br/>production of Peter Pan.
Well, I...<br/>Wait, that wasn't me.
So, back to Patrice<br/>and this ironing issue...
I thought I was the first girl<br/>you ever did anything with.
Anything serious.
Please don't tell me that<br/>you're jealous of me getting
to second base in tenth grade<br/>with Jenna Cristalli.
Don't say that whore's name<br/>in front of our baby.
What's going on?
Barney, this in an intervention.
A "Quinntervention."
You and Quinn are moving really<br/>fast, and we don't trust her.
We're just looking out<br/>for your best interests.
"Quinn-terests."
I don't understand. Wh...
Wait a sec.
Ted Evelyn Mosby...
you broke The Broath.
How dare you?!
A Broath is the most sacred bond<br/>between-- okay, yeah, I did.
Are you aware that<br/>breaking a Broath
can have deadly,<br/>even fatal repercussions?
Have you studied history, Ted?
Extensively.<br/>But I'm a little shaky
on fake history, so...
The tragic cost of<br/>a broken Broath
Uh-huh.
Dates back to<br/>Ancient Bro-man times...
Hey, Bro-tus,
you'd tell me if,<br/>like, a bunch of dudes
were conspiring to<br/>assassinate me, right?
Um, totally, Caesar.
Paranoid much?
Just to be sure,
can you swear a Broath to me?
Sure. I swear.
Thanks.
You've always got my back.
Et tu, Bro-te?
And then he banged,<br/>like, a hundred chicks
and invented a salad.
True story.
Well, Quinn lied to you;<br/>She manipulated you.
What if she's just using you?
She's not just using me.
What about the expensive<br/>trip to Hawaii?
What expensive trip to Hawaii?
The one I got for you.
That was supposed to be<br/>a surprise for Barney.
He asked me to meet him here.
What's going on, you guys?
Tell her.
Fine, I'll fill her in.
And I am so angry,
I'm not even gonna make a joke<br/>about "filling her in."
Which I did three times<br/>last night, self-five.
My friends think<br/>you're wrong for me,
so they're having<br/>an intervention.
A "Quinntervention."
I don't understand.
Well, see, your name<br/>is Quinn, and so...
I'll explain.
I made Ted promise not to tell<br/>them what you do, but he did,
and now they don't trust you.
Wow, that really hurts.
But what's even worse
is that you felt<br/>the need to lie about me.
I'm not ashamed of<br/>who I am, Barney,
but you clearly are.
I'm not ashamed of you.
I just didn't want them<br/>to judge you without...
Maybe we are moving too fast.
What? What is that<br/>supposed to mean?
I don't think I can do this.
Wait, are you ending things<br/>just like that?
If you walk out that door,<br/>you prove them right.
You prove that you're just<br/>some heartless stripper
who never gave a damn about me<br/>in the...
Don't call me.
Wow. That<br/>was intense.
We just destroyed<br/>what could have been
a once-in-a-lifetime shot<br/>at happiness.
I know. I feel guilty, too.
Fireplace, balcony,
hardwood floors...
Okay, I'll just say it:
After everything that<br/>happened between us,
I can't believe you wouldn't
back down and let me<br/>have Quinn's place.
Ted, can I talk to you<br/>out in the hall?
Has it ever occurred to you
that the last few weeks haven't<br/>been easy for me either?
In the span of one day,<br/>my engagement fell apart,
I lost my best friend,<br/>then I lost my apartment.
And-and now I'm about<br/>to lose my job.
What do you mean?
I-I've been completely<br/>distracted at work.
And now my boss wants to see me<br/>Friday at 5:00,
which, around the office,<br/>is known as "fire o'clock."
I had no idea.
How could you?
The one person I want to talk<br/>to most barely looks me
in the eye anymore,<br/>much less returns my calls.
Ted, I know it took guts<br/>to tell me you love me.
And I-I know how much it hurt<br/>that I didn't say it back,
but...
Damn it, th-this sucks<br/>for me, too.
And I-I miss you.
Is there any way we can just...<br/>go back to normal?
I don't think<br/>I can do normal anymore.
Barney still isn't answering.
We gotta go find him<br/>and apologize.
Oh. I thought you were Quinn.
Barney, we're so sorry.
We never should've<br/>meddled like that.
Can you forgive us?<br/>I don't know.
You had no right to do that.
How can we make it<br/>up to you, buddy?
I, one of Barney's<br/>best friends...
"I, one of Barney's<br/>best friends..."
promise never to interfere<br/>with his personal life again...
"...promise never to interfere<br/>with his personal life again..."
unless it's an issue of<br/>health, national security,
or he's about to get up<br/>on a fattie.
"...unless it's an issue of<br/>health, national security,
or he's about to<br/>get up on a fattie."
And now, to seal<br/>this sacred vow,
the two ladies will kiss.<br/>Barney...
The two ladies will kiss!
Mmm.
Lil...
Okay.
And now the gentlemen.
Dude...
And now the gentlemen!
Let's just...<br/>This is silly.
Don't-don't touch<br/>my face.
I was going to say,
"And now the gentlemen<br/>bump fists."
How long you been holding<br/>back that one?
Hot stuff, fellas.
Did I see a little tongue<br/>in there?
I don't understand.
Well, if these two
will keep their sweaty paws<br/>off each other
for half a second, I'll explain.
It all started<br/>a couple days ago...
I want you to meet my friends.
Should I be nervous?
Is it like bringing me home<br/>to meet your parents?
No, no, no.
Much more stressful than that.
You see, my friends, while<br/>awesome, can be presumptuous,
meddlesome and<br/>downright destructive.
When they learn what<br/>you do and how we met,
they'll probably try<br/>to break us up.
So let's have<br/>some fun with them.
Mess with their heads.
Are you saying...<br/>evil plan?
Hells to the yes.
My God, you're hot.
Wait for it.
Here's what we do.
I'll make Ted swear not to tell<br/>anyone what he knows about you,
and he'll cave immediately.
Barney's dating a stripper<br/>who's gonna steal all his money!
Next, we invite everyone over.
Is it okay if I put out<br/>the hummus, bunny face?
- And I'll be the bossy-
No, save it for dessert, idiot.
Nice.
And, finally, we'll announce...
We're moving in together!
I've got an idea.
Let's get your friends<br/>Ted and Robin
fighting over my apartment.
Wait, what does that have<br/>to do with you and me?
Nothing. I just<br/>worship chaos.
I can't handle how hot<br/>you are right now.
Wait for it.<br/>Next,
they'll try to talk me<br/>into dumping you.
And I'll walk in on it.
Then we pretend to break up.
And when they crawl back,
begging for forgiveness...
I'll be the bigger man<br/>and let them off the hook.
Or make the monkeys<br/>dance for you.
God, you're smart!
It's gonna be legen...
I'm not waiting for<br/>it anymore. Mmm...
dary.
My God, you two are...
Perfect together.
So you're not really moving in?
Well, it started out as a joke,
but the more we<br/>talked about it...
The more excited we got.
So, yeah, we are.
You have anything<br/>to say about that?
So happy for you.<br/>Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You two realize this means
my apartment really is<br/>up for grabs, right?
I'm sure I'll find<br/>something else.
- Me, too.<br/>- Yeah.
And that's the story<br/>of how we met Quinn.
That Friday, I met Robin to see<br/>how it went at "fire o'clock."
They promoted me<br/>to on-air talent.
I'm gonna be<br/>Sandy Rivers' new co-host.
Oh, my God!
How'd that happen?
Remember New Year's Eve?
When I filled in for Sandy,<br/>it turns out
the C.E.O.<br/>of World Wide News liked me.
He said I have "moxie."
So he's a 1940s gangster?
Apparently.
And I got a big raise,
so I'm taking this apartment<br/>on Central Park West,
which means...
Quinn's apartment.
I already told her<br/>you'd take it.
Wow. Thanks.
Yeah.
Hey, and congrats.
You deserve it all.
You know, I've been<br/>thinking about it, and...
I can do normal.
To back to normal.
To back to normal.
Uh... I-I should get going.<br/>Yeah.
You've got a lot to do.<br/>Totally.
So...<br/>Um, see you soon.
See you soon.
Yeah.
We wouldn't see each other<br/>for a long time.
But I'll get to that.
Listen, um...
about me getting to second base<br/>in tenth grade
with Jenna Cristalli...
I don't know what you're<br/>talking about.
I've already forgotten<br/>about that dumb hobag.
Yeah, um, it didn't happen while<br/>we were watching Peter Pan.
It happened while I was<br/>playing Peter Pan.
Here's a photo<br/>from the day I was cast.
That's me in the middle.
But then I had my growth spurt.
By opening night, I was too big<br/>for the flying harness,
and, well...
I fell hands-first<br/>right onto Jenna Cristalli.
The tissues in her bra saved me<br/>two broken wrists.
I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted
to have one cool<br/>sex story that wasn't you.
Okay. Next time you tell it,<br/>you were in your dad's car,
which you stole to go<br/>to a Metallica concert,
and you got to third base<br/>with that slut.
I was once with this chick...
who is just the best wife ever.
Thank you for being so cool<br/>about what I do.
A lot of guys would be<br/>weird or jealous.
Are you kidding?
Who am I to judge<br/>anyone? I'm the devil!
I mean, if you ever
wanted to stop stripping,<br/>I'd support it.
- If you wanted... to.<br/>- Uh-huh.
So, you are jealous?
What? No, no, not at all.
I'm just saying,<br/>if you ever wanted to hang up
the ol' G-string,<br/>I'd completely understand.
Nah, I like taking my clothes<br/>off for money.
Great.
Let me... let me finish.
Hypothetically,<br/>what would make you stop?
Hypothetically...
I would stop stripping<br/>if I ever got married.
Good night.
And then we agreed<br/>to "go back to normal."
But I'm starting to wonder if we<br/>can ever really just be friends.
Anyway, that's the story of me<br/>and Robin, 2005 to the present.
What do you think?
I think your stories<br/>are way too long.
I feel bad<br/>for his future kids, dude.
Hey, my kids are gonna<br/>love my stories.
They're gonna... yeah, they're<br/>gonna love my stories.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Chester,<br/>you're not even dressed.
- The reservation is in 15 minutes.<br/>- Shh!
He's back.
Every night<br/>at exactly 8:00 p.m.,
the well-dressed<br/>blond man appears.
Chuck and Joanne
are going to be waiting.<br/>You don't understand!
Every night, he does this.
Every single night.
He steps out of this building,
walks exactly seven paces,<br/>stops,
and smiles.
Honey, I am worried about you.
Is he trying to communicate<br/>with someone?
Is he trying<br/>to communicate with me?
Why is he doing this?!
But aside from not being able
to fart in the apartment,<br/>how's living with Quinn?
Oh, it's great.
Yep.
Living with Quinn is great.
Great, great,<br/>great... great.
So how bad is it?
Pretty bad.
Last night,
I had just come back
from my 8:00 fart.
Sure.
Go on.
Still no mail.
I think they only deliver it<br/>once a day.
Hey, listen,
when I moved in here,<br/>I sold all my stuff
because I know you like<br/>your place as is,
and I was totally fine<br/>with that.
Would it be okay
if instead of using<br/>your coffee mugs,
we use mine?
Hmm...
No.
Barney, she got rid<br/>of all of her stuff for you.
Oh, I see what this<br/>is really about.
Yeah, mugs.
Coffee?
Tea?
Eh, religion.
This is about the fact<br/>that you don't think
this relationship<br/>is gonna last.
That's why you don't want<br/>to throw anything out.
Because when<br/>that inevitable breakup comes,
you don't want to buy new mugs.
That's why I've never<br/>thrown anything out
for any relationship ever.
Isn't that right, honey?
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.
Lily, here's the thing.
It's my apartment,
and I need to assert<br/>my dominance as a man.
Don't ever say that...
to any girl ever.
Too late.
What did you just say to me?
- She gave up her apartment for you!<br/>- You said that to her?!
Okay, you know what?
I don't have to sit here and<br/>take this from you ladies.
I'm going to Ted's.
The man cave,
where guys can be guys.
- Assert your dominance?<br/>- It's like you have no respect for women.
- What is wrong with you?<br/>- You have a mother!
You guys, too?
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.
No, dude, hold on.
You're not going anywhere.
It's trilogy time.
- Kids, here's the deal-
It all started a long time ago<br/>in a dorm room far, far away.
Dude, if we fail<br/>this econ final,
for the rest of our lives<br/>we're not gonna be able to...
We won't know how to...
Do you even know what econ is?
No idea. We're screwed.
But there's only one thing<br/>left to do at at time like this.
Watch the entire Star Wars<br/>trilogy all the way through
because I haven't done that<br/>in, like, five years.
Dude, you can't let that happen.
If you're not trilling it<br/>at least once every three years,
the Dark Side wins.
Okay, let's make a pact.
No matter what,<br/>every three years,
we sit down<br/>and trill it up big time.
Agreed?
A-Greedo.
Wow.
2003, I mean...
What's that gonna be like?
Hey, Ted.
Sweet hair.
I told you it would<br/>eventually stop growing out
and start growing down.
Anyway, I'm just working
on designing<br/>yet another skyscraper.
And I'm carrying this briefcase
because now<br/>I'm a successful lawyer...
I like that.
Can I make one adjustment?
With a cool mustache.
Nice.
And who knows, by then,
you and Lily might be engaged.
Engaged? Bro, I'm gonna do<br/>way better than that.
Ah, being pregnant<br/>is so much fun.
I want to do this<br/>four more times.
Oh, baby, how do you feel
after spending all day<br/>working on your art,
since I make enough to<br/>support us both financially?
Horny.
I hope we don't<br/>bother you, Ted,
because even though<br/>we're married and pregnant,
it still makes sense
that we all share<br/>adult-sized bunk beds.
So, Star Wars?
Sure, I don't have to be at work<br/>until late afternoon-ish
because my boss appreciates that
I like to stay up late<br/>drinking and...
rocking out with our band.
Did someone say rocking out?
Whoa, who's the babe?
That's the best part.
Guys, you remember<br/>my awesome girlfriend
who was a virgin until we met?
Mm-hmm.
My name's Rhiannon,
like the Stevie Nicks song.
I'm hot, but in a crunchy,<br/>earthy kind of way.
Oh, and I'm from England.
Nice.
Okay, Star Wars time.
But first, we jam.
Good thing I spent<br/>the last three years
learning to wail on guitar.
Babe.
Yup, our band is<br/>gonna be in demand.
And luckily,<br/>there'll be plenty of supply.
Supply? Demand?
Dude, do you realize<br/>what we just did?
We used econ.
We're gonna ace this final.
We both got zeroes.
Oh, dude,
2003 is gonna be awesome.
"Satisfaction"?
"Hot Cross Buns."
Well, keep it up, bro.
So, you ready to watch<br/>the trilogy?
I don't know.
I mean, I really thought<br/>that by now I'd be a lawyer
with a kick-ass mustache,
but I still haven't even<br/>gotten into law school,
and my facial hair<br/>just grows in patchy.
Just red and patchy.
Come on.<br/>Your life's not that bad.
Dude, I manage a Structure.
But you get 10% off vests.<br/>That's something.
- The vests are pretty sweet, but, look...<br/>- Yeah.
Lily and I aren't married.
We don't have a baby<br/>on the way.
But we did get<br/>the cool apartment.
That we can barely afford.
I mean, I don't see<br/>any way that our lives
are better now than they<br/>were three years ago.
Oh, really, Marshall?<br/>Nothing comes to mind?
By the way, guys, this is Lisa.
You'll be seeing<br/>a lot more of Lisa.
And they never saw her again.
Whassaaaa!
Okay,
three years ago,<br/>we had this whole fantasy
about how great<br/>our lives were gonna be,
and it didn't pan out.
But I'm telling you,<br/>three years from now,
when we're watching<br/>the trilogy in 2006,
our lives are gonna be awesome.
Ah, hello, Ted.
I'm an environmental lawyer now.
Sure, it's not<br/>the most lucrative field,
but luckily I have<br/>the cash and prizes
from my historic seven-week run
on Wheel of Fortune...
Can I just make<br/>one little adjustment?
For which I was knighted<br/>by Her Majesty, the Queen.
Ah, Lady Aldrin.
Oh, Sir Marshall.
I cannot wait to get a house
down the street<br/>from your parents
so we can be close to your mom,<br/>whom I get along with now.
Good, good.
But here's the best part.
Rhiannon, hurry!
Just because I designed<br/>the opera house
doesn't mean they'll hold<br/>the curtain for us.
Just kidding.
Of course it does.
Take your time, my love.
Hey, guys, it's me again.
I'm pretty much<br/>the same as last time,
only now I'm super-rich<br/>and fancy.
And it still makes sense<br/>that we all live together.
What about you, Barney?
Any predictions for 2006?
Oh, yeah. Picture it.
By the way, guys, this is Jody.
You'll be seeing<br/>a lot more of Jody.
And they never saw her again.
Whassaaaa!
How is that any different<br/>from your life right now?
It's not. I'm KFC, baby.
You don't mess<br/>with the Colonel's recipe.
I want things to stay<br/>exactly the same,
but with a different hottie.
'Cause Barney don't slurp<br/>no sloppy seconds,
especially his own.
Okay, the bottom line is
things are gonna get better.
Well, all I care about is<br/>getting into law school.
You will.
2006 is gonna be awesome.
And look what happened.
You got into law school,
just like I said you would.
See, things aren't so bad.
Lily left me.
And now I'll never have<br/>a mustache.
Baby, there you are.
I have spent all day thinking<br/>about all the naughty,
naughty things<br/>you and I are gonna do
to cheer up Marshall.
Like what?
Um...
Uh, I'll you guys<br/>hang out, okay?
Um, I'll just be...
waiting in the bedroom.
Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>I-I didn't mean that
to sound like Ted and I are<br/>gonna do a kind of thing.
Okay, okay.
See you.
Marshall, this will pass.
Trust me.
Three years from now...
Briefcase, lawyer,
knighthood, mustache,
all that stuff from before.
Congratulations, bro.
And congratulations<br/>to you too, Ted,
for locking this down.
You know, it's weird,
I never thought I<br/>would get married,
but you talked me into it.
Or rather, banged me into it.
You're so good in bed, ooh.
How is this helping me?
I'm getting to it.
In three years, not only<br/>will Lily be back, but...
It's so nice to be married<br/>to a wonderful guy
and be carrying his child.
I think you're being<br/>kind of optimistic, Ted.
Can I make<br/>one little adjustment?
It's so nice to be married<br/>to a wonderful guy
and carrying his child,
and here he is now.
Guys, I want you to meet
some douchey guy named Trey.
- 'Sup, bro?<br/>- Mmm.
I don't know what I love more:
His thick mustache
or his trucker hat.
You know I hate those hats.
Then you're really gonna<br/>hate this sonogram.
Nooo...
ooo...!
A baby in a trucker hat.<br/>That's awesome.
Anyway, Ted's right.
2009's gonna rule.
By the way, guys, this is Maya.
You'll be seeing<br/>a lot more of Maya.
And they never saw her again.
Whassaaaa!
Okay, seriously,
at least tell me you're gonna
change the what will by then be
nine-year-old beer<br/>commercial reference.
I mean, come on.
There's got to be<br/>at least one way
that you'd like the future<br/>to be different.
I guess there is one thing.
By the way, guys, this is Maya.
You'll be seeing<br/>a lot more of Maya.
And not because of these these.
Because of these.
Back boobs--<br/>the visual stimulation
of missionary meets<br/>the emotional detachment
of doggy-style.
Patent pending.
Whassaaaa!
The point is, Marshall,
this time in three years,<br/>everything is gonna be great.
See? Lily came back.
Of course, Robin and I<br/>didn't end up together.
But I did get engaged.
And left at the altar.
But I did start<br/>my own architectural firm.
And it failed<br/>after a few months.
- Can we put the movie on, please?<br/>- Yeah.
Sure, buddy.
Hey, by the way,<br/>where is Robin?
In the summer of 2009,
Barney and Robin<br/>were secretly dating.
Oh, uh, Barney said she's<br/>taking some extension class
in how to decoupage,<br/>and Barney's taking
a different decoupage class<br/>in the same building.
That's why they shared<br/>that cab that one time.
We were idiots.
Wait a minute.
You're saying that Barney Stinson<br/>is at a decoupage class?
That means we can watch<br/>Star Wars on his giant TV!
Punch it, Chewy!
Oh.
You're back from decoupage.
What's decoupage?
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that<br/>cab there that one time.
Hold on.
Come on in.
We were hoping we could<br/>watch the trilogy here.
Uh, sure. But, uh...
first go look out<br/>my, uh, bedroom window.
There's a, uh...
naked lady, uh...
jumping up and down<br/>on a mini-trampoline
in the apartment<br/>across the, uh...
street.
Get me out of this thing!
There's no time!
Barney, I am not ready for them<br/>to find out about us.
Then you're gonna have to stay<br/>in there for the entire trilogy.
Don't worry. It's<br/>only 382 minutes.
Nerd!
So, where do you guys think<br/>we'll be in three years?
It'll be 2012.
That's an easy one.
Guys, this is Sophia.
You'll be seeing a lot more of...
Okay, that is so weird.
I was just trying<br/>to use the force.
Do you think instead<br/>of making a beer
fly out of the fridge,<br/>I made that lamp break?
Either that<br/>or the stormtrooper did it.
Oh, the stormtrooper<br/>would never do that.
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.
Anyway, while it's just us guys,
We've all had that same fantasy
about having sex with a girl in<br/>a stormtrooper costume, right?
- Mmm, no.<br/>- Never.
Guys...
come on, no girls around,<br/>just us bros.
Safe space.
Let's stop being polite<br/>and start gettin' real.
Stormtrooper fantasy.
Every guy's had that one, right?
Not even once, no.<br/>No, no, no.
So I'm the weird one?
Yeah.<br/>Yeah.
Yeah.
How about you, Ted?
How's your life gonna<br/>be different in three years?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Gonna meet a nice girl<br/>and get married.
I mean, I know I say that<br/>every year, but...
let's be honest,<br/>in 2012, I'll be 34.
If it still hasn't<br/>happened for me by then,
something is seriously<br/>wrong with me!
Something is seriously wrong<br/>with me.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't keep smiling
and being optimistic<br/>all the time
when all the evidence<br/>points to the contrary.
You really think<br/>that three years from now
things aren't gonna be awesome?
I'll tell you what<br/>things are gonna be like
three years from now.
Uh, yes, hello. I see
on my frozen entree for one<br/>they printed this number
where I can voice<br/>comments and concerns.
Well, there's more cinnamon
in the cobbler than usual.
No, I like cinnamon.
Oh, you're very welcome<br/>for my comment.
Wait! Uh, don't go.
Um... do you like cinnamon?
Hello? Hello?
Marshall, you want<br/>to watch Star Wars?
No, can do, old bean!
You see, we're up on the Cape
living the idyllic<br/>family lifestyle
that you've always dreamed of.
Oh, and I'm pregnant<br/>with baby #5!
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.
I'm just that good!
Oh, oh, hold on.
There's somebody wants<br/>to say hello to you.
Hey, Ted.
I just wanted to say<br/>that things are great,
and I'm married to that<br/>douchey guy in the trucker hat.
Whassup, bra?
It turns out it was just you
I didn't want to commit to.
Oh,
and I got back boobs.
So things are great!
Buh-bye!
By the way, Ted,<br/>this is Melanie.
You'll be seeing a<br/>lot more of Melanie.
Wait-wait-wait a minute!
Who is Melanie?
Come on, Barney, if there's<br/>one thing I can count on
not to change,<br/>it's you walking in
with some random<br/>girl on your arm.
No. No, I don't want that.
For the first time
in my life, I don't<br/>want to find myself
in three years<br/>with some random girl,
no matter<br/>how many boobs she has.
I want to be with Quinn.
Guys...
you're gonna be seeing<br/>a lot more of Quinn.
Dude, we've been to the<br/>Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty.
I kind of walked into that one.<br/>All right, bye-bye.
What are you doing?
We're living together,<br/>I'm excited about it,
and I'm getting rid of my mugs.
That was mine.
Sorry. I don't know<br/>which are which.
Truth is, I never<br/>drink coffee at home.
This one?<br/>Mm-hmm.
There!
I don't need my coffee mugs<br/>'cause I got yours!
For the rest of my life.
Or as... long as<br/>you'll have me.
We haven't really talked<br/>about the future.
Did I make things awkward?
Just keep smashing mugs.
Or donate them.
Point is,
I plan on being with you<br/>for a long time.
You okay with that?
Sounds great.
Ooh.. Oh!
I am so sorry.
No, no, it's great.
A guy has to be the first one<br/>to let 'er rip.
I was actually hoping<br/>this would happen soon.
I've been crop-dusting<br/>the patio for weeks.
- The patio!<br/>- Mm-hmm.
I've been going<br/>out on the street,
like, exactly this time<br/>every night.
Where are you, blond man?!
Show yourself!
I will be at my mother's.
We're a real couple now,<br/>aren't we?
We are.
Hey, buddy, I get<br/>that you're bummed.
But I got a good feeling<br/>about 2015.
I think that's<br/>gonna be your year.
Kids, that was the one time<br/>I ever lost faith
in the idea that my life<br/>would be better in three years.
And what's funny is,<br/>three years from that moment,
my life was amazing.
All right!<br/>It's trilogy time!
Can I just lodge one complaint?
This is a guy's tradition.
It's kind of a lame move<br/>on Ted's part to bring a chick.
Come on, dude...<br/>cut him some slack.
I know. He loves her.
She is pretty damn cute.
Thank God she takes<br/>after her mother.
All right,<br/>let's watch this thing!
TV...
play Star Wars trilogy.
Play Star Wars tril...
You know what?<br/>Screw it.
Okay, you are about to see<br/>something awesome.
And just know this:
Han shot first.
I wonder if things'll<br/>be a lot different
when we watch the trilogy<br/>again in 2018.
I hope not.
Oh, that was awesome.
You were right--<br/>not weird.
No.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">So, how's living alone?
You know, it's interesting.
When I first moved into<br/>my new apartment,
I was nervous.
For the first time in my adult<br/>life, I didn't have a roommate.
For the first time in my adult<br/>life, I didn't have a roommate!
If I want to walk around naked,<br/>nobody cares.
If I want to leave<br/>the laundry basket
in the middle of the living<br/>room, nobody stops me.
If I bring home soup<br/>from the deli
and leave it in the fridge<br/>for two days, nobody eats it.
And if I do something<br/>colossally stupid,
nobody ever has to know.
People make fun of the guy
who stays home every night<br/>doing nothing.
But the truth is...<br/>that guy's a genius.
Because let's be honest,<br/>sitting around watching TV,
drinking beer and eating ribs<br/>alone is what every
red-blooded American would<br/>rather be doing at all times.
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better<br/>to have someone to share the...
I mean, don't you<br/>get lonely without...
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.
What's the best thing
about dating a stripper,<br/>you ask?
Nope.
Just asked for your drink order.
I'll tell you the best thing<br/>about dating a stripper.
He'll just have a scotch.
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."
And I should go.
Time to make the doughnuts.
More like time to make some<br/>dough sitting on some nuts.
She's a stripper.
I'm dating her.
I'm dating a stripper.<br/>Barney wins.
I'll walk you out.
Hey, where are you going?
Quinn needs to get to work.<br/>She's a...
I know, a stripper, got it.
Hey, taxi!
My girlfriend's a stripper!
So, Ted, guess where we're<br/>having dinner Friday night.
Chez L'Argent.
I am so excited.
We've been trying forever<br/>to get this reservation.
Can you hold on<br/>for just one second?
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
Did you say you had to pee?
No.
But yeah, I do have to pee.
Man, this kid better be<br/>real freakin' cute!
What was that all about?
Lily had a sex dream last night.
Sex dream?<br/>Do tell.
I was painting<br/>the baby furniture...
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Hurry up,<br/>before Marshall gets home.
Oh, oh...
Whoa!
I'm sorry, baby.
Were you asleep?
All pregnant ladies<br/>have crazy sex dreams.
It's just her hormones<br/>going berserk.
So who's responsible for her<br/>rapid thigh movement this time?
Oh, my favorite was when<br/>she banged George Washington.
I liked the three-way with<br/>Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.
Oh, he smurfed<br/>the smurf out of her.
Yes, while The Cos<br/>smurfed off in the corner.
We all remember.<br/>But here's the thing.
When Lily has dirty dreams<br/>about other people,
she always tells me.
But this time...
Sounds like you<br/>had a crazy dream.
What was it about?
And then her face turned...
vermilion.
Just... you and me...
gettin' it on, monogamously.
Monoga-me-oh-my.
Not the rose quartz<br/>of the slightly embarrassed,
or the tomato red<br/>of the mildly abashed,
vermilion, the color<br/>of carnal shame.
Can only mean one thing:
Lily dream-banged<br/>someone we know.
Okay, you caught me<br/>vermilion-handed.
The truth is, I've spent<br/>the last five years
trying to inception your wife.
That movie only came out<br/>two years ago.
What movie?
You know who I bet it is?
Robin.
Already checked.
Lily and I paid her a visit
at the new World Wide News<br/>headquarters.
And I'm so excited,<br/>because I've been trying months
to get this reservation.
Can you hold on<br/>just one second?
What the hell are you doing?!
Nothing.
Nice photo.<br/>Oh.
Your passport must be enormous.
Ugh.
You know, for the record,<br/>I didn't want this.
Didn't want it,<br/>did not approve it.
It's super embarrassing.
Hey, Merle.
So, uh, do you guys<br/>want to come up and see my desk?
Yeah, why not?
Come on.
I.D.?
Oh. Um, that is me.
Ma'am, with all due respect,
you're a wee bit older<br/>than that hottie.
For God sakes.
You know, here I am,<br/>on national TV every day,
and still a guy who spends<br/>his whole life sitting next to
a giant picture of me<br/>has no idea who I am.
This isn't my whole life;<br/>I'm in a band.
And we're gonna make it.
And, kids, they did make it.
But I'll get to that later.
You know what, I'm probably not<br/>going to get to that later.
They had one song,<br/>it didn't suck, the end.
You always said<br/>it wasn't about being famous.
You just want to do<br/>solid journalism, right?
Yeah, well...
Of course I want to be famous!
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.
I was a cabinhold name.
But here?
Don't need to see<br/>your I.D., Merle.
Everyone knows who you are.
You're Merle.
He was in one skit<br/>in the Christmas party!
Uh, by the way,<br/>how is Ted doing?
Kids, you remember<br/>what happened.
I declared my love,<br/>she turned me down,
we both moved out of<br/>the apartment, and now...
I haven't talked to him<br/>since we... stopped talking.
He's pretty good.
Pretty good?
Last night, you ate<br/>a box of Froot Loops
in your tighty whities.
No, I demolished<br/>a box of Froot Loops,
fully nude.
Yeah, "pretty good" works.
Hey, Barney.
Hey, Lily.
Do you know what this is about?
Uh-huh.
Do I want to know?
No, sorry, bro.
Damn it!
Okay, time for my stuff.
Guys, I was sitting<br/>at home last night,
and all of a sudden,<br/>I had a piphany.
And my piphany was this...
Actually, it's, uh,<br/>it's "epiphany."
No, Ted, this is the piphany.
And here it is:
Make... every...<br/>night... legendary.
Guys, we've had
some pretty legendary nights.
But we've also had some nights<br/>that weren't so legendary.
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted<br/>Made Us All Watch Norbit.
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady;<br/>What's the problem?
That was Eddie Murphy?
The non-legendary<br/>nights are done.
From here on in, every<br/>single night of our lives
will be a night<br/>we'll never forget.
Starting tonight.
Who's ready for the longest,<br/>craziest adventure yet?!
Good.
The weak have been<br/>weeded from our herd.
You ready to rock<br/>and roll, Ted?
Yeah, I'm going home, too.
I'm sensing some costumes<br/>coming up here
and I'd rather steer clear.
Ted, 20 years from now,
when you're all alone<br/>and I'm President,
you're not gonna remember
sitting around your<br/>apartment doing nothing.
What you will remember<br/>is that tonight,
this night...
was The Night We Started<br/>a Mariachi Band!
Uno, dos, tres, quatro!
Okay, you were right.
Memorable night.
That was nothing<br/>compared to mañana, amigo.
Because mañana is gonna be...
The Night We Ate Everything<br/>on the Menu!
A really memorable night.
But tomorrow night...
Is The Night We Brought<br/>a Horse into the Bar!
Okay, but tomorrow...
Is The Night We Bungee Jump<br/>off the Statue of Liberty!
Nope.
That night was the night<br/>of Aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall's<br/>fancy dinner.
Complete with a fancy limo ride.
Surprise!
Hello!
Hi, Ranjit.
No.
Should I take the<br/>West Side Highway?
Why not, Ranjit?
Don't you always just<br/>take whatever you want,
regardless of<br/>anything but your own
dirty, sick, twisted appetites?
I'll stay on Broadway.
I.D.?
For God's sakes, open your...
Yeah, that's about right.
I.D.?
Robin had finally<br/>learned the lesson
that nobody<br/>gets famous overnight.
That night, she got famous.
Robin, there you are.
Sandy Rivers!
Star of the show.
What it is, my man.<br/>Yeah.
Robin, I've got<br/>something big for you,
something huge.
And I want you on it.
Sandy, you were<br/>in the harassment video.
You were great in that,<br/>by the way.
Thanks, holmes.
And I like the way
your filthy little mind works,<br/>Robin, but this is real.
Big story's breaking.
Are you afraid of helicopters?
I love helicopters.
What am I covering, a war?<br/>Better!
World Wide News<br/>brings you the world.
And now Robin Scherbatsky<br/>with traffic.
You don't want to go<br/>bungee jumping, fine.
Tonight's The Night<br/>We Stole a Mummy
from the Natural History Museum!
Yeah, I'm not doing that.
Then get out your MetroCard,<br/>Ted, because tonight's
The Night We Partied<br/>with the Mole People!
Barney, I have a Stouffer's<br/>lasagna for one in the freezer
that is going to be<br/>unforgettable.
I have a Sanford and Son<br/>on my DVR
that I will take with me<br/>to my grave.
I don't need tonight to be<br/>any more memorable than that.
Okay, Sanford and Son<br/>does sound good.
But if I could just present<br/>a counter argument...
You're locked out, dummy!
Damn it! Barney!
Give me your phone;<br/>I'm calling my super.
The only person we're calling<br/>is everyone we know,
because tonight's The Night<br/>We Tracked Down Phil Collins,
Became Best Friends with Him,<br/>and Talked Him into Reuniting
with Peter Gabriel,<br/>So Then We Got to Sing Backup
On The New Genesis Album<br/>and It Was Awesome!
Fine, I'll use the<br/>phone at the bar.
Ranjit, would you please<br/>put up the partition?
Partition going up.
You had a sex dream<br/>about Ranjit!
Hello.
Ranjit!
Sorry.
Okay, yes, I did,
but it didn't mean anything.
Okay, well, what<br/>happened in this dream?
And I want to know everything.
Every explicit detail.
Don't leave out any...
Damn it, Ranjit!
Sorry.
Marshall, it was a dream.
Yeah, well, dreams<br/>are just stuff
that you subconsciously<br/>want to happen.
Why do you think<br/>I'm constantly dreaming
about Bigfoot playing<br/>quarterback for the Vikings?
Because you fall asleep<br/>looking at a painting of it.
It soothes me.
Don't try to change the subject.
You sleep-cheated.
You've been<br/>sleep-sleeping around,
and I'm sick of it.
You know, I have half a mind
to get out and let you<br/>eat all by yourself.
Should I pull over?
Damn it, Ranjit!
Yes, Ranjit.<br/>Pull over.
Pulling over.
You watch, Ted.
Tonight is going<br/>to be legen--
it's the night<br/>we stole a camel...
which means it'll be<br/>full of drama-- dary.
Dromedary!
I applaud your wordplay,<br/>but your core premise is flawed.
Every night can't be legendary.
If all nights are legendary,<br/>no nights are legendary.
See, Ted,<br/>that attitude right there,
that's why I'm in the lead.
What do you mean, in the lead?
I'm talking about<br/>the game of life, Ted.
Scoreboard.
75 points.
90 points.
110 points.
Sorry. Did you just make up<br/>this point system?
114 points.
And ten points to you<br/>for pointing that out.
Nice job, Ted.
15 points to me<br/>for being gracious enough
to give you those ten points.
But here's the point, Ted.
Every time I go out
and have an awesome night<br/>and you're not there,
that's another 100 points<br/>in my column.
So yeah, I'm in the lead.
Barney, the fact that I<br/>can stay home for a night
shows that I have inner peace
and that I don't feel<br/>the need to keep score.
That's worth like<br/>1,000 points right there,
so at the very<br/>least, we're tied.
We're so not tied.
Although you know<br/>what is tied--
the strap<br/>of my girlfriend's bikini.
Except when it's not,<br/>'cause she's a stripper.
One million points!<br/>Game.
Shh.
It's over.
It's done. It's done.
So what do you do?
You're kidding, right?
I... I'm an on-air reporter.
I just did a report<br/>like five minutes ago.
You sound frustrated.
Yeah, I am.
I'm busting my ass,<br/>and as usual, no recognition.
Robin, I've been<br/>doing this a while,
and if there's one thing<br/>I've learned, it's flarm.
What?<br/>Flarm.
Flarm, flarm, flarm.
Blobbum.
What is wrong with you?
Are you having a stroke?
As a matter of fact, he was.
Oh! Hold on! Wait!
Meanwhile, Lily was in
desperate need<br/>of a female friend.
Lily, I have seen this<br/>a million times.
Guys go crazy when there's<br/>a baby on the way.
You should have seen the manager<br/>when his wife got pregnant.
After the second trimester,<br/>he made her stop stripping.
Yeah, you're right.
Now I feel bad.
Our big dinner's been ruined.
Marshall's<br/>probably crying right now.
I had no idea that<br/>food could be this delicious.
Marshall, you are being crazy.
No, no, I can handle it.
If I sell my laptop,
we can get seconds<br/>on those squash blossoms.
I mean about Lily.
Well, you know,<br/>she's being crazy, too.
She's pregnant.
She gets to be crazy.
You have to be the sane one.
So what, I don't get to be<br/>crazy again
until the baby comes?
No. Then it's baby's turn<br/>to be crazy.
When do I get to be crazy again?
Never.
We are totally even.
We absolutely are not even,<br/>and here's why.
I'll grant you<br/>that if you include
the 12 points<br/>for designing the skyscraper,
the 83 points for slapping five<br/>with Tommy Lee
and the 9,000 points<br/>for banging Robin before me,
our point totals<br/>would be about neck and neck,
but there's one thing<br/>you're forgetting.
The fact that I don't care?
No.
And you just lost five points<br/>for sass.
Do you remember a conversation<br/>we had about three years ago?
Barney, you're the king.
Nobody picks up chicks like you.
You're handsome,
debonair,
everything I wish I could be.
I'm starting to think<br/>this never happened.
Let you finish.
You're smooth, charismatic,
"sauve."
I think you mean "suave."
Aha.
So you do remember.
But there's one thing
even a master ladies' man<br/>like you could never do,
and if you could ever do it,
it would be worth 500 points.
You have my attention,<br/>my slightly shorter friend.
Here's the challenge.
Get a girl's phone number<br/>while you're wearing a dress.
Challenge...
Accomplished.
That's right.
Last year,<br/>I slapped on a dress,
took a few laps<br/>around this very bar,
and I got this:
The phone number<br/>of one Stephanie McColgan.
Later that night,<br/>I took off my pantyhose,
and gave her panties...<br/>my hose.
That's right, Ted.
I am 500 points ahead.
Until you can get<br/>a girl's digits
while wearing a dress,<br/>you and I will never be even.
You know what? The super's<br/>probably waiting for me,
and I just remembered<br/>there's a spare key
under the doormat, so good night.<br/>Wait, wait.
Ted, don't go.<br/>Barney, I am leaving.
I'm afraid this is just<br/>one of those nights
we're probably going to forget.
I don't think so, dude. Look.
If you're just joining us,<br/>the World Wide News
Eye in the Sky traffic chopper<br/>is out of control over Manhattan
and being piloted<br/>by our own Robin Scherbatsky.
This probably won't end well.
Kids, every now and then,<br/>New York has a moment
when every eye in the city<br/>is watching the same thing.
This was one of those moments.
We all watched breathlessly<br/>as the pilot on the ground
told her what to do,<br/>and against all odds,
your Aunt Robin<br/>landed that helicopter.
I did it.
I did it!
The pilot survived<br/>and made a full recovery.
And Robin?
It's Robin Scherbatsky,<br/>everybody!
Thank you so much.
Oh, okay...
Robin got famous.
In the next few days,<br/>she would...
meet the mayor,
go on Letterman
and even have a deli sandwich<br/>named after her.
But most importantly,<br/>that night,
she got a call, text or e-mail
from almost everyone<br/>she'd ever met.
Hey, Marshall.
Hey, Lil.
Hey, Barney.
Yes, I know<br/>you're dating a stripper.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Dad.
You proud of your little girl?
Okay, I'll keep trying.
Babe, I think<br/>I know why you had
that sex dream about Ranjit.<br/>Why?
Think about it.
The way he talks<br/>about his kids.
He's a wonderful father.
Just like Papa Smurf,<br/>Bill Cosby...
George Washington,<br/>the father of our country.
You're attracted to great dads.
And that's why you love me.
Because I'm going to be<br/>the greatest dad ever.
Sure, that must be it.
Lily decided<br/>not to tell Marshall
about her dream<br/>involving Frankenstein
and the tea cup<br/>from Beauty and the Beast.
That one was just for her.
Okay, Barney, I got to go.
What?
In the middle of
"The Night You Got Locked Out<br/>in Your Pajamas
"and Robin Landed<br/>a Freaking Helicopter
and There's Still Time<br/>to Reunite Genesis?"
Dude, you got your wish.
It's a night<br/>we'll always remember.
Why can't we just go home?
I can't go home, Ted.<br/>Why not?
Because...<br/>I'm dating a stripper.
Yes, I've seen your bus ad.
I get it.
No, you don't.
Every night, between 9:00 p.m.<br/>and 4:00 a.m.,
I'm in hell.
All I can think about<br/>is what Quinn is doing
and where she is doing it<br/>and who she is doing it on.
If I don't do something<br/>to take my mind off of it...
You're lucky that you can just<br/>go sit around the house, Ted.
I don't have that option.
Wow.
You're in love with this girl.
I really am, Ted.
I mean...
she's a stripper.
Later that night...
The next night,
all I wanted to do<br/>was enjoy a night at home.
But there was something<br/>I had to do.
It wasn't easy,
but by God,<br/>after a long night of trying...
Okay.
Now we're even.
500 points.
Scoreboard.
More than a legendary night
we'd remember forever,
Uncle Barney needed a bro<br/>to help him forget.
In this case, a bro in a dress.
I'm proud of you.
Are you wearing perfume?
It's a unisex fragrance.<br/>It was in Details.
It's nice.<br/>It's perfume.

[<div class="full-script">[Ted Narrating]<br/>In May of 2012...
Marshall and Lily hosted a baby shower<br/>in the apartment.
All their friends were there.
So, of course, I made sure<br/>to show up exactly-
- [Knocking]<br/>- three hours late.
Oh, no.
- Am I late?<br/>- Little bit.
Oh, I 'm so sorry.<br/>I would have gotten here earlier. It's just, um-
- You didn't want to see Robin.<br/>- I didn't want to see Robin.
I know, it's childish.<br/>She's not here, is she?
Actually-
Oh, no. Am I early?
Little bit.
Whoa. She got you the red stroller?
Looks like I just blew her<br/>out of the water.
Anyway, she left before the party started.
Ah.
I'm really sorry.
I just think it's best if Robin and l<br/>don't see each other for a while.
Ted, it's fine. I'm a child of divorce.
You guys keep fighting all you want,<br/>as long as the expensive gifts keep coming.
Uh, so how was the shower?
It was good.
Although there was one weird moment<br/>with Barney's new stripper girlfriend.
Fifty laps a day?
Oh, my goodness, young lady,<br/>that is a lot.
Oh, is it?
Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?
- Yes, my girlfriend gets naked...<br/>- ## ["Battle Hymn of the Republic"]
and sits on guys' laps for money.
And, yes, sometimes it's as many<br/>as 50 laps in one day.
And maybe society considers<br/>what she does to be "disgusting."
Or "slutty."
Or verging on "prostitution."
Or "actual prostitution."
But you know what? I accept her.
And if you can't do the same...
well, then shame on you.
Shame... on... you.
- ## [Ends]<br/>- We were, um, talking about swimming-
how I sometimes swim 50 laps a day.
Well, it's great cardio.<br/>Lois, can I top off your champagne?
## [Upbeat Pop]
## [Man Vocalizing]
## [Ends]
You know, it's funny.
You tell the average guy<br/>you're dating a stripper...
he thinks it's awesome.
Heck, you tell your mom,<br/>she high-fives you so fast...
she doesn't even take off her oven mitts.
But if they had any idea<br/>how difficult it is-
the jealousy, the insecurity-
those high fives<br/>would be high fives of condolence.
Barney, condolence high fives<br/>are not a thing.
They're a thing.
I'm afraid we're gonna<br/>have to let you go.
Up top.
Ah, listen to me<br/>and my boring couples' problems.
How are you?
- How's the single life?<br/>- I wouldn't know.
After this whole Robin thing,<br/>for the time being, I'm layin' low.
Laying low, as in sleeping<br/>with a really short chick?
- Hmm.<br/>- You guys doin' 39?
I mean I'm not seeing anyone.
I'm just trying to get Robin<br/>out of my head.
You need a palate cleanser.
Barney, please...
don't try to set me up<br/>with Quinn's stripper friends.
- I wouldn't dream of it.<br/>- Why not?
How many hints do I have to drop?
No, I'm thinking of something<br/>much more traditional-
- online dating.<br/>- Yeah. No, thanks.
Come on, Ted, it's 2012.
What do you expect-<br/>to meet some cute travel agent...
when you're readin' a newspaper<br/>at a bookstore?
None of those things exist anymore.
Barney, I will never,<br/>ever, ever try online dating.
[Ted Narrating]<br/>That night, I tried online dating.
And, kids, the first girl I found<br/>was amazing-
beautiful, smart, funny...
huge fan of pre-war architecture.
Favorite poet- Neruda.<br/>Favorite movie- Ghostbusters.
And she didn't hate Cleveland.
She's perfect.
So I sent her an e-mail<br/>inviting her to... mini golf.
[Typing]
[Rings]
- [Beeps]<br/>- Hello.
[Barney] Mini golf?<br/>Who takes a first date to mini golf?
I'm comin' over!
- Oh, Ted, Ted, Ted, Teddy, Ted, Ted.<br/>- Who buzzed you in?
Did you really think you could start<br/>dating online and I wouldn't find out?
But- Wha- Th-This girl, she-she was-
Me. She was me, Ted.
The photo was just of some girl<br/>I knew you'd never seen before-
a very famous sports anchor on ESPN.
Barney, I don't need you<br/>to help me find a girl online.
Exactly, because I've already done it.
Three girls, in fact.
I scoured the dating sites<br/>using my own personal logarithms...
factoring in a broad spectrum<br/>of variables...
filtering out undesirable<br/>high-risk negatives...
guaranteeing a success rate of 83-
You picked the girls<br/>that showed the most boob.
My methods get results.
Go out with these three girls...
and your palate is going to be so cleansed,<br/>you will see your reflection in it.
And when you do...
you can fix the hair, because-<br/>Have you seen yourself?
No. But you know what I have seen?
Your stripper girlfriend's cans. Wow.
- Wow.<br/>- Wow, wow.
That was going way too far, wasn't it?
I'm sorry. My condolences.
Come on.
Man, Marshall's really<br/>stressing out about this baby.
He's reading every book,<br/>watching breast-feeding documentaries.
I woke up the other day,<br/>he had swaddled me.
Sure, it was the best night's sleep<br/>I have had in months, but still-
You know what his latest thing is?
[Klaxon Blaring]
- What the hell is that?<br/>- [Continues]
[Muffled Grunting]
- [Stops]<br/>- Marshall, what is that?
I rigged this alarm<br/>to go off every three hours.
I'm training myself for the sporadic<br/>sleep patterns of early parenthood.
Now if you'll excuse me,<br/>I have a practice baby to soothe.
- You got to talk to him.<br/>- Yeah, I'll talk to him tonight.
- Maybe tomorrow morning.<br/>- One last swaddle?
It's just so cozy.<br/>It's like sleeping in a warm burrito.
[Ted Narrating]<br/>Meanwhile, Barney was about to have...
a stripper's boyfriend's worst nightmare.
Karma? Oh, my gosh.
I didn't recognize you<br/>without your legs behind your head.
Darryl. I didn't recognize you<br/>without your creepy trench coat.
- How are you?<br/>- Great. You working tomorrow?
- You know it.<br/>- Great. I'll be there with bells on.
And by "bells,"<br/>I mean super-thin sweatpants.
- [Both Laughing]<br/>- Gross.
He's actually a nice guy.
He's so busy as deputy mayor,<br/>but I always get a card on my birthday.
Quinn, I love the fact<br/>that you're a stripper...
but I hate the fact<br/>that you're a stripper.
Barney, I like my job...
and I do not need to be rescued.
So don't be that guy.
You're right. You're right. I got it.
Forget I said anything.
- I'll see you tonight, Karma?<br/>- You got it, Dirty Larry.
You have to quit your job!
[Ted Narrating] That night, I went out<br/>with the first girl Barney picked for me.
There was just one problem.
Your name is Robin?
Yeah. With a "Y."<br/>[Chuckles]
Oh, "Yobin. "
No, Robyn.
I go by "Scotch and Gun Lover"<br/>in my online profile...
'cause those are my two favorite things.
Well, next to Canada,<br/>my home and native land.
Oh. Canada.
[Ted Narrating]<br/>And just like that...
Robyn became Robin.
How's it goin', Ted?
Oh, good. Hey, look,<br/>Mommy's back from the bar.
- [Door Closes]<br/>- Now I can finally take a shower.
- [Sighs]<br/>- [Kiss]
This diaper smells. I don't want to know.
Okay, Marshall, sit down. We need to talk.
[Sighs]<br/>Look, I know you mean well...
but we have five weeks till the due date.
Can't we use this time to just relax?
We'll figure out how all this stuff works<br/>after the baby comes.
After the baby comes?
Yeah, we'll learn on the job.
Learn on the jo- Huh.
Wow. You know, Lily, maybe the crisis here<br/>isn't that I'm not ready to be a dad.
Maybe it's that<br/>you're not ready to be a mom.
- Excuse me?<br/>- Yeah, you-
[Ted Narrating]<br/>With that, an argument began...
the details of which<br/>are still hotly debated to this day.
For instance, Uncle Marshall<br/>swears he never said-
I 'm the only one making sacrifices<br/>for this baby.
- What?<br/>- And he claims he never<br/>actually uttered the words-
It's like you don't even know<br/>that you're pregnant.
While Lily insists<br/>this part was exaggerated.
Babies are easy. You just watch 'em<br/>be cute and feed 'em spaghetti.
But everyone agrees<br/>this is how the argument ended.
Marshall, what I need now<br/>is some peace, some quiet...
and- now that it's out there-<br/>some spaghetti.
Now please help me off the couch<br/>so I can storm out.
Huh!
[Ted Narrating] The next day,<br/>I filled Barney in on my date.
Oh, Yobin.
No, Robyn.
And for the rest of the night, every time<br/>I looked at her, I just saw Robin's face.
Well, I should hope so.
No, our Robin. Robin with an "l."
Uh, our Robin has two eyes, my friend.
But that's good.<br/>You're forgetting what she looks like.
I'm sorry. That must have been tough.
If anyone knows<br/>what that feels like, it's me.
My condolences.
Okay, moving on.
Next girl, perfect palate cleanser.<br/>Nothing like Robin.
How nothing?
I gaze out into the world...
and all I see is an icy place<br/>where dreams die.
Ooh, lasagna.
How's it goin', Ted?
What? No! What- Wha- Why?
Remember? I made lasagna that one time.
That's all it takes?<br/>It wasn't even lasagna.
You took your botched kugel<br/>and poured tomato sauce on it.
I didn't say it was good lasagna.
By the way,<br/>what are you doing with this girl?
With tattoos all up and down her arms<br/>and everywhere else.
Hello. Good gravy.
Does that dragon's tail<br/>go all the way down to her-
Oh, yes, it does.
Well, what do you want me to do, Robin?
I have to get over you somehow,<br/>and if this is what it takes-
Are you okay?
Yeah. Why?
You kind of spaced out there. Weirdo.
"So in summation, I'm very, very sorry.
I guess I just wanted you all to myself...
and then I thought<br/>of all the creepy guys groping at your-
Okay, I'm getting mad again,<br/>so I'm going to stop writing now.
Please enjoy these chocolates.<br/>May contain peanuts."
Kiss and make up?
[Chuckles]
Have sex up against the window<br/>and make up?
[Laughs]<br/>Well, you do have a great view.
Well, funny you should mention that.<br/>It's your view.
Come again for Big Fudge?
Congratulations. You're hired.
You are Goliath National Bank's<br/>newest executive strategy coordinator.
What is an executive strategy coordinator?
It's three corporate-sounding words<br/>which, when added together...
equal a fake job<br/>for which you get a real paycheck...
in the amount<br/>of exactly what you'd make stripping.
Plus dental. You're "welcs."
Now about that up-against-the-window sex-
- Dude, I don't want to work for a bank.<br/>- Why not?
Because I have standards.<br/>You people are whores.
The things you're willing to do<br/>just for some money, it's shameful.
You work in a strip club.
Yeah, and I like it, and I'm good at it.
Barney, if I took this job,<br/>you would own me.
I would be willingly<br/>stepping into a cage...
which is something I don't do.
Except on Thursdays,<br/>when it's cage night at the Lusty Leopard...
but that's a cardboard cage,<br/>and I can get out of it any time I want.
You can?
Wow. Thanks for ruining cage night.
- Come on, Quinn.<br/>- No.
- I wouldn't-<br/>- No. Don't.
I think I have some thinking to do.
I-<br/>[Sighs]
Mr. Stinson, does this mean<br/>I get to keep my job?
[Sighs]<br/>Yeah, Herm, you can stay.
Hey, baby, listen,<br/>I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.
No, that's okay.
To be fair, maybe I'm at fault<br/>for loving our child too much...
although that is the definition<br/>of parenting, so-
All right, good makeup.<br/>Hey, listen, I went online...
and I found this baby boot camp thing...
that they're doing at a hotel<br/>in Paramus this weekend.
Baby boot camp? That sounds great.
- Yeah, it's a two-day event.<br/>- We're going.
- And there's lots of seminars and classes.<br/>- You've already made the sale.
- Anyway, I signed us up.<br/>- Not even listening anymore.
Mentally packing and trying to figure out<br/>the best way to get to Paramus...
without hitting any tolls.<br/>This is gonna be great!
And that was the last time I'll ever<br/>go out with a guy with a mustache.
[Both Laugh]
[Thinking]<br/>This is good. This is nice.
Not thinking about you-know-who.
Just having a good time...
and thanking God<br/>I didn't grow that mustache.
And you, you're so polite.
My ex-fianc?, Wayne, he had no manners.
[Thinking]<br/>Wayne had no manners. Wayne Manners.
Wayne Manor, home of Bruce Wayne...
better known as Batman...
mentor to Dick Grayson,<br/>his orphaned ward...
who at night would don the colorful<br/>vestments of the Boy Wonder, a. k. a. -
Robin!
Holy long walk<br/>for a short drink of water, Ted.
Stop this. I need you<br/>out of my life for real.
- You don't mean that.<br/>- Yes, I do.
No, you don't.<br/>Look how much is changing right now.
Marshall and Lily are having a baby.
Barney's shacking up with a girl.
With your whole world<br/>turning upside down...
isn't a friendship like this one...
something you want to hold onto<br/>as tightly as possible?
Every time I look at you, it hurts.
And that's the story<br/>of my only lesbian experience.
I'm sorry for going into so much detail.
I'll never tell that story again.
Anyway, how's your meal?
Holly, listen,<br/>I should probably tell you, um...
I'm kind of getting over someone right now.
I am so glad you said that.
I guess I'm still getting over Wayne.<br/>It's been really hard.
Can I interest you in some sorbet?
You two look like<br/>you could both use a palate cleanser.
Ohh.<br/>[Exhales]
How's your palate, Ted?
Pretty cleansed.
[Both Chuckle]
Oh. You know, at this seminar,<br/>there's gonna be the one guy<br/>who's like Mr. Parenting Expert.
Keeps interrupting the speakers<br/>with his own "important facts."
And you're gonna be sittin' right next to him,<br/>so get ready for that.
Baby, you've been<br/>a little sleep deprived lately.
Why don't you let me drive?
You know what? That's not such a bad idea.
I mean, the last thing we want is<br/>for me to get behind the wheel and just-
[Snoring]
[Chuckles, Sniffs]
Mmm.<br/>[Sniffs]
Oh, baby, you smell good.
When we get to that hotel, I'm gonna<br/>wear your pregnant belly like a hat.
You'll have to buy me<br/>a couple of cocktails first.
Bar-Barney? Where are we.
Atlantic City, baby!
Well, in 14 miles.
What the hell is going on?
And where is Lily?
And what did you do to the practice baby?
And is there any left?
Lily was worried about you.<br/>She thought you needed to unwind, so-
I mean, the last thing we want is for me<br/>to get behind the wheel and just-
[Snoring]
[Barney Narrating] She made reservations<br/>for two deluxe rooms, massages...
and dinner at The Palm,<br/>and, in return, I made her cookies.
So there's no baby boot camp<br/>at the Paramus Waldorf?
Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?
Bro.
I am so mad at Lily right now.
She knew you would be.<br/>That's why she packed this.
Oh. My "mad at Lily" shirt.
I had this made for me<br/>and my high school girlfriend, Steph.
In reality, "Marshall and Steph forever"...
turned out to be<br/>"Marshall and Steph for two days...
until Steph's boyfriend<br/>got out of juvie a week early."
Drives Lily crazy when I wear it.
I hope she's miserable without me.
- Hey, Ted. How's tricks?<br/>- Tricks are pretty good, Lou.
Had some girl trouble<br/>earlier in the week, but, uh...
I got a feelin', from here on out, things<br/>are gonna be A-o- You son of a bitch!
Hello.
- [All Cheer]<br/>- Yeah!
Lily's right.
- I've been acting crazy.<br/>- Nah, it's okay, bro.
I mean, yeah, you've been a little crazy.
But it comes from love.
It's the same kind of crazy that makes<br/>a man offer his stripper girlfriend...
over half a million dollars<br/>of government bailout money...
not to rub up on other guys' junk.
It's good crazy.
[All Groaning]
- I hope Lily's okay.<br/>- Okay.
You know, that's it, bro. We're both<br/>turnin' off our phones for one hour.
Motion denied.
Okay, you leave me no choice.
Proposal: You give me one hour<br/>of phone-free bro time...
during which we- and by we, I mean you-
get magnificently, mythologically drunk.
I'm talkin' needing subtitles<br/>when you speak drunk.
If you can give me that...
I will wear this.
The-The ducky tie?<br/>I thought you threw that thing away.
I did.
It came back.
All right, Barney.<br/>You got yourself a deal.
[Laughs]
Um, excuse me, miss.
Um, when you get a chance, could you bring<br/>over a hundred shots of tequila, please?
I'll have the same.
- Why are you still here?<br/>- Why do you think I'm still here?
I guess because I'm in love with you.
Why else would I be seeing your face<br/>everywhere I look?
Because you feel bad.
Of course I feel bad.
I told you I love you, which is apparently<br/>the worst thing you can say to someone.
That's not why you feel bad.
You feel bad because after you said it,<br/>you let me go away.
I know our relationship<br/>isn't exactly what you want it to be.
And I know I may not love you<br/>the way you love me...
but I do love you.
Isn't that worth hanging onto?
[Sighs]
I miss you.
So go get me back.
Ohh! Ahh!
- Robin.<br/>- Ted.
It's good to really see you.<br/>I mean, it's really good to see you.
Look, I think we need to talk.
- Uh, me, too, but now's not a good time.<br/>- Why not?
I am proud of you, bro.
You turned off your phone for one hour,<br/>and you got so drunk-
[Mumbling]
Exactly.
Hey, Zed.
Yes, Marshall?
[Mumbling]
Well, I don't see why not.
[Beeps]
Whoa! I've got 17 new voice mails.
Barney, it's Lily. You guys need to<br/>get back to New York right away.
I'm in labor.
Whoo! All hail Beercules!<br/>[Laughing]
Yeah!<br/>[Laughs]
All right, Barney.<br/>You got yourself a deal.
[Laughs]
- Hey. You've reached Marshall.<br/>Please leave a message.<br/>- [Beeps]
Hey, baby, it's me.
I think I'm in labor.
[Laughs]<br/>We should do this every weekend.
- [Beeps]<br/>- Okay, this is real.
It's not a false alarm.<br/>This is real. I'm in labor.
I kind of need you to call me back now.
How does somebody so little<br/>have such strong fingers?
- [Beeps]<br/>- Where are you? Call me!
He is the manager of the Paramus Waldorf.
You come to Paramus, we will hook you up!
- [Beeps]<br/>- If you're trying to get back at me...
you have chosen<br/>a wildly inappropriate way of doing so!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, when Aunt Lily<br/>went into labor,
Marshall was somewhere<br/>slightly inconvenient,
in Atlantic City<br/>with Uncle Barney,
and drunk to the point of<br/>talking like Yoda.
Baby come...
Papa gonna be am I...
Hospital must we get now...
Okay, there's like a four-hour<br/>wait at the valet stand.
Plus, we're in no shape to<br/>drive. So, a car's out...
Wait, don't worry. We'll take<br/>a cab to the train station.
Yeah, good luck getting a cab.
It's impossible because<br/>of the big thing.
Kids, for the life of<br/>me, I can't remember
what the big thing was in<br/>Atlantic City that weekend.
Was it<br/>a cheerleading convention?
No, it was a porn convention.
Sci-fi convention?
Eh, I can't remember.
- We're stuck in Atlantic City!<br/>- City of Atlantic stuck in are we.
Okay, Lily,<br/>it's going to be fine.
We are not freaking out.<br/>We are not freaking out!
I feel calmer already.<br/>Let's get you to the hospital.
Oh, I can't go yet.<br/>I talked to Dr. Sonya.
They won't admit me<br/>until my contractions
are four minutes apart.
Okay, well, if you<br/>don't make it in time,
I have got you covered. When I<br/>was 13, my father caught me
kissing a boy, so he sent me<br/>to our family's ranch
for foaling season.<br/>Once you see a baby horse
erupt through that birth canal,<br/>you stop even touching yourself.
Anyway, I had skinny arms,<br/>so I got up there elbow deep.
I lost this watch<br/>birthing Blacky...
Okay, stop it. I am not<br/>a farm animal.
Oh, there we go.<br/>Easy girl. Sugar cube?
Oh, okay.
Ah, don't worry, Lil.
Some of us know what<br/>a woman actually needs
at a time like this.
A kick-ass<br/>labor announcement e-mail.
A man,
a woman,
and their best friend,
embark on an<br/>incredible journey.
Lily's cervix is dilating,<br/>and we want you all
to be part of its<br/>grand opening.
You are not sending that<br/>to anyone, ever.
So what I need right now is<br/>distraction from the pain.
Just tell me a story.
Uh, what story?<br/>I don't care. Anything.
How about the worst<br/>cab ride ever?
Clean your window for you? - No!
Hey, get off my cab!
Oh! Oh, God!
Oh! Ah!
We are not panicking!<br/>We are not panicking!
Get on all fours;<br/>It widens your hind quarters.
Stop it! I am not<br/>a farm animal!
But give me that sugar cube.
Okay, listen, I am going to<br/>get you to that hospital
or die trying.<br/>And if I succeed,
I ask only one thing in return.
You can't have sex with Lily.
I ask only a second thing in return.
We're not naming our child Barney!
I ask only a third thing in return.
Let me choose<br/>your child's middle name.
Because I have thought up the<br/>most awesome name of all time.
What's the middle name?
Wait for it...
I'm waiting.
Wait for it...
I said I'm waiting.
Wait for it.<br/>What's the middle name?
No, the middle name is<br/>"Wait For It."
Let's say his first name is,<br/>oh, I don't know, Barney.
He'd be Barney<br/>"Wait For It" Eriksen.
How awesome is that?
That is...
the coolest...<br/>middle name of all time.
I know!<br/>Okay, listen.
I have a plan<br/>to get us to New York.
All we have to do is get our<br/>hands on that motorcycle.
And I know just the way<br/>to do it.
Here.
Oh. Hi, Judy.
Oh, good.<br/>You got the e-mail from Ted.
No, I am not worried my<br/>city hips are too narrow,
and-and your grandson's<br/>going to get stuck.
I got to go.
I thought you deleted<br/>that stupid e-mail.
Okay, I sent it by accident.
- She like it?<br/>- Yes!
Just keep telling me stories!
Second base with Neil Young.
Um,
I don't normally go to, um,<br/>second base and tell,
but I just spent<br/>a magical night with Neil Young.
He's still in my room.
- Seriously?<br/>- Oh, my God.
Be cool guys, don't scare him off.
He-Hey...
- Robin...<br/>- Yeah.
That's not Neil Young.
Oh, God.
Oh, we're busting apple bags?<br/>I can bust apple bags.
Ted, remember when we were<br/>dating and we threw that party
and one of those appetizers<br/>just didn't sit right?
Ah... doesn't sound familiar.
I call this story "Ted and<br/>the Cuban Sandwich Crisis."
Ted came out of that<br/>bathroom looking like
Joe Frazier after<br/>the Thrilla in Manila.
Oh, what is that smell!?
Ugh!
So I, being a great girlfriend,<br/>tried to help him out.
You guys are all crazy;<br/>I don't smell anything.
Anyway, uh, who wants to<br/>go up on the roof?
But then...
She, who denied it, supplied it.
Yeah, must have been that<br/>Cuban sandwich, huh, babe?
That was not cool, Ted.
Contraction!
That wasn't cool, Ted?
Just keep going<br/>with the stories.
I don't even care<br/>if I've heard it before.
Just tell me, uh,<br/>"Where Does That Door Go?"
Okay.
Hey, I've never noticed<br/>that door before.
I wonder where it goes.
- Ted.<br/>- Ted.
No, no, no, let him...<br/>let him...
Wow...
- Don't...<br/>- No...
Robi...
Oh...
Wow...
Dad, oh, good.
Let me guess,<br/>you got Ted's e-mail.
- I'm on my way, Princess.<br/>- Dad, wait, no, not...
Damn it, Ted.
I was okay with you e-mailing<br/>my aunt, my cousins,
and your cousins, and the guy<br/>that Robin thought was Neil Young.
But my father is the absolute<br/>worst person to have around
in any sort of<br/>medical situation.
When I was seven, I needed
to have my tonsils out.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Aw, Princess, I would be too.<br/>I've researched this surgery.
Anything can happen.<br/>You could bleed to death...
you could have your jaw<br/>removed due to infection,
and the anesthesia could<br/>suddenly just stop working,
much like your mom's<br/>and my marriage.
You do know that we're<br/>getting a divor...
Don't worry about it. We'll talk<br/>about it after the surgery.
Calm down, girl.
Okay, for the last time,<br/>I am not...
Actually, keep going.
Okay, I admit the whole "win a<br/>motorcycle plan" was stupid.
Especially because we've been<br/>playing on the wrong machine.
Meet me at the entrance<br/>in five minutes.
Hop on, Marshall.<br/>Tonight, we ride!
You won that?
Not exactly. You see, I...
Get off!
I hope Marshall's close.<br/>Cube me.
I'm on my way, Lily Pad.
Kids, your Uncle Marshall
has faced many challenges<br/>in his life.
But he still considers<br/>getting up these two steps
when he was this drunk to be<br/>the hardest one of all.
Tell me a Marshall story.<br/>I miss him.
Got it.<br/>"The Tale of the Cursed Pants."
Hey, guys.
So, I'm starting worry<br/>about these pants.
Starting to?
No, ever since I got them,<br/>terrible things
I stubbed my toe,
I missed my train...<br/>You put on the pants.
And then the lady at the thrift<br/>store said that for years,
no one so much as tried them on.<br/>Can you believe that?
Yes.
You know what this means?
These pants are cursed.
What's this in the pocket?
A clue.
Marshall had<br/>the writing translated.
It led him deep<br/>into the heart of Chinatown.
It is you.
The One has arrived.
Dry cleaning, $21.50.
I remember that suit.<br/>He looked like
a little kid's imaginary friend.
Where is he?!
Now, Uncle Marshall<br/>knew he had only one chance
- of getting out-
Bribing a cab driver.
Machine that gives money!
Now, Marshall was pretty drunk,
but he swears the ATM<br/>started to do this.
Stop<br/>hitting me. Just for that,
you're never getting home<br/>for the birth of your son.
No!!
What's up, bro?
Wait, how did you...<br/>with the security?
I'll explain.
Tell me why we shouldn't<br/>call the authorities...
- right now?<br/>- Go ahead, call 'em.
But first, can you show me<br/>the rule that says you can't
drive a motorcycle<br/>on the casino floor?
It's not in here.
And, kids, that sign<br/>is still there to this day.
When I came out,<br/>I ran into this guy.
Two seats just opened up
on his bus to New York!
Barney, you're a genius!
Plus, here's the best part.
This Quinn thing is probably<br/>done, so I'm basically single.
He said the bus is full of<br/>hot college seniors.
Okay, maybe he didn't<br/>say "college."
Or "hot."
I miss Quinn.
What is taking Marshall so long?
Salt lick?
Just finish the door story!
Oh, wow.
I don't like this.
Okay, okay, that's<br/>four minutes!
We're going to the hospital.
W-Wait, but Marshall's<br/>not here yet.
I can't go to the hospital<br/>without Marshall!
I'm on it.<br/>Lily, spread your legs.
I'm gonna see if we can<br/>see the hooves--
uh, the-the snout--<br/>uh, the head.
- Here we go.<br/>- Take me to the hospital now.
Okay. Come<br/>on, come on.
Excuse me, sir.
My wife is in labor,<br/>and I really need to
get to Saint Marcus Hospital.
So where exactly in New York<br/>does this bus drop off?
Buffalo.
What do you mean<br/>I can't have an epidural?
You're too far along.
Things are moving much faster<br/>than expected.
Look, if your hands<br/>are tied medically,
just leave the epidural<br/>on the table and walk away.
Don't worry.
The baby slide right out, huh?
It's like a whoosh.
Like a waterslide.
Slightly painful waterslide.
Tell me a story now!
- Uh...<br/>- Uh...
Oh! Remember the time Barney
tried to pick up girls<br/>as the Terminator?
Yes.
Come<br/>with me if you want to bang.
Another.
Oh, uh, Ted and the<br/>freakishly long arm hair!
No, I disagree,<br/>because the filling--
It depends on<br/>what you're eating, right?
If it's...
Whoa. What the...?
Whoa.
The debunking of the<br/>freakishly long arm hair.
Wait, it's-it's<br/>just a thread.
I was jealous, okay?
Barney's getting all<br/>the attention today
with this Terminator thing.
Huh. Can't believe I'm not<br/>getting laid in this thing.
Maybe I need to pick<br/>a different part of the movie.
Tell me another story!
Oh, hey, we never finished<br/>"Where does that door go""
Come on.
Let's check it out.
You know what, baby,<br/>they're gone.
It's time for us to move on.
L-Lil...
Oh, my God.
New story!
Uh, the time we tested
if banana peels are<br/>really slippery.
Yes.
Ready?
There's no way<br/>that's really slippery.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Uh, the Halloween we decided<br/>to go as The Breakfast Club,
but failed to coordinate<br/>our costumes!
- Uh...<br/>- Does...
Oh.
- Really?<br/>- I mean, you live with me, Lily.
Yeah, that was funny.
Keep going!
Oh, uh, uh...
the-the time Barney<br/>saved a woman's life.
Ready?
There's no way<br/>that's really slippery.
Uh, the time Lily<br/>went into labor!
That's now!
Sorry, I'm running<br/>out of stories.
Forget it!
They're not working anymore!
Okay, Lily, I know this<br/>isn't how you imagined it,
but I want you to know
that I am here for you<br/>and I am rock solid!
Oh, I can see its head.
Oh, thank God,<br/>Dr. Sonya!
You!
Get that thing<br/>out of my delivery room!
Weak women disgust me.
All right, Lily, legs up!
We push now, yes?!
I can't.<br/>Marshall's not here yet.
Lily!
If you don't push,<br/>I will shove that baby
up your throat<br/>and pull it out of your mouth!
Where the hell is Marshall?!
I can't do this<br/>without Marshall!
Kids, sometimes the universe<br/>sends exactly what you ask for.
Other times,<br/>it sends Lily's dad.
Oh...
Remember the time<br/>you had your tonsils out?
Yeah, yeah.
You scared the crap out of me.
Yes, I did, didn't I?
Oh, my.
But do you remember<br/>what happened next?
And don't worry, Princess,
if you permanently lose<br/>the ability to speak,
we'll give you a chalkboard.
You can hang it around your<br/>neck on a little string.
Nurse, I don't know<br/>who this strange man is.
Security!
What are you talking about?<br/>I'm your daddy.
What do you mean...
Hey, fellas, come on!
I woke up in a Dumpster<br/>of medical waste,
and I couldn't<br/>have been prouder.
Because, much like<br/>that dumpster,
you had a lot of guts.
And you've used that bravery<br/>every day of your life.
With or without Marshall.
You're having this baby.
Thanks, Dad.
That story actually helped.
Oh, good, I'm glad.
And, you know, few women have<br/>vaginal tearing severe enough
to need surgical<br/>reconstruction...
- Security!<br/>- Oh, come on.
That's not necessary.
Sweetheart, please...
Oh, fellas, come on.
Please, sir, all you have to do
is take the next exit<br/>to Manhattan.
You'll be back<br/>on the road in 20 minutes.
I already told you,
I'm not allowed to stop.
Sir, this man is<br/>having a baby tonight.
And instead of going<br/>to Saint Marcus Hospital,
we're going to Buffalo.
And I've seen women from there;<br/>The city's aptly named.
Look, I'm a screwup.
I had something special<br/>with this girl Quinn,
and I ruined it.
But this guy--<br/>he's done everything right.
He's been loving and devoted<br/>since he was 18 years old.
There are only a few truly great<br/>people on this planet,
and he is one of them.
He deserves to be<br/>at the birth of his son.
So... what do you say?
Unless there's an emergency,<br/>I'm not allowed to stop,
so sit down, watch<br/>Cocoon 2 and shut up.
I'm sorry, buddy, I tried.
And then, something<br/>wonderful happened.
I'm having a heart attack!
I'm having a heart attack!
I'm having a heart attack!
And my doctor is<br/>at Saint Marcus Hospital!
So is mine!
Mine, too.
And my son is head<br/>of Cardiology.
We know!
Push!
I wish Marshall were here!
I'm here, baby.
Marshall!
I don't know why I passed out.
I have delivered<br/>12 perfectly healthy babies,
and one of them was even human.
Well, it's different<br/>when it's someone you love.
When that head was coming<br/>out of your best friend.
Oh, stop.<br/>I'm feeling woozy again.
Don't.
Salt lick?
In return for him getting me<br/>here, I may have promised Barney
that our son's middle name<br/>will be Wait For It.
I can't wait, just--<br/>what is the name?
The name is Wait For It.
That is the coolest middle name<br/>of all time!
Look, um,
I know things have been weird<br/>between us the last few months,
but...
Marshall and Lily<br/>are having a baby.
Yeah.
And, you know,<br/>I want this baby to be born
into a world where we're okay.
So, friends?
I love you, Robin.
Kidding.
You...
- Friends.<br/>- You...
Guys, great news<br/>from down the hall.
One dollar,<br/>two bags of gummy bears!
It's like, I don't even care
what happens<br/>for the rest of the day.
I...
Hey.
Well, guys, uh...
I'm a dad.
Oh, my God!
Everybody,
this is Marvin.
We named him after my pop.
Tell them the full name.
Marvin Wait For It Eriksen.
That is the coolest<br/>middle name of all-time.
Totally.
♪ You were born into<br/>a strange world ♪
♪ Like a candle, you were meant<br/>to share the fire ♪
♪ I don't know where we come<br/>from, I don't know where we go ♪
♪ But my arms were made<br/>to hold you ♪

[<div class="full-script">Kids, this is the story
of a wedding day<br/>that went horribly wrong.
Ted, the bride wants to see you.
Uncle Barney<br/>was getting married.
How the hell did we get there?
I love the name Marvin.
Marv.
Sounds like a little<br/>middle-aged man.
Golf next weekend, Marv?
How's that tax report<br/>coming, Marv?
At your age,<br/>erectile dysfunction
is nothing to be<br/>ashamed of, Marv.
It was a beautiful moment.
But then a thought popped<br/>into my head, kids.
The same thought that will pop<br/>into your heads
the first time you see your<br/>best friend holding their baby.
Wonder how much this would hurt.
That guy's a dad.
Oh, I think he's hungry.
Oh, we'll give<br/>you some privacy.
Wow. Seeing them in there<br/>all together like that,
they're a family, you know?
That's what I want.
Oh, Ted, I'm glad<br/>we're friends again.
Me, too.
Because as your friend,<br/>I have to tell you:
You're full of crap!
You say you want a family,
you say<br/>you want to meet "The One,"
but you are always chasing<br/>the wrong women.
That is not true.
Look at the women you date,<br/>starting with me:
I told you right away<br/>I didn't want marriage or kids.
Stella had a child with another<br/>man who she still loved.
Zoey was married and trying<br/>to sabotage your career
and wore a lot of stupid hats.
Hats were in that year, kind of.
Name one exception.
Victoria.
Victoria was great.
Exactly,<br/>and you threw it all away
to chase after some hot piece<br/>of ass.
- You mean you?<br/>- Thank you!
Victoria is the only<br/>woman you've dated
who could've been "The One."
You should call her.
Tiny thing, last time I saw her,<br/>she was getting engaged.
That was eight months ago.
For all you know,<br/>she's single again.
What if she's married?
What if she's not?
Then you would actually<br/>have a chance
to get what you say you want,<br/>and it terrifies you.
Whoa.
What's wrong?
I ruined things with Quinn.
I insisted she stop stripping,
we got in a huge fight about it,
then I ran off to Atlantic City<br/>for two days without calling.
What the hell<br/>am I coming home to?
Let's have an eight-way with<br/>my six hottest stripper friends.
Um, how is that a punishment?
Wait for it.
But I forbid you from filming it
with your overhead camera
that zooms in<br/>on whoever's being the loudest.
Nooooo!
No, that's too cruel.
Or, you know,<br/>maybe Quinn's moved out.
I didn't even think of that!
Hi.
Welcome home.
I decided the place was a bit<br/>too "American Psycho" for me,
so while you were gone,<br/>I hired a decorator
and I asked him,
"What would the inside
of Tinkerbell's vagina<br/>look like?"
And the kid just ran with it!
So... what do you think?
Thank God you're still here!
Welcome home.
Lily and Marshall asked Robin<br/>to be the photographer
for Baby Marvin's<br/>Birth Announcement card
instead of me.
Whatever.
The only problem?
Okay. How about this?
Tomorrow, we go<br/>to Central Park at sunset
and we get the perfect picture<br/>in the perfect setting.
Oh, I like that.
It'll be Marvin's first<br/>outing into the world.
You're gonna love<br/>the park, buddy.
It's a great place<br/>to meet chicks.
Or-or dudes.
Or both.
Oh, we love you no matter what!
And kids, as I watched your<br/>Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,
another thought<br/>popped into my head.
Even though you<br/>didn't buy anything,
I want to thank you<br/>for coming in.
Here's a free teddy bear.
What are you gonna<br/>name the little guy?
Six Pack.
Gun it, bitches!
That girl's a mom!
Okay, so I met this girl<br/>on the train,
and I texted her, "What's up"
She texted,<br/>"Hey," exclamation point.
Does that mean,<br/>"Ask me out" or "Just..."
Ted, we are responsible for<br/>a whole other human life now,
so new rule: You can't come<br/>to us with any issue unless
it's an "8" or higher.
Got it.
So I'm thinking of texting<br/>back a winky smiley face.
Eight or higher, bro.
Well, no, what should I--
Eight or higher, bro.
No, yeah,<br/>I'm just wondering if--
Eight or higher, bro.
Well, where do you rate this?
This is the same as what's in<br/>little Marvin's pants right now:
A soft two.
Sorry, bro.
Stop texting the bimbo<br/>and call Victoria.
That chapter's over.
W-We just weren't destined<br/>to be together.
"Destined." Aren't you tired<br/>of waiting for destiny, Ted?
Isn't it time<br/>to make your own destiny?
Hey, false alarm.
What I was smelling was<br/>the previous poop,
which, apparently, is<br/>still somewhere on my
clothes and/or in my hair.
- Hold him, would you?<br/>- Oh.
- Ooh.<br/>- Yeah, smart.
Oh, sure, that one<br/>turns out great. Ugh.
- And then another thought popped-
That guy's nowhere<br/>near being a dad.
Hello?
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.
Um, listen, I was just wondering
if you wanted to catch up<br/>sometime; it's been a while.
That sounds nice.
I'm actually around<br/>this afternoon.
Oh, wow, uh, great.
MacLaren's at 2:00?
Is 1:30 okay?
I might have a thing later.
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.
See you then.
Meanwhile, Barney<br/>and Quinn were off to Hawaii
for their first getaway<br/>as a couple.
Ma'am, I need you<br/>to open your suitcase.
It's mine.
Did you have<br/>to replace my luggage, too?
Run away on me again, you'll<br/>be wearing hot pink stilettos.
What's that?
Yeah, what is that?
It's a magic trick.
You see, I'm something<br/>of a magician.
Open the box, sir.
Oh, I can't do that.
Sir, are there drugs<br/>in that box?
Oh, no. He's probably<br/>just barking
because of the explosives.
Oh, my God!
Tell us what's<br/>in the box right now!
I can't.
Magician's Code.
Okay, I need to figure out<br/>if Victoria ever got engaged.
I'll have to very subtly<br/>check for an engagement ring.
Hmm, can't see the left hand.
Open the box now!
I can't.
Magician's Code.
What the hell is<br/>the Magician's Code?!
"A magician never<br/>reveals his tricks."
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor
from the hallowed<br/>Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,
taught me the importance<br/>of the Code
one fateful autumn<br/>night in 1993.
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.
Wh-What are you doing here?
Um...<br/>I'm checking up on you.
Just to make sure<br/>you're practicing your craft
or whatever.
That is an honor, sir.
And yeah, I promise,<br/>I'm practicing.
But wait.
Why were you, why were you<br/>going in my mom's room?
Uh... your mom's actually<br/>helping me with a new trick.
That is so cool!
What is this trick?
Is it sawing a lady in half?
Well, not sawing.
But actually,
the Magician's Code forbids me
from telling you anything else<br/>about the trick.
Wayne, come back to bed!
Okay, it involves a bed.
W-W-Wait. Can<br/>you at least
tell me the name of this trick?
Sure, kid.
It's called--
The Disappearing Salami.
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him
before he could ever tell me<br/>what the trick was.
Yeah, that guy was<br/>banging your mom.
Yup.
Totally.
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--
Oh, my God, he was.
Wait, why are you bringing<br/>a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?
I was hoping to shoot up<br/>to Honolulu
for the Worldwide<br/>Magic Convention.
Don't worry. You'll<br/>notice I was gone.
It's only three<br/>14-hour days.
So on our romantic getaway
to help me forget about<br/>you skipping town on me,
you're skipping town on me?!
Look Quinn, you're<br/>very important to me,
but you're sharing my heart<br/>with an equally important Miss.
Miss...
Direction.
What?
H...
Shoot him.
So what did you order?
Oh, just black coffee.
I like it that way, too.
Yeah, it just tastes<br/>better to me.
I find that if the coffee beans<br/>are good enough,
you really don't need--<br/>Why are you in a wedding dress?!
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...
get married today.
All your friends and family<br/>are waiting for you
in some church right now?
Well, not all; we had<br/>five last-minute no-shows.
Well... six.
Mazel tov, Ted.
I was starting to think<br/>this would never happen.
Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--
I told you he wasn't gay.
Wait, what?
I was tempted to leave Klaus<br/>for you last fall.
The only thing holding me back<br/>was the Robin of it all.
I know, and you were right,<br/>but... but that's all over now.
She moved out-- I mean, we're<br/>still friends, but that's over.
All these years, I never stopped<br/>thinking about you, Ted.
I've got a car outside
if you're ready to drive off<br/>into the sunset together.
But if you don't feel<br/>the same way,
if you've closed the door on us,
just say the word...
and I'll go.
Barney, tell them the trick.
The only person I could possibly<br/>reveal the trick to
is another magician.
Well, I'm a magician.
Prove it.
Whoo-hoo!
That's Barney's version.
Quinn said it was<br/>a simple card trick.
Who's to say which<br/>version was true?
Quinn's.<br/>Quinn's version was true.
Okay.
I'll tell you.
Oh, that's really cool.
So what's the trick?
I can't say.<br/>Magician's Code.
Ta-da...
da-da-da-da-da-da.
Hello.
Why did you make me<br/>call Victoria?
She's here in a wedding dress.
I'm the verge of<br/>ruining a wedding!
And Mrs. Madsen's friend<br/>thinks I'm gay,
but let's put a pin<br/>in that till later.
Oh, my God.<br/>Victoria's at the bar with Ted.
That's a seven.
And she's in a wedding dress.
That's a ten.
We got a ten!
What are you gonna do?<br/>Where is she right now?
So this dress, what's the cut?
Are we talking princess,<br/>ball gown, column?
Right, 'cause it's a federal<br/>crime to love weddings.
She's in the bathroom,<br/>which I guess
takes forever with that<br/>giant poufy skirt thing.
Ball gown. Thank you.
Four shots of tequila.
Ted, calm down.
Or not. This is your chance<br/>to get the one who got away.
You want her, she wants you,
what's the problem?
The problem is Victoria's in<br/>the middle of a giant freak-out.
What if she winds up<br/>regretting this decision?
She's going after Ted Mosby.
That's the best decision<br/>she's ever made.
There you go.
- Whoa. What was that?<br/>- What?
You said you wanted a picture<br/>of Baby Marvin's first outing.
Our baby's first outing
was to a bar.
I dribble Cuervo<br/>on Marv's soft spot.
Here she comes! Quick!
Oh, yeah.
Eggshell or cream?
Is it eggshell or cream?
So.
You... me...<br/>riding off into the sunset.
Any thoughts?
One question:
FDR or Westside Highway,
what's the quickest<br/>way to the sunset?
I need to ask you both<br/>a few questions.
Let's start with you.
Name?
Quinn Garvey.
Occupation?
Unemployed.
Well, well, well.
Look who's keeping secrets now.
Sir, I'll tell you her<br/>stripper.
She insists she's proud of it,
but apparently not<br/>proud enough to tell you.
Barney, I was going to surprise<br/>you with this on our trip,
but... I quit.
You... did that for me?
Yes.
And now that you know<br/>what I did for you,
and how much I care for you,
would you please<br/>show him the trick?
Sorry. Magician's Code.
Where should we go?
Your place?
My place?
We could go on my honeymoon.
Just kidding.
Although, it is paid for.
- I know where we should go.<br/>- Where?
Your wedding.
I'm taking you back.
I don't understand.
I thought you wanted this.
I do want this.
I've thought about you<br/>so many times.
What might have been...
But I got left at the altar,<br/>and it nearly killed me.
You're someone's fiancé,
and I have to respect that.
So let's hit a motel,<br/>jam in a quickie,
and get you back<br/>to your wedding.
It's the right thing to do.
Some part of me<br/>needed to hear you say
that running away together<br/>wasn't an option.
And now that I know that...
it's like I'm sobering up.
Is there any way
that we can just pretend<br/>this never happened?
This never happened.
Mr. Flanagan wasn't<br/>banging my mom.
Well.
Your flight left.
We need to hold Mr. Stinson<br/>for further questioning.
But you're free to go.
Maybe I should.
Wait!
I'll show you the trick.
Sir!
May I please have<br/>the silk handkerchief
in your top left breast pocket?
Well... I don't have...
Sim salabi ma...<br/>sim salabi ma...
Relax, relax,<br/>it's part of the trick.
How did you get that<br/>through the X-Ray machine?
No questions from<br/>the audience, please!
What is that?
Madam, may I please have
the key on your necklace?
Oh!
Is that gonna explode?
What?
Ahem.
What?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Come on, guys.
We're losing the light<br/>for Baby's Second First Outing.
I hate to say it,<br/>but Robin nailed it.
- Hey.<br/>- Guys, we've got something to tell you.
Eight or higher, bro.
We're engaged.
That's a... that's a ten.
We got another ten!
- Oh...<br/>- Wow, big day!
- Congratulations!<br/>- Thank you.
How did this happen?
Oh... magic.
Oh.
Uh, not to ruin the moment,
but apparently little Marvin<br/>is quite stunned by the news.
Well...
- Yeah. Wow.<br/>- Yeah.
Do you guys mind<br/>recounting this romantic tale
next to a Diaper Genie?
Oh, Marvin, you're about to<br/>hear your first love story!
Once up on a time,
this creepy magic dude<br/>was boning Barney's mom...
It's our last chance<br/>to run away together.
Door's right there.
Yes, we'll start a new life.
- Head for the border!<br/>- Canada!
Eh, Mexico.<br/>Canada sucks.
Okay, well,<br/>you're one-quarter Canadian,
so by that logic<br/>you one-quarter suck.
I'm 100% awesome
and you know it.
Yeah, I do.
Look, I-I hope this isn't weird,<br/>or anything, because...
Barney...
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

You look like you're coming from a wedding.
- Was it a nice one?<br/>- Uh, it's a long story.
And I don't mean to be rude, but I really<br/>don't feel like talking about it.
It all started when<br/>the bride asked to see me.
Wow.
Okay, don't sugarcoat it, Mosby.
Just give it to me straight, okay?
How bad is Barney freaking out right now?
Oh, he's fine.
Oh, I'm serious. He's totally fine.
I have a better tie at home.
It's cornflower blue. It's cornflower blue!
You may rest assured, Barney Stinson...
is absolutely,<br/>100% going through with this wedding.
Okay.
Good news.
Um, just one small issue.
Uh, I can't go through with this wedding.
Okay, calm down.
Everyone feels this way<br/>on their wedding day.
- It'll pass.<br/>- No. It's more than that.
I am having a serious crisis.
I wonder if it would be hard<br/>to climb out that window.
Climbing out's easy.
Climbing in's the real challenge.
Oh, right.
- It's the same window, isn't it?<br/>- Yeah.
That story transpired in May of 2012.
As you may recall...
Lily and Marshall were gloriously happy...
having just welcomed your cousin, Marvin.
While Barney and Quinn were gloriously<br/>happy, having just gotten engaged.
A nd Robin? Well-
Oh! Got it.
Man, that sumbitch had been<br/>in there since breakfast!
Robin-1. Poppy seed-zero.
Heck, this calls for some champagne.
I think there's some in the fridge.
We'll get it. We're totally not<br/>gonna have sex in the kitchen...
- if that's what you're thinking.<br/>- Aw, we're not?
No, no, we are.<br/>I already took off your bra.
Oh!
Hey, are you guys sure<br/>you can handle champagne?
You haven't slept in, like, a week.<br/>We should just call it a night.
Oh, I see what this is about.
You feel weird because Barney's engaged.
What? No, of course not.
And I will tell you why it's not weird.
- What's not weird?<br/>- The fact that Barney's engaged.
- Barney's engaged?<br/>- Heck, this calls for some champagne.
I think there's some in the fridge.
Oh, my God.<br/>Why don't you both just admit it?
You're deliriously exhausted.
- We're fine.<br/>- Really?
We're not gonna be the kind of people...
who have a baby and become total zombies.
Yes, Robin.<br/>We're not gonna be the kind of people...
who have a zombie and become total babies.
Okay, well, what I was saying is-
Do you understand?
- Yes! God, yes.<br/>- You are preaching to the choir, sister.
- Whew!<br/>- Hey.
So, I am thinking about my bridal party.
And, uh, I don't have a lot of girlfriends.
- Mmm.<br/>- I have work friends...
but I worked at a strip club, and I know...
they'll just complain about<br/>any bridesmaid's dress that has a front.
So, would you guys be my bridesmaids?
- I'd be honored. - Yes.<br/>- Of course.
Not you, Marshall.
- But, yay. Thank you.<br/>- Oh.
- Great. Oh, thank you.<br/>- Oh, my gosh.
It's gonna be so much fun.
Yeah, now it's weird.
What's weird?
Me being Quinn's bridesmaid.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, sweetie.<br/>She probably won't even ask you.
She just did. And we both said yes.
Heck, this calls for some champagne.
I think there's some in the fridge.
Mean while, I was also gloriously happy...
driving off into the sunset<br/>with Victoria...
who left her fiancé, Klaus,<br/>at the altar for me.
There was just one problem.
I wonder if Klaus found your note yet.
- My note?<br/>- Yeah.
You know,<br/>the "I'm leaving you at the altar" note.
Is that a thing?
When you leave someone at the altar,<br/>you always leave a note.
It's common courtesy.
I think common courtesy<br/>went out the window when I did.
Look, when Stella left me at the altar,<br/>at least I got an explanation.
I mean, that note is what keeps you sane.
You read it. You reread it.
You memorize it. You sleep with it.
You sniff it because it still<br/>kind of smells like her.
And then finally, you let it go-
tied to a brick right through<br/>her perfect little suburban bay window.
- I'll just text him.<br/>- You're leaving a note.
So Barney and I have already disagreed<br/>on a few of the wedding details.
I wanna go with a buffet...
and he wants to ride down<br/>the aisle on a grizzly bear.
He'll be wearing a tux.
Fine. Fine. I'll settle for a panda bear.
But you have to call my tailor.<br/>He'll be furious about this switch.
Hey, Barney, uh, we've gotta talk.
Um, Quinn just asked me to be one<br/>of her bridesmaids.
Isn't she even a little weirded out<br/>that you and I used to date?
Quinn doesn't have<br/>a jealous bone in her body.
She rolls with the punches.
- She-<br/>- Doesn't have a clue.
No, she does not.
Okay.
Okay.
"Klaus, there is no easy way to tell you<br/>why I won't be marrying you today.
Have a great summer. Victoria."
That's it?
No. No, we gotta do this right.
Well, you can't write it.
One look, it's gonna be obvious<br/>it's a guy's handwri-
Oh, no. We're good.
Okay, fine. You write. I'll advise.
Klaus-
Just "Klaus"?
Come on, give it some heart. The poor guy.
Dear, sweet Klaus-
"Sweet"? Are you still<br/>in love with this jerk?
I'm doing this on my own.
I'm sorry. I just-
You know, I feel bad for the guy.
I'm stealing the greatest girl<br/>in the world away from him.
You're not stealing me.
I'm choosing you.
Because you are loving...
and you are caring...
and you are going to go deliver this note.
Wait. You want me to go in there?
It took everything I had to climb out<br/>that church window today, and...
if I have to go back in there...
I'm not sure I can do it again.
It has to smell like you.
So Quinn has no idea that we used to date?
None whatsoever.
Okay, Barney, think this through.
Do you really want to spend<br/>the rest of your life with Quinn-
- Oh, God, you have a point.<br/>- Haven't gotten to it yet.
Of course. Continue.
Do you really want to spend<br/>the rest of your life with Quinn...
and keep this secret?
I mean, she's gonna find out.
Quinn's never gonna find out, because I've<br/>destroyed every piece of evidence...
that you and I were ever a couple.
That's ridiculous.
You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.
You replaced me with a tiger.
I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<br/>Had to get creative.
Well, I'm glad...
that deleting our entire time together<br/>was so easy for you...
but I guarantee you,<br/>Quinn is gonna find out eventually.
No, she won't.<br/>I just need your help. Yours too.
I know you guys are out of it, but you have<br/>to promise not to tell Quinn, okay?
Tell Quinn what?
- Exactly.<br/>- No, she's really asking.
Tell Quinn what?
Ooh.
- Can't climb the drainpipe.<br/>- What?
When I was in fourth grade,<br/>I couldn't climb the rope in gym class...
and all the other kids made fun of me<br/>even though it wasn't my fault.
I had to go after Efthimios Papajapoulos.
The rope was slick with lamb grease!
Okay, so just walk in the front door<br/>and act like you belong.
Here. Here's the key to the dressing room.
- Can I help you?<br/>- Hi.
I'm the church handyman.
I'm here to fix the... broken thing.<br/>It's busted.
The bride is taking a schnooze.
She asked me to stand watch<br/>so that no one disturbs her.
- I'll be quick.<br/>- You will be dead.
I used to wrestle in Leipzig.
You know what? A note's redundant.
You're not there. He gets it.
No, you were right. I have to leave a note.<br/>It's common courtesy.
Well, it's not gonna be possible with<br/>Andrea the Giant standing guard up there.
Oh, right. Klaus's sister.
It's too bad Barney's not here.
Man, he lives for bridesmaids.
Right, but he's not.
And it's not like<br/>he could seduce Uta over the phone.
Challenge accepted!
- Honey, it's not cheating if it's on the phone, right?<br/>- Say what now?
Quinn's on board! Text me her number.
You filthy, disgusting man!
But, yes, I will do that to myself<br/>at your instruction.
Let me find a broom closet.
Oh, ja. Gut.
I did it. I did it!
You're amazing. Let's get out of here.
I left the car keys in the dressing room.
I'm pretty sure the door locked behind me.
Oh, God.
I found it kind of insulting that Barney<br/>doesn't think we can keep this secret.
I mean, yeah, Marvin's<br/>keeping us up all night...
but he's still the prettiest<br/>little girl in the city.
Baby, did you just hear yourself?
You said,<br/>"Prettiest little girl in the city."
- I think you meant "country."<br/>- Yeah.
Hey, what does Barney think?
We're just gonna blurt out<br/>that he used to date-
Shh!
Oh! That was close.
Quinn could've heard us through the-
Good catch.
I almost just blurted out<br/>that Barney used to date Robin.
Barney used to date Robin?
Oh.
When did you get in here?
Like, 10 minutes ago when you said...
"Hey, Quinn,<br/>let's all go hang out in Marvin's room."
Auf Wiedersehen, Fräulein.
You know, I hate<br/>to perpetuate the stereotype...
but German female wrestlers from Saxony...
are just begging for it.
You dated Robin?
Verdammt!
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I'll tell you everything, the whole story.
Fine. You have one minute<br/>before I walk out that door.
Um, it's, uh, kind of a long story, Quinn.
Gonna take a little bit<br/>longer than a minute.
Fifty-two seconds.
Seven years ago, when Marshall<br/>and Lily got engaged...
Ted saw Robin across<br/>a crowded room, and I said...
"Oh, yeah, you just know<br/>she likes it dirty."
But Ted really liked her,<br/>so we played "Have you met Ted?"
They went to dinner. He walked her home.
Should have kissed her, didn't. Lame.
So he stole a Smurf penis.<br/>Went to her place.
Should've kissed her, didn't.<br/>Lame. He threw three parties.
They kissed on the roof,<br/>but decided to be friends. Lame.
Then Ted wanted to take Robin to a wedding.
She couldn't go.<br/>He went alone and met Victoria.
Didn't kiss her either. Lame.<br/>Not a great closer, Ted.
But he finally kissed her.
They started dating. She went to Germany.
Ted kissed Robin. Lost Victoria.<br/>Ted did a rain dance.
Got Robin. Ted and Robin broke up.
Robin moved to Brazil.<br/>Came back with a Latin stud.
Ted got jealous. Got a tramp stamp.
Not relevant to the story.<br/>I just like mentioning that.
I hooked up with Robin.<br/>Ted and I stopped being friends.
Ted got hit by a bus. We made up.
Robin and I started dating.
I got fat. Her hair fell out.
We broke up. Robin dated Don. I dated Nora.
Cheated on her with Robin. I dumped Nora.
Robin dated Kevin, but not for long.
Then I met you.<br/>You took my grandpa's watch.
I fell in love with you anyway.<br/>You let me fart in front of you.
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.
We came over here to meet little Marvin.<br/>And that's everything!
Also, I went on The Price Is Right<br/>and won a dune buggy.
Good-bye, Barney.
Good-I ju-
She lets you fart in front of her?
Barney, you go get that girl.
Oh, God!
You cannot tell anyone that you saw me.
- I cannot get married today!<br/>- Klaus?
Oh, I'm a mess.
I threw up in the cloakroom.<br/>I blamed a small child.
I cannot get married. I left a note.
Good for you. Not everyone thinks of that.
Who doesn't leave a note?<br/>It's common courtesy.
Thank you!
- Do you have the time?<br/>- Um, yeah. It's 20 after 7:00.
Ah, sehr gut.<br/>I can still make the 8:05 back to the city.
Auf Wiedersehen.
And suddenly it hit me
a way to absolve Victoria of any blame.
All I had to do was climb that drainpipe.
What? No, Klaus, no.
Mach schnell, sleepyhead. It's time to-
I know about you and Barney.
Who told her?
You guys did.
God. Go to sleep.
Okay, no one is going anywhere<br/>until we find out who told you.
Look, there is nothing going on<br/>between me and Robin.
And why should I believe that?
Well, for starters, I have a boyfriend.
No, Robin, you don't have to do this.
There have been enough lies.
I'm not lying.
His name is Nick.
I didn't want to jinx it<br/>by telling everyone.
So I just told Marshall and Lily.<br/>You tell 'em, guys.
We were just talking<br/>about this earlier today.
Okay, well, what I was saying is-
I have no desire to get Barney back<br/>because I'm with Nick now...
and, well, I don't want to be crude...
but I want to spend all day<br/>licking his abs.
Do you understand?
- Mm-hmm.<br/>- Yes! God, yes.
You are preaching to the choir, sister.
I stand by it.
Guys, it's okay.
You're new parents.<br/>You just need to get some sleep.
We're fine.
This is hard, guys!
- It's really hard!<br/>- Aw, honey.
Oh, God! Stay with me. Stay with me.
Go get your baby.
Look, it doesn't matter<br/>that you have a boyfriend.
I'm always gonna be wondering if you<br/>secretly still have feelings for Barney.
I don't care who this guy is.
Okay, we're good.
Okay, well, I'm glad<br/>I left work early for this.
Robin, maybe later we can discuss<br/>the meaning of the word "emergency"...
and the phrase "trapped under a car."
- Okay.<br/>- Okay.
You know he has chicken legs.
Little tiny chicken legs.
You guys saw those, right?
It's not cheating<br/>if I lie down on the bar...
and let Nick do a shot<br/>from my belly button, right?
- Say what now?<br/>- Barney's on board!
Nick, hold on!
Thanks for your help today.
Yeah, sure.
Although, it, uh, kind of sucked...
seeing how easy it was for you to throw<br/>away everything from our relationship.
I-I could never do that.
622 West 14th Street.
A nd so, Victoria and I<br/>were back where we started.
But there was something<br/>I couldn't get off my mind.
I'll be right back.
Uh, excuse me.
Oh, hey. it's you.
Ja, okay. I'm not sure what kind of vibe<br/>I was giving off before...
but I am not interested<br/>in your schnitzel, okay?
No, no, no, no, no. God, no.
I just have one quick question.
Victoria seems like a great girl.
Why wouldn't you want to marry her?
Ach, okay. Victoria ist wunderbar.
Oh, I'm sorry. "Wunderbar" is the German<br/>word for "wonderful."
- Yeah, I know.<br/>- Oh, you speak German?
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no. Just-Just the one word.
Oh. Oh.
Ah, okay.
Victoria.
There is a word in German.
I ebenslangerschicksalsschatz.
And the closest translation would be...
"lifelong treasure of destiny."
And Victoria ist wunderbar...
but she is not my<br/>I ebenslangerschicksalsschatz.
She is my Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand.
You know?
You know wunderbar but you don't know<br/>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?
That is something we learn in kindergarten.
I'm sorry.<br/>"Kindergarten" is the German word for-
No, no, I know that one.
Oh, okay. But you don't know<br/>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand.
You are maddeningly inconsistent.
It means "the thing<br/>that is almost the thing that you want...
but is not quite."
Das ist Victoria to me.
How do you know she's not<br/>I ebenslangerschicksalsschatz?
I mean, maybe as the years go by,<br/>she'll get...
I ebenslangerschicksalsschatz-ier.
Oh, nein.
I ebenslangerschicksalsschatz<br/>is not something that develops over time.
It is something that happens instantaneously.
It courses through you<br/>like the water of a river after a storm...
filling you and emptying you all at once.
You feel it throughout your body...

[<div class="full-script">Kids, the summer of 2012<br/>was the Summer of Love.
Barney and Quinn,
me and Victoria,
Robin and Nick,
Lily, Marshall and Marvin.
Everyone was happy as can be.
Which means there are<br/>absolutely no good stories.
Let's skip ahead...
to October 2012,
the official kick-off
of what came to be known as
the Autumn of Breakups.
It all started when Barney<br/>got a little friendly advice
from a coworker.
Get a prenup,<br/>or I'll neuter you
before she ever has a chance!
First of all,<br/>if you have an onion bagel,
you don't need<br/>scallion cream cheese.
Secondly, Quinn<br/>is a great girl.
I trust her.
Oh, Darlene was a great girl.
I trusted her.
And then she took everything!
My house, my car...
my dog Tugboat.
I even lost out with the kids.
Full custody!
I got full custody<br/>of those kids!
Your kids are horrible.
The worst.
Barney, I watched as Darlene cut<br/>everything good out of my life
like a deranged surgeon<br/>hacking out organs,
and that's not a metaphor.
She got one of my kidneys.
That's her ringtone.
I have nothing left<br/>to give you, Darlene!

You won't believe<br/>what Barney did today.
You won't believe<br/>what Quinn did today.
Hey, you ready for lunch?
Hey, there she is.
The future<br/>Mrs. Barney Stinson.
You better enjoy signing<br/>your name "Quinn Garvey"
while you still can, right?
Like, I don't know...
here, here, here,<br/>initial here...
What is this?
Oh, this is our prenup.
Black or blue?<br/>Totally up to you.
Um, can I read it first?
Can you believe that?
He wants me to sign a prenup!
Can you believe that?
She wants to read it first!
Just go ahead and sign.
It's all pretty standard.
"In the event of divorce,
"Mr. Stinson is granted<br/>weekly visitation rights
to Ann, Sarah and Molly."
You named our future kids?
That's actually pretty sweet.
Those are Mr. Stinson's names<br/>for your lady parts.
It's important for the girls
to maintain a relationship<br/>with their daddy.
You named her lady parts?
Everyone does that.
So... Lily?
Snap, Crackle, Pop.
Solid.<br/>Wait.
Is this prenup<br/>in any way legit?
I mean, so far,<br/>it sounds a lot like
that bar napkin document you<br/>make one-night stands sign,
promising not to get clingy.
The Pre-Shtup, patent pending.
God, I come up with<br/>a lot of good stuff!
Anyway, I realize
these aren't just terms<br/>for divorce, so I ask...
Are these rules for how I have<br/>to behave in our marriage?
Rules?
Suggestions.
Rich people and celebrities<br/>put stuff like this
in their prenups all the time.
And those are<br/>the marriages that last.
I have to pay $2,000<br/>every time I gain a pound?
Not every time.
Just if it shows up<br/>at the weekly weigh-in.
See, you can't do that.
"Miss Garvey must invent 12 new<br/>sexual positions per year,
"at least ten of which
involve her doing all<br/>or most of the work."
- You definitely can't do that.<br/>- Hm-mm.
"Miss Garvey's breasts must be<br/>enhanced every five years
or 50,000 honka-honkas,<br/>whichever comes first."
- That's actually not bad.<br/>- I'll allow it.
That's repulsive.
Why do men think
women like to be<br/>honka-honka'd?
What woman wants her breasts<br/>squeezed like a seal horn?
Um... totally.
Lily like-a-like-a<br/>the honka-honka.
"All hair below the neck<br/>must be removed weekly."
Hey, you're gonna be thanking me<br/>for that hair loss
during the weigh-in.
"Miss Garvey's parents<br/>may stay at our place
as long as they like."
Well, at least that one's nice.
"Provided they<br/>each arrive in an urn."
"Wives two through eight will<br/>make a weekly chore wheel."
I'm sorry, I borrowed<br/>a few sections
from a prenup I did<br/>for a Saudi Arabian sultan.
I'll cross out<br/>the extra wives stuff.
Unless...
Cross it out.
My God! What the hell<br/>does Barney think
marriage is going<br/>to be like, anyway?
Just a healthy,<br/>modern-day marriage,
based on mutual respect<br/>between two equals.
Ready for your wake-up<br/>lap dance, Master?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, my God, it's 9:00 a.m.
Legally mandated morning<br/>pillow fight time!
Best husband ever.
Best husband ever.
Best husband ever. Aw.
Best husband e...
Sorry, sorry, we crossed<br/>out the wives
two through eight stuff. Unless...<br/>- Nope.
- Okay.<br/>- Don't worry. I crossed it out.
I didn't really cross it out.
I can hear you.
I'll cross it out.
I didn't really cross it out.
Hey, hey...
Hey, guys, what's up?
Oh, Quinn's pissed because<br/>Barney wants her
to sign a crazy prenup.
But is it really crazy?
Yes. Well, I'm new to this<br/>but guessing yes.
Okay, look.
Did I go...
a speck of sand,<br/>a fairy eyelash,
a unicorn whisper too far?
Perhaps.
But can you tell me<br/>there's nothing
in any of your relationships<br/>you'd want to change?
No behavior you'd<br/>want to outlaw?
No terms you'd<br/>want to renegotiate?
Look me in the eye<br/>and tell me I'm crazy.
You're crazy.
But a funny thing<br/>happened that night.
Look, I'm not saying<br/>he's right, but
Barney does have<br/>a little bit of a point.
But on this one, he may have<br/>a point. I mean, look...
the idea of renegotiating<br/>the terms of the relationship,
that's valid.
No.
There isn't anything about you
that I'd want to change.
Well, okay,<br/>maybe a couple of things.
Like what?
And just like that...
one of these four couples<br/>would break up
the very next day.
Okay, it wasn't Lily<br/>and Marshall.
One of these three couples<br/>would break up
the very next day.
- What happened?<br/>- So last night
Nick was all like,<br/>"Barney has a point
"about renegotiating the terms<br/>of the blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah."<br/>- Yeah, and Marshall
was all like, "Uh, I want<br/>to blah, of the blah,
uh, blah, blah, blah,<br/>blah, blah."
If I shut my eyes<br/>it's like they're here.
They're just using<br/>Barney's prenup
as a way to complain about us.
I'm just saying, you've<br/>forbidden certain things
that I might like to revisit.
Marshall, you're not going<br/>on a Sasquatch hunt
in Oregon<br/>with a bunch of loonies.
Loonies?
Those brave, bearded men and<br/>women are crypto-zoologists,
and they deserve the respect<br/>that title commands.
But that's not what<br/>I was thinking of.
You're too precious<br/>with the baby.
Okay,
when we first came home<br/>with Marvin,
there was a bad moment.
Welcome home, buddy.
Was it really that high?
I don't know. I was hormonal.
And suddenly, this primal,<br/>protective mother voice
came out of me.
Actually, it was two voices.
I seriously think one<br/>was coming from my vagina.
Never do that again!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/>What is the big deal?
My brothers and my dad<br/>used to roughhouse with me
all the time.
Welcome home, Marshall.
Hi. Boys...
go long.
Stop!<br/>Not in the house.
That's how lamps break.
Now go pass<br/>that baby around outside.
Oh, fumble!
And I turned out<br/>perfectly fine.
Marshall, this morning<br/>you thought a ghost
made your toast.
I didn't put the bread in.
You didn't put the bread in.
You know what?<br/>I will play with my son
however I see fit.<br/>And you know what else?
You can honka-honka<br/>yourself tonight.
Barney's prenup
ruined my night, too.
Okay, uh, what behavior
of mine don't you like?
I'm talking about the TV thing.
Okay, the TV thing<br/>is an argument
from, like, three weeks ago.
Mmm.
Uh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't realize it<br/>takes 42 inches
to keep you satisfied.
The TV happened to be on.
I happened to glance at it.
- Does that make me so weird?<br/>- No.
- Not at all.<br/>- Thank you.
I may be a little weird.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
I get...
turned on watching myself
do the news during sex.
Yeah, that's a little weird.
Look, seeing myself<br/>on TV makes me feel
confident and sexy.
And that is nothing to be<br/>ashamed of, right, sisters?
- Never speak of this.<br/>- Ever.
- Yeah, of course.<br/>- Yeah.
There's more.
Wait.
So when you're doing the news<br/>live at 7:00,
you wink to future you
watching the rebroadcast<br/>at 11:00?
Maybe.
- Never speak of this.<br/>- Ever!
You won't believe
what Ted did last night.
You said you were<br/>happy to help him out.
Well, now I'm changing my mind.
Sorry to interrupt, roomie,<br/>but I am trying
to make sausage.<br/>Where do you keep
your pig intestines?
What's your ex-fiancé<br/>doing at Ted's?
Klaus came to me<br/>a few weeks ago.
Since we broke up,
he lost his job,<br/>he got evicted.
He's miserable.
I'm so sorry.
If I could just take<br/>a quick whore's bath
in your kitchen sink,<br/>then I will skedaddle.
Oh, Klaus, I wish that<br/>there was something
I could do to help.
There is,
little lady.<br/>I've got a guest room.
You'll stay here<br/>till you're back on your feet.
Are you sure?
This is your apartment.
Shh.
Think of this as our apartment.
Oh...
Hero Ted.
He loves that move.
Yeah, for about five minutes,<br/>then he gets hero's remorse.
Danke schon, roomie.
I will go get my things.
Das is super-duper-duper.
My ferrets will be so happy.
They have been living<br/>in an airport locker for weeks.
Here comes papa, children.
I'll admit,
there have been a<br/>few awkward moments.
You are going to love this.
This is the popular<br/>German situational-comedy,
Strange Compatriots.
Here we come.
Ooh. Here's the thing<br/>about this show, okay?
One of them is very neat
und the other one<br/>is very, very neat.
Oh, Fritz, kommen sie hier.
Ah, Fritz...
It's time to give Klaus<br/>"das boot."
Klaus?
Wait, can-can you hear us<br/>through the wall?
Yes, I can hear you.
I hear everything.
That's it.
Klaus, get in here!
For God's sake.
I want you out of my apartment.
You, those ferrets<br/>and all five newborns.
Six and counting.
Mama is still going.
It is like a clown car.
Suddenly, it wasn't<br/>our apartment anymore.
I had no say in the matter.
These guys are unbelievable.
You know what,<br/>I am gonna go home
and watch the news<br/>all by myself.
Wait.
I have an idea.
You know what?
I'm on board<br/>with the whole prenup thing.
That's great.
It's here to protect you,<br/>too, sweetie...
from becoming unappealing to me.
Actually, I made my own prenup
with a little help.
Ladies?
Go ahead and sign.
It's all pretty standard.
This might not be the<br/>best time to ask--
I'm sort of getting<br/>back in the game.
The redhead with the baby,
what's her situation?
"In the event of divorce,<br/>Miss Garvey shall get
full custody<br/>of Mr. Stinson's suits"?
Why?
What would you do with them?
Nothing. I'd just sit around<br/>and watch them go out of style.
That is just sick.
Keep reading.
"Mr. Stinson<br/>is allowed to attend
any function<br/>at the Playboy Mansion."
Well, at least that's nice.
"Provided he arrives in an urn."
Gentlemen, just in time.
What are you bitches doing here?
- Lily.<br/>- Oh, he's napping.
It's the only time<br/>I get to go blue.
Barney texted us that you<br/>guys were ganging up on him.
So we're just here to ensure
he doesn't sign anything<br/>he'll regret.
I'm sorry,<br/>I don't think anyone here
other than me is a lawyer.
A well-paid,<br/>successful lawyer.
I-I'm a lawyer.
Actually, we worked together<br/>for years.
Back off, stretch,<br/>I saw her first.
Hang on a second.
"A half million dollar fine
"any time Mr. Stinson can't<br/>'rise to the occasion, '
cue sad slide whistle sounds"?
Hey, what's this<br/>about a shock collar?
Ah, yes, we'll explain.
Miss Garvey has<br/>many attractive friends
who will come to visit.
May I offer you
goat cheese puff<br/>pastries I made, mistress?
As long as you can<br/>do it quietly.
Wait, I'm confused.
If it's not around my neck,<br/>then where's the shock collar?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
It's more<br/>of a shock ring, really.
Her idea.
Little missy<br/>is packing a brain, too.
Okay, you know what?
Since we're all pitching in,
may I suggest a provision?
In the event
that you have a son,<br/>Mr. Stinson is free
to play with his child<br/>however he sees fit.
How about forbidding<br/>your future husband
from spiking his child<br/>into his crib?
How about a clause protecting<br/>you from having to engage
in a three-way with her<br/>and whatever's on basic cable?
Oh, yeah?<br/>How about forbidding...
I got nothing.
How about a provision barring<br/>any nudist German ex-fiancés
from slapping his strudel up<br/>and down your sofa?
How about pretending<br/>to be a hero,
but then caving the moment<br/>a ferret bite breaks the skin?
The skin of my eyelid.
That's how they kiss.
Are you serious?
Enough! Enough!
You all have someone<br/>who loves you,
and you're screwing it up,<br/>and over what?
Who has the most power?
That's not love.
Love is trusting someone enough
to tell them<br/>what's really bothering you.
So that's what we're gonna do.
You, start.
When you got scared<br/>about Marvin,
it felt like<br/>you were saying that
I'm not as good a parent as you.
You're an amazing mom,
and I want to live up to that.
Well, I probably have<br/>trust issues
because my dad<br/>wasn't there for me.
But I know that you'll always<br/>be there to catch Marvin.
You, next.
Having Klaus back in our lives
made me scared we're never<br/>gonna escape the past.
I only wanted to help Klaus
because I feel guilty<br/>about how happy I am with you.
Next.
I find you so sexy,
it just hurt that you don't<br/>feel the same about me.
I get turned on watching myself<br/>do the news during sex.
Oh.
Well, that's cool.
Look at that,<br/>no legal documents needed.
Just honesty and vulnerability.
That's love.
You see, I once loved someone,
only I didn't say it enough.
Now I wish I could<br/>say it every day.
Hell, I don't care if it's crazy,
I-I'm doing it.
Hello, Darlene?
Put Tugboat on the line.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, it's the man.
And for a moment,
all felt right with the world.
But that very night,
the Autumn of Breakups<br/>would claim its first victims.
...wish you a very safe<br/>and pleasant evening.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Gute Nacht.
And you too, my babies.
Oh, danke for the sweet<br/>eye kisses.
Ow.
After you, sir.
Ladies first.
I insist.
I insist.
- I'm not throwing mine out first.<br/>- I'm not throwing mine out first.
You've slept<br/>with half the women in New York.
I'm the one who needs a prenup.
You duped me out of<br/>thousands of dollars.
I'm the one who needs a prenup.
I just thought<br/>of some more stuff to add.
I'm not half finished.
Let's dive in.
It should be simpler than this,<br/>shouldn't it?
Yeah.
Maybe it should be.
Barney, do you trust me?
No.
Do you trust me?
No.
If we really need something<br/>this complicated
to get married...
Yeah.
♪ I was anxious to be found ♪
♪ You can always go home ♪
♪ To the safety of your cloud. ♪
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey, there's always<br/>wives two through eight.
They sounded pretty hot<br/>in your fantasy.
All but wife seven.
She was just there<br/>'cause her dad was rich.
Actually, I'm okay.
I found out I'll never trust<br/>someone enough to get married,
and that's fine.
My single life is,<br/>and always will be,
legen... wait for it...
...dary!
My wedding<br/>is gonna be legendary.
So, prenup?
Not this time.
Oh, hey you.<br/>Ready for lunch?
Totally.
Mmm.
Thanks.
See, Tugboat?
That's love.
Yeah.
Okay, you see, Ludwig has<br/>started to polish the doorknobs,
but Wilhelm has<br/>already completed this chore.
Yeah.
Ahh...
You know,
it's big comedy,
but you also really care<br/>about these characters.
Wilhelm!

[<div class="full-script">Kids, October of 2012...
kicked off the autumn of breakups.
And Barney, having broken<br/>his engagement with Quinn...
was slowly trying to pick himself back up.
Welcome to Bangtoberfest!
Have a Bangtoberfest T-shirt.
I'm back!
Have a Bangtoberfest T-shirt.
I'm single again.
Sorry about your eye.
I'm available.
“Bangtoberfest.
This time it's really not personal.”
Barney, you just Went<br/>through some really big emotional stuff.
You need to give yourself<br/>some time to heal.
Robin, I spent seven grand on merch.<br/>This is happening.
Hey.
- Hey.<br/>- Hello, Marshall.
So Lily's dad just showed up<br/>two days ago unannounced.
Remember when I bought<br/>all those Mexican fireworks...
so I'd never have to buy<br/>Christmas presents again?
Oh, God. You blew up the house.
Wha-Blew up the house?
Oh, no. Nothing like that. No.
No, the fireworks blew up the garage.<br/>The house burned down.
Holy frijoles! Do I smell brownies?
We covered that fire on the news.
I had no idea “Naked Man<br/>Runs Back into Inferno...
to Rescue Potato Salad” was Mickey.
My hour's up. Your turn, Marshall.
Oh, no.
Baby Marvin, did you just go poo-poo?
Craziest thing.<br/>He just Went poo-poo this very second.
Hmm. Are you sure this poo-poo<br/>didn't happen on your Watch...
and you just ran out the clock<br/>until it was my problem?
Oh! Yeah, right.
What kind of mother<br/>lets her son sit in his own filth...
for an extra nine minutes and 42 seconds?
I got my eye on you, Aldrin.
It's Watering right now...
but I got my eye on you.
I can't believe I have<br/>to go back to work on Monday...
and we still haven't found a nanny.
Well, if Grandpa Mickeys there,<br/>couldn't he just-
Oh! Are you kidding? My dad was never there<br/>for me when I was a kid.
And when he was-
What's wrong, Daddy?
Oh, Daddy can't pick a horse<br/>to save his freakin' life.
All I need is just one lucky number.
Hey, whens your birthday?
Today.
Well-
We've got to find a nanny,<br/>and my dads definitely not it.
Well, um-And this doesn't<br/>solve your nanny problem...
but if you're in need of a babysitter,<br/>Nick and I could do it.
We're really clicking as a couple.
Um, if any couple is clicking these days,<br/>ifs me and Victoria.
Do you think that you and Victoria...
are clicking more than me and Nick?
Do you think that you and Nick are-
Oh, that's precious.
Kids, when you're in a new relationship...
and you're competing with your ex<br/>for who's happier, it can get ugly.
Anyway, I should get going.
I have to go get a key made for Nick-<br/>for my apartment. Ha-burn.
Maybe the locksmith who made the key<br/>I gave to Victoria will give you a deal.
Oh, wait. He won't remember me.<br/>It was three weeks ago.
- Ha-double-burn.<br/>- Nick signed for a package when I wasn't there.
- Victoria keeps tampons in my apartment.<br/>- Damn it!
The next day ..
Lily and Marshall's nanny search<br/>hit pay dirt.
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen...
I promise to create a safe,<br/>nurturing environment...
full of learning, laughter and love...
so that even when we<br/>have to eat lima beans...
or we get a boo-boo on our knee...
we know everything will be just fine.
And do you know why?
Because you're an angel sent from heaven?
I wanna bury my head<br/>in the safety of your bosom.
Because Mrs. Buckminster is here.
The search is over.
Mrs. Buckminster,<br/>we just need to know your salary.
Oh, delightful.
Well, my weekly fee is-
There, there.
I'm sure you'll find someone<br/>you like just as much.
- No, we won't.<br/>- Not like you!
Hey, Robin, can I borrow a stamp?
Oh. Wait.
This Wedding reply card already has one.
Why, you ask?
Victoria and I are R.S.V.P.'ing<br/>to a wedding in Jamaica...
six months from now.
Ha-triple-burn.
Oh. Jamaica.
Yeah.
That's an island, right?
Depends Where you're going with this.
All the way to the island of Hawaii.<br/>Why, you ask?
Well, I was invited to spend<br/>New Year's there last night...
when I met Nick's parents.
Ha-aloha-burn.
Have you, um, met Victoria's parents, Ted?
As a matter of fact, I haven't.
Because they're dead.
Are they, Ted?
Are they really dead?
No. Damn it!
Bangtoberfest is a flop.
I can't think of an innovative Way<br/>to bang chicks...
that properly honors my return to the game.
Sure, I've tried some old reliables.
Ten unpaid parking tickets.
I suppose there is one Way<br/>I could... get you off.
No.
I've used that admittedly<br/>awesome line a thousand times.
You're better than this, Barney.
Well, the evidence<br/>is pretty incriminating...
but I suppose there is one Way<br/>I could get you off.
Damn it!
Bangtoberfest is about<br/>innovation, about ideas.
Bangtoberfest used to mean something.
- You just made it up yesterday.<br/>- Enough questions.
I need time to think.
So, how's the nanny search going, Lil?
Lousy.
Mrs. Buckminster was a spoonful of sugar...
is Scary Poppins.
But Lily and Marshall needed a nanny...
so they forged ahead with their search.
So “zero experience” as a nanny?
Right. But in rehab, I was in charge<br/>of the cats, and only two died.
So I figured-
I'm available.
How do you feel about spanking?
For eight bucks an hour,<br/>you can do whatever you Want to me.
- I'm available.<br/>- Dad, we know.
I wasn't talking to you.
Finally they met Julie Jorgensen.
You're from St. Cloud, Minnesota?<br/>I'm from St. Cloud.
Really? Oh, you must know my dad.<br/>George Jorgensen?
Of course. George Jorgensen's Organs.
Last year my brother joined the business.
Really.
- Who knew that Morgan Jorgensen would go into organs?<br/>- Anyway, Julie-
Is it still called<br/>George Jorgensen's Organs...
or did they change it<br/>to George Jorgensen and Son Organs?
They changed it to George and Morgan Jorgensen's Organs.<br/>Guess whose idea that was.
Morgan's.
They just opened a new shop out of state.
- Oh, yeah? Where?<br/>- Oregon.
- What's that one called?<br/>- Piano Town.
Well, you have experience...
- and I think ifs safe to say you<br/>have my husbands approval. - Ohh.
- What's your salary?<br/>- Oh, um, ifs right there.
Julie, we would love<br/>for you to be our nanny.
Oh, thank you so much.
Um, I just have one last interview today.
But to be honest, I can't imagine liking<br/>anyone more than I like you guys.
Oh!
- Thank you. Bye.<br/>- Bye.
Yay.
Well, she was a total bitch.
That night,<br/>Lily and Marshall called Julie...
hoping she'd accept the job.
I'm so sorry. I can't.
Don't tell us you took the other job.
No, I didn't. I'm not taking any nanny job.
I don't understand.
The most amazing thing happened<br/>at my next interview after you guys.
I fell in love with a single dad<br/>who turns out to be a billionaire.
Tomorrow we're heading off<br/>to Paris in his private jet.
It's gonna be, as he would say,<br/>legend-Wait for it.
Barney!
Ixnay on the eal-ray ame-nay.
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen?
You son of a...
itch-bay!
Look, Barneys our friend<br/>for some reason...
and everything he told you was a lie.
But the good news is<br/>you're free to come work for us.
I'm sorry. I can't nanny for anyone<br/>who's friends with this monster.
Look...
I'd offer you guys coffee...
but I have another nanny interview<br/>in about 15 minutes, so-
Barney, quick question.<br/>Why are you interviewing nannies?
Glad you asked. You guys<br/>were all pressuring me...
to think of a revolutionary<br/>new Way to get chicks for Bangtoberfest.
And frankly, I was stumped, until-
is Scary Poppins.
And there it was.
The Big Bro in the sky<br/>had answered my prayers.
Almighty five. Ow.
I'd introduce you to little baby Edgar,<br/>but one, he's napping...
and two, he doesn't exist.
And these nannies are<br/>really falling for this?
Yeah. These toys don't<br/>even make sense for a baby.
You got an air rifle.
You got the exact racetrack with the double<br/>loop-de-loop I had as a kid.
Can I open it?<br/>Can I open it? Can I open it?
What about baby Edgar's mom?
Oh, that's a sad story.
And in the end...
the coroner's report confirmed<br/>What I already feared.
The female body cannot withstand...
that many consecutive orgasms.
I blame myself.
Okay, does anybody have<br/>six nine-volt batteries?
Once I got the nannies all sympathetic...
I had to check their qualifications.
I'd like to see how you handle bath time.
Follow me to the tub.
- Should I get the baby?<br/>- No.
I'm just gonna take the<br/>batteries out of these smoke detectors.
Cool? Cool.
Once the interview is over,<br/>I... Went in for the kill.
You're perfect for the job.
So congratulations. You're hi-
No. I can't do this.
I find you very attractive...
and it wouldn't be appropriate.
It wouldn't be appropriate.
It wouldn't be appropriate.
I repeat. it-It would not be appropriate.
It was like taking candy<br/>from an imaginary baby.
Barney, I just Went five months<br/>with no help...
and interviewed 92 nannies<br/>before finding one we liked.
And you ruined everything the night before<br/>I'm supposed to go back to Work?
Thank you for being<br/>the most immature person I have ever met.
Marshall, let's go.
- Five more minutes.<br/>- Now.
- I'll be right back.<br/>- Okay.
- Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm.<br/>- Mmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
- I'll miss you.<br/>- Hmm.
Aw.
Overcompensating a bit?
Why would I need to overcompensate?
I am... deliriously happy<br/>in my perfect relationship.
What about What I just witnessed<br/>not two minutes ago?
How could the Giants pass on third and one?
Honey, ifs okay.
It's the first quarter,<br/>and the Browns are only up by three.
Robin, I don't Want you to fix this.
I just Want to feel heard.
First of all, the Giants were smart<br/>not to run on my Dawg Pound defense.
- They suck, Ted.<br/>- I know.
And two, there is no way...
that you like being with a guy<br/>who's so emotional and needy.
You wanna dance, Mosby?
Let's talk about yesterday.
Hi. You guys, I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I'm gonna run upstairs, change.<br/>I'll be back in five minutes.
Take your time, sweetie.
Victoria's a slob.
Well, at least I'm not dating a girl.
- You know What I mean.<br/>- Hey, you know What?
I-I really appreciate<br/>how sensitive and in touch he is with his-
God, who am I kidding?
Twenty bucks says he is crying<br/>in the ladies' room right now.
Well, at least when he's<br/>finished, he's gonna flush.
So just as Lily<br/>was about to call in sick...
on her first day back to work-
Good morning.
Mrs. Buckminster, hold me<br/>and make everything okay.
I mean, uh, What are you doing here?
A Mr. Stimson called the agency<br/>and offered to pay my salary.
Wow. Really?
It's a nice gesture, but I'm still pissed.
He also sent along this.
- Are the batteries-<br/>- Yes, the batteries are included, dear.
Yes!
Now off to work, you two.
Mr. Marvin and I<br/>are going to get acquainted.
Great. I can't wait to hand him off...
and finally get some freedom.
You deserve it. Now hand him over.
Hand him over, yep.
I'll just take little Marvin<br/>off your hands then.
Take him off my hands. Here he goes.
Ready to receive him.
I can't give Marvin to a stranger!
Okay, somebody who is not<br/>in the middle of a race...
should probably go talk to her.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Buckminster.
We've decided we're not gonna use<br/>a nanny after all.
- You're fired.<br/>- Calm down.
Lily, you're just nervous...
about spending your first day<br/>away from Marvin...
and that's perfectly normal.
Oh, I am holding on to you forever.
And when I die and become a skeleton,<br/>I'll still be holding you.
Yes, yes.
Last night, Nick cried<br/>when I killed a spider.
You should've brought<br/>that spider over to my house...
to feast on the ant colony<br/>breeding on Victoria's unwashed dishes.
- Whoa!<br/>- Barney, What happened to you?
It was a nightmare.
I'm walking down the street,<br/>minding my own business...
and I see one of the nannies<br/>that I interviewed...
and I'm thinking maybe / can get her behind<br/>a Dumpster and interview her again.
But then-
And then-
They were everywhere.
- I was surrounded<br/>- Hi.
Did you really think you<br/>could get away with this?
As a matter of fact, I did.
Time for your nap.
I woke up in a Dumpster<br/>covered in diapers.
And I found a pacifier somewhere<br/>I'm not Willing to discuss.
What is Wrong with me?
You're still getting over Quinn.
You can't just dive right back<br/>into single-Barney mode.
But I can't stop myself.<br/>I'm out of control.
No, I'm not. I'm fine.<br/>Now, if you'll excuse me...
that blonde at the bar<br/>looks as loose as my rear molars.
Stop me. don't stop me. I'm fine. Help.
Being singles great!
You know...
Victoria's messiness just forces me<br/>to grow as a cleaner.
Totally.
And Without Nick, who's gonna hem my pants?
To making these relationships last.
Both relationships would<br/>implode within the month.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey.
- Did you guys conk out?<br/>- Yeah, I guess we did.
- What time is it?<br/>- 5:00.
Wow. We slept all day.
Quick question. Um, where's Marvin?
Right here.
Hey, gang. What's the big Whoop?
Marvin!
Dad, What happened?
Well, when / came back<br/>this morning from my jog...
Marshall was gone,<br/>and I couldn't find Mrs. What's-her-face.
And you two were sawing logs.
So I figured I'd lend a hand.
Then why did I wake up holding a monkey?
Well, a little later, I got kind of hungry.
So I gave him a bath and put<br/>his diaper rash ointment on...
and fed him strained peas, not bananas,<br/>'cause he had bananas yesterday.
Then I did the laundry,<br/>finished my burrito...
put him down for his nap at noon,<br/>sterilized the bottles...
and then we just Went to the park.
Okay.
Wow. That's incredible.
- When did you get so good with kids?<br/>- Know something, honey?
You don't remember this, but, um,<br/>for the first few years of your life...
your mom worked<br/>and I was a stay-home dad.
I thought Grandma and Grandpa<br/>took care of me.
Well, they visited a lot,<br/>but I was the guy who took care of you.
You know, America thinks I ran into<br/>that burning house to get potato salad.
But I actually ran in<br/>to get this photo album...
and potato salad.
Sure.
Dad, I never realized<br/>you were there for me.
How come there are no pictures of me<br/>after I go to preschool?
Well-
Okay. Well, have fun...
on your first day at preschool, princess.
Mwah. Okay, off you go.
There you go.
How am I gonna make it to 3:00 Without her?
Belmont Racetrack.
Hmm.
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt<br/>to go just once.
Six months later, guess What gambling<br/>addicts thumbs had metal pins in them.
This guy. Barn.
Look, honey, I was a jerk who wasn't there<br/>for most of your childhood...
and I regret that<br/>every single day of my life.
But I promise you I'm here now...
for Marvin-if you want.
You're hired.
♪ I took up to you ♪
♪ You don't look down on me ♪
♪ What do you see in me? ♪
♪ Is it oceans of blue? ♪

Ten parking tickets, huh?
I suppose there is a Way<br/>I could, uh, get you off.
Why'd I ever doubt a classic?
Now, now, now.
This is exactly the sort of behavior...
you hired me to put an end to, Mr. Stimson.
Off with you, dear.<br/>Go make better decisions.
You're right.
Thanks, Mrs. Buckminster.
You're welcome.<br/>And I'm proud of you for trying to change.
What you're doing with these young women...
is simply not appropriate.
That can never happen again.
Oh, pish posh.
You said that five times ago.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, once your<br/>Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily
found a nanny for baby Marvin,
they were excited
for their first night out<br/>together in five months.
And so were we.
Mama.
Dada.
Hi, gang.
Ooh.
Ah, so, now that there's no
screaming baby to distract us,
what have you guys been up to lately?<br/>Yeah.
This was a surprisingly<br/>loaded question.
You see, right<br/>after Marvin was born,
Lily and Marshall<br/>had issued a decree.
you can't come to us<br/>with any issue
unless it's an eight<br/>or higher.
And we were doing<br/>our best to abide.
Ted, how are things
going with Victoria?
My dad made the funniest joke.
He said that since you're<br/>the reason I left the wedding,
you owe him the $70,000<br/>he paid for it,
or else.
You know, he's not<br/>usually funny like that.
Not promising,<br/>but not an eight.
Everything's great.
And Robin, how's<br/>everything with Nick?
Finally ready<br/>for a ride on the bike?
Who? Me?
Let's ride, Big Daddy.
Oh, yeah.
Mama likey.
♪ ♪
Robin, over here.<br/>Ooh.
Eco-friendly.
She runs on corn.
Totally lady bone killer,<br/>but not an eight.
Everything's great.
And how are things<br/>for the old Barnacle?
Not an eight.
At best, she was a six,<br/>six and a half.
More like a four by the time<br/>I was done with her.
Mental self-five.
Everything's great.
To long-awaited MacLaren's<br/>return of Marshall and Lily.
Mmm.
I've missed this.<br/>Okay. We got to go.
W-what?<br/>You just got here.
I cleared my whole night<br/>for you guys.
I didn't even bring<br/>my booty-call phone.
Oh, I'm sorry,<br/>but we just really
need some time<br/>to ourselves.
I promise<br/>we'll hang out soon.
See you guys.<br/>Bye.

Yeah, like I'm going<br/>to leave this at home.
Barney Stinson.<br/>How may I direct my penis?
Oh, geez.
It is so nice to be out<br/>in the fresh air.
You smell that?<br/>Ooh.
That's the smell of urine<br/>that isn't Marvin's.
Oh, God, I miss that smell.
You know, I thought<br/>we'd spend the whole time
worrying about Marvin,<br/>but it's actually nice to be out
in the world, living life.
Yeah.
Death is all around us.
Wow, that urine smell<br/>just got a lot stronger.
So, you guys spent
your first night out<br/>in five months,
sitting at home planning<br/>for your own deaths?
Yeah, we found this Web site<br/>that helps you make a will.
In the event of your death...<br/>Ooh!
I'm sorry.
It-it's just-just real sad<br/>to think about.
Oh, I know.
All right.
In the event of your death...
Okay, no, you know what?
Let's just start<br/>with something easy.
Okay.<br/>Okay?
Please enter your zip code.
We'll never<br/>get mail again.
I keep reassuring Lily<br/>that this is all hypothetical.
Relatively speaking,<br/>New York City is very safe.
Please, faulty elevators,<br/>exploding man hole covers,
jealous husbands.<br/>Mmm.
This place is<br/>a coroner's paradise.
Ooh!
They are way more likely to eat<br/>it in a mugging gone wrong.
There was a double hommy<br/>on your block like a week ago.
Caught it on the scanner<br/>during lunch.
Knife job.
Guy made a real mess<br/>of it too.
Anyway,
then we got to the section<br/>about picking a guardian.
Sometimes couples choose one<br/>of their parents as a guardian.
That makes it simple.
My mom.
Your mom?
What's wrong with my mom?
Are you...
Fine. All right.
Marvin won't go<br/>to my loving mother.
But he's got to go to somebody.
Fine.
What about my mom?
Your mom?
Um, excuse...
Fine.
Not my mom.
What about my dad?
Your dad?
Okay, yeah, he's out.
Wait a minute.<br/>You know who could be good?
My brother Marcus.
He's like a great dad.
Do you remember<br/>his Christmas card?
Questionable denim choices<br/>aside, Marcus is a good dad.
I guess if Marvin has to go<br/>to anyone, it should be family.
Okay, great.
Okay.
Marcus, hey, how's it going?
Pretty freaking sweet, buttwipe.
I packed up all my crap; I said,<br/>"See ya" to Sarah and the kids;
and I finally got my dream job
as a mixologist down here<br/>at Carnalism 2.
Hold on.
Some punk's trying to use<br/>his snorkel rental as a bong.
Hey!
You be packin' that bowl<br/>too tight, mon.
So, now we don't<br/>have a guardian.
You know, as your best friend,
if called upon,<br/>I'd be honored to raise Marvin.
If you want him to be raised<br/>by his underwear on a flagpole,
Ted's your guy.
If you want him<br/>pulling the chord
on some other<br/>nerd's panties,
I'm your guy.
I'll teach that kid<br/>how to be awesome
in ways you and Lily<br/>never could.
It's going to be legend...
...wait for it,<br/>no, I won't wait for it
and neither should<br/>little baby Marvin,
so maybe it's better<br/>if you two just die right now...
...dary.
And so began the longest week<br/>of Lily and Marshall's lives.

You think you can bribe them<br/>with a stroller?
They already got one, foo.
Oh, this is no stroller, Robin.
I call it the Broller.
Go ahead. Look inside.
I don't get it.<br/>I don't see anything.
Yeah, but Papa does.
Those Robin's boobies?
When new nubile hotties lean in<br/>to inspect your bundle of joy,
you can inspect<br/>their bundles of joy.
The Broller.
God, I come up<br/>with a lot of good stuff.
Hey, guys, hey...
Hey.
Lily and I need you<br/>to come upstairs.
This is an important decision
and we can't have you<br/>constantly interrupting us
with this childish competition.
Which is why<br/>we're going to make it
an official competition!
We're going to play<br/>Who Wants to Be a Godparent?
Right after this word<br/>from our sponsors.
Why is he talking<br/>to the wall?
Wait, this is how you're going<br/>to choose a guardian for Marvin?
I mean, why don't<br/>you just put us
in a three-way cage match and<br/>go with whoever's left standing?
We talked about that, but it<br/>gave Robin an unfair advantage.
Yeah, you see,<br/>guys, we were
really struggling<br/>with this decision.
♪ All through the town. ♪
Babe, I know<br/>these guys have been
- a little over the top lately.<br/>- A little?
But we still have to pick<br/>a guardian just in case.
In case of what?
Don't make me say it.
Say it. I can handle it.
Say it.
In case we die.
How can you even say it?
And then I thought<br/>what do you do
if you got a wife<br/>who won't stop crying,
three idiots<br/>who won't stop bribing you,
and a universally beloved<br/>skill for gamesmanship?
You take a bunch<br/>of guardianship scenarios,
throw them on a wheel,<br/>buy your wife an expensive dress
so she'll participate.
I'm pretty again.
Bottom line is<br/>I just wanted
to make the idea<br/>of me and Lily dying...
fun.<br/>Oh.
Now, if you'll step behind<br/>your podiums, we'll get started.
Contestants,
here's how the game works.
Lily will spin that wheel.<br/>Not yet.
When it lands<br/>on a parenting issue,
you'll each describe how<br/>you would handle it with Marvin.
The contestant with the<br/>highest score gets to be
his godparent.
Ready to play?<br/>Great. Lily,
spin that wheel!
Okay, now, see, um, enthusiasm<br/>will factor into your scores.
So, I say again:
Lily, spin...
Spin that wheel!
♪ ♪
Ooh.
Our demise.
Barney, how would you
explain to little Marvin<br/>why we're not around anymore?
No.
Easy, all I'd have to do<br/>is change a few words
to one of my classics<br/>with the ladies.
The President of the World<br/>has called your parents away
on a super-secret<br/>space mission.
For the sake of the planet,<br/>you will never see them again.
Now pick up your toys<br/>and say good night to Daddy.
What do you know?<br/>That last line stays the same.
Judges?
Okay, Robin,
what would you do, and remember,
"President of the World<br/>called parents away
for a super-secret space<br/>mission" has already been taken.
Well, my dad was always upfront<br/>and honest with me,
so that's how I would be.
All right, kid, here's<br/>the deal with the deal.
Your mom and dad are done-ski.
Belly-flopped<br/>off a subway platform.
Mom busted open like a piñata.
What was left of your dad<br/>hung around for a few days.
Anyway, plug's pulled.<br/>Organs donated.
Long story short: I'm your<br/>new mommy now. (chuckles)
Sah-wish!
Well, I was saving these<br/>for the showcase,
but here.<br/>Hey, Lily, look, baby,
his-and-her watches.
Ooh.
Ted, the category's all yours.
Okay, here's what I would say.
Well, Marvin, explaining<br/>where your parents are
isn't gonna be easy.
Even I-- Lily and Marshall's<br/>best friend
for almost 20 years--
will have<br/>a hard time doing it.
But I do know a guy who's very<br/>good at this sort of thing.
Professor Infosaurus!
Hey, there, squirt!
Death is a difficult<br/>yet unfortunate certainty.
Good enough!<br/>Ted wins the round!
Yes! Yes!<br/>You'll see.
Professor Infosaurus will be<br/>a big, big hit with children.
Isn't that right, kids?
Moving on.
"Discipline."
"How would you handle Marvin
taking another kid's toy?"<br/>Barney?
That's easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br/>I'm calling Child Services.
Wait for it.
I'll return your $1,900<br/>alligator-skin belt
when you return that toy.
Until then, you can wear<br/>this disgusting
black-and-brown reversible belt.
Hey, I don't like it<br/>any more than you do!
Ted, how would you discipline<br/>little Marvin?
I would be firm.
Fair, but firm.
You, sir, just lost<br/>your television privileges.
Okay, you can watch TV,<br/>but nothing violent.
Okay, it can be violent,
but you have<br/>to do the dishes first.
Okay, I'll do the dishes,<br/>you watch TV.
Let's go get some ice cream!<br/>Come on!
But no sprinkles.
Robin?
Okay, sprinkles.
Um, I would do what my dad did:<br/>tough love.
You know where<br/>you're headed, chief?
The British Columbia<br/>Military School for Boys.
Of course, you're actually a<br/>boy, so at least you won't have
to shave off all your hair and<br/>burn your "girlie" clothing in
an old oil drum while<br/>your father stands there
and laughs at you<br/>through the flames!
Oh, my God!
I think that Robin wins<br/>this round
because we love her and she's<br/>in a safe space, right, guys?
Robin matters!
Yay! Totally.
Now, that's just<br/>one point, right?
Lily.
A spin... that... wheel!
Oh...
"Birds and Bees."
Barney, "How would you teach<br/>young Marvin
about the facts of life?"
Hmm...
You're gonna love<br/>Amsterdam, little bro.
Okay, Barney's out<br/>of this round.
Ted, how would you handle<br/>"the talk"?
Well, Marvin would be<br/>a young adult,
so you wouldn't want<br/>to talk down to him.
But that doesn't mean<br/>you can't get down with him.

I'm sorry, don't you need
to actually have had sex<br/>in order to explain it?
Professor Infosaurus also has<br/>a rap about ignoring bullies.
Robin? Birds and bees?
Well, I, for one, don't think
you have to teach Marvin<br/>a thing.
If he's anything like his dad,<br/>he's a natural-born stud.
Lily got a little braggy
at a cucumber stand once,<br/>big guy.
Robin wins again!
Oh, come on!<br/>That's clearly pandering!
A spin...
that... wheel!
We played long into the night,
eventually making it<br/>to the dreaded...
Lightning round!
First word!
Oh.<br/>Ooh...
Actually, that's a joist,
which carries the stress<br/>of the ceiling
versus the primary<br/>architectural load.
But that's my boy!
Ooh.
Nerd!
That's my boy!
First heartbreak!
I know this hurts,<br/>little buddy,
but you'll love again someday,
because time will heal<br/>a broken heart.
But not that bitch's window.
Run!
Yeah, right.
I've seen Barney throw.
He's no Vinnie Pestano,<br/>am I right?
Beloved Indians'<br/>middle reliever.
Cleveland sports<br/>are still relevant.
LeBron who? Right, guys?
Ted, neither you nor Cleveland
knows how to get over<br/>someone leaving them.
Here's how you'd<br/>handle heartbreak.
Cheer up, squirt.
There are plenty of other<br/>wonderful women out there.
But I thought<br/>that she was the one.
I'll be at<br/>Uncle Barney's.
This is ridiculous.
I've known you for 16 years.
I'm the obvious choice.
Oh, come on,<br/>if Ted raises him,
the poor kid's still gonna<br/>be a virgin when he's 13.
I'm the obvious choice.<br/>Hey, look, as the only one of us
packing a vag, I got<br/>a natural instinct
for nurturing<br/>and crap like that.
Plus, I can teach him<br/>how to bow hunt.
Yeah, I could do that.<br/>I am Barney Stinson!
Guys, guys, guys!
Okay!<br/>All right!
Obviously, none of you knows<br/>what it really means
to be a parent.
Well...<br/>obviously, neither of you
know what it means<br/>to be a friend anymore.
What are you<br/>talking about?
Think about it.
This is the most<br/>we've seen you two
in five months.
You don't<br/>seem to care
what's going on<br/>in our lives
unless it's<br/>an eight or higher.
Well, what do you expect?
We have a baby now.<br/>Yeah.
The days of closing down<br/>MacLaren's are over.
Unless you want
to get up with us<br/>at 5:13 in the morning
with a screaming baby.
So that's it?
The... the end of an era,<br/>just like that?
Look... we're sorry<br/>if-if we don't have time
to sit around the bar listening<br/>to silly little dating problems.
When you have
a baby, it's not just the most<br/>important thing in your life,
it's the only<br/>important thing.
When are you guys<br/>gonna get that?
Think we get it.
♪ ♪
I can't believe<br/>they just walked out.
Yeah. Maybe it's<br/>for the best.
Barney was starting<br/>to pull ahead.
I mean, how selfish can they be?
We're trying to raise<br/>a child here.
I'm sorry if I don't have time<br/>to deal with Ted's...
um.... o-or Robin's...
um...
or-or Barney's...
mm...
Huh.
You know, we were about to name<br/>one of them Marvin's godparent,
and... I can't tell you
what's going on<br/>in any of their lives.
Do you think that maybe
we've been a little crappy<br/>as friends lately?
Do you really know<br/>how to bow hunt?
Um, yeah.
At the British Columbia<br/>Military School for Boys
we called it "making lunch."
Hey, guys.
We asked Mickey<br/>to watch Marvin
so we could come<br/>down and talk.
I know that we didn't get<br/>to finish the game, but...
we've reached a decision.
Lily?
We've decided...
...to revoke the<br/>"eight or higher" rule.
What?
We want to know everything
that's going on<br/>with you guys.
Really?
You're our best friends.
Everything is an eight<br/>or higher.
And for the first time<br/>in almost half a year,
Lily and Marshall<br/>closed down MacLaren's.
Anyway,
Victoria's dad and I are<br/>working out a payment plan
with a very reasonable<br/>interest rate.

At least,<br/>Nick's cycle
is fuel-efficient--<br/>we're getting, like,
30, 35 miles to the cob.
Really?<br/>Yeah.
You know, I should've
told you about that<br/>six and a half sooner.
Barney Stinson banging<br/>anything less than an eight?
That's like a 15.
And it was a great night.
Until...
Go<br/>back to bed.
We got this.

And Lily and Marshall<br/>finally decided
on a guardian.
Are you sure about this, baby?<br/>Yes.

Run!</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, it's no secret your Uncle<br/>Barney is a bit of a dog,
and even though he loved<br/>me, I think he always wanted
a wingman who was a bit of a dog, too.
And in the fall of 2012...
he found one.
Respect.
Hey, guys, thanks again for<br/>a great night last night.
I say again,
great night.
Ted, honey, it was not a great night.
Ted,
Lily and I noticed some<br/>things last night.
Hey, Ted, can you pass me a cracker?
- Yeah.<br/>- It's the least you can do,
considering I left a<br/>guy at the altar for you.
Right, right?
Oh, come on, that was a joke.
Women over 30 don't joke when<br/>it comes to commitment.
Victoria is happy we're<br/>taking things slow.
Oh, oh, honeysweetiebaby,
no 32-year-old<br/>woman
is happy taking things slow.
Mm.
Trust me, Victoria has<br/>got friends from high school
posting pictures of<br/>second babies on Facebook.
Mm-hmm.
And you think girlfriend's
all like, "Oh, let's just bone a bunch
so I'm another year<br/>older and still single"?
- Bitch, please.<br/>- Mm.
Guys, I've got a new bro...
a bro that puts all other bros to shame.
The bitches love him.
He buries bones all day.
Whoo!
No one chases tail like him.
Why aren't you guys laughing?
Oh, wait, I probably should<br/>have led with this:
He's a dog.
I've named him
Brover.
I'll go...
fetch him.
Okay, I'm worried about Barney.
That breakup with Quinn<br/>messed him up more than he let on.
I think he's lonely.
Dude seems fine to me.
I love you so much, Brover.
Seriously, based on last night,
you and Victoria are headed for trouble.
So I got this kind<br/>of interesting job offer
to run a bakery in Denver.
But that's too crazy, though, right?
Right?
Uh, yeah.
The high altitude would<br/>affect the density of the pastries.
I mean,
talk about half-baked.
Man, this is a great night.
That was Victoria asking<br/>you to move to Denver with her.
What?
Then, why wouldn't she<br/>just come right out
and say what she wants?
Men.
It's like, if there<br/>weren't pickle jars to open
and spiders to kill
and computers to back up,<br/>what would be their point?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, when did Marshall<br/>become a slightly more feminine you?
Look, Ted, it gets<br/>exhausting constantly giving people
advice they haven't asked<br/>for, so I'm training Marshall.
My goal is to eventually say things
that are so sassy and wise,
that there is no possible response
other than "mm" or "mm-hmm".
And if this is a place<br/>where we can share our dreams...
I like to think that it is...
I hope someday to earn a...
"testify".
Look, Victoria and I are five months in
and we're right where we should be.
All right, we-we're<br/>cosigning birthday cards,
w<br/>- we got toothbrushes at each other's places,
foreplay's out the window.
I'm in, I'm out, I'm<br/>sleeping, it's great.
It's more than five months.
You guys dated before, that time counts.
The clock doesn't reset to zero.
It un-pauses from where you left off.
No way,
no way, the clock resets.
Wait, so this is what you guys do?
You invite other couples over for dinner
to judge them and feel superior?
Oh, grow up, Ted,
that's why any couple invites<br/>anyone over ever.
Two Scotches, both neat,
and if you've got some...<br/>nuts, this guy lost a couple.
Ha-ha.
Take the hit, just take the hit.
Okay, this is a cry for help.
Can we invite Barney<br/>over for dinner tonight?
But I was going to make<br/>you a special meal to celebrate
my show getting nominated for<br/>a Local Area Media Award.
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention,
Nick had a cable access cooking show.
Chef Nick Podarutti uses
all fresh, locally grown ingredients,
but don't think for a second
that means he's not a bad boy.
She runs on corn.
# Nick the Bad Boy
# Chef...
I'm gonna invite him over for dinner.
Okay, fine, but you'd<br/>better make sure he has a ticket.
'Cause it's all<br/>aboard the Chow-Chow Train!
Honey, I know it's hard coming up
with a signature cooking catchphrase,
but I don't think that's it.
I know, but how do you<br/>compete with "Bam!"?
It just says it all.
Hey, you.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Um, Lily and Marshall think
I'm missing all these<br/>hints you're dropping
that you want a deeper commitment.
I mean, you'd just come right<br/>out and tell me, right?
Totally.
I think I can be a little<br/>bit more direct than that.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, I was<br/>cleaning my apartment today
and I dug this up.
Should I keep
this wedding dress, or do you think
I'll never, ever need it again?
So Lily and Marshall were right?
Of course they're right.
When a girl jumps in<br/>your car in a wedding dress,
you can't act surprised to find out
she wants to get married.
Besides, we dated<br/>before, and that time counts.
We just hit pause on the clock.
See, a lot of really smart people
would argue the clock resets.
It un-pauses, everybody knows that.
You know, Barney's a little late.
I hope he's okay.
Ah, he's fine, and I still don't think
he's crying out for help.
Well...
Sorry we're late.
We just came from the tailor.
Brover couldn't settle on a<br/>tie, so I just bought them all.
You say no to that face.
There's a reason that you're not
a hundred percent in this with me, Ted.
Something's holding us back.
Well, what is it?
I think we've established I'm not great
at picking up on<br/>clues... well, in this situation.
As a kid, I was known as<br/>a bit of a detective.
In fact, when my<br/>friend's retainer went missing,
the Mosby Boys were put<br/>on the case, and it was...
The retainer was in the garbage.
The Mosby Boys were you, your sister,
and a neighborhood<br/>squirrel you thought you had tamed.
I can't believe Squirrel-lock<br/>Holmes turned on us like that.
Eight weeks of training down the drain.
You know how I know that, Ted?
Because we covered it in<br/>the "getting to know you" part
of the relationship six years ago.
Six years.
Then... what's holding us back?
Call in the Mosby Boys, Ted,
let me know if they crack the case.
Guys,
Brover is not only the<br/>best bro I've ever had,
he's amazing with the ladies.
I'm sorry, don't you<br/>think it's a little pathetic
to use a dog to pick up chicks?
Sir, wingmanship is a two-way street.
If Brover meets a<br/>cutie, I'll take the hit
and chat up the chubby lady friend.
Sometimes I'll be the jerk...
so Brover can swoop<br/>in and be the hero.
And like any good wingman,
I gather as much intel<br/>as I can right up front.
How old's your dog?
- She's five.<br/>- Oh.
What's that in dog years?
Like, 35.
We're done here.
Well, you were right.
Victoria says<br/>something's holding us back,
and I don't have any idea what it is.
Any brilliant insights, Oprah?
Steadman?
Um, try Gayle.
Marshall, I want you to take this one.
You're ready.
Oh, I don't know.
Although I do hear this<br/>little voice in the back of my head
trying to tell me something.
That's your inner goddess.
Listen to her, channel her.
If Victoria quenches your
thirst like a tall glass
of sweet tea on a hot July day...
Marshall, why is she Southern?
Don't let him break the connection.
well, you got to make
an honest woman out of her.
Okay, I'm leaving.
But, but,
if not, well, then, sugar...
you got to let that nightingale
spread her wings and soar
to her own beautiful tomorrow.
Testify.
You guys are the worst.
Where am I?
Sorry.
Uh, go for Barney.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Totally understood.
I'll do that.
Great.
Thank you.
That was Brover's owner.
I guess, while she was
out of town, he ran<br/>away from his kennel,
and now that she's<br/>back, I have to return him.
Oh, Barney, I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's all good.
Um, excuse me for one moment.
Hey, Barney.
No, no. No, no!
Oh.
Wha...
Victoria.
Will you marry me?
Yes, of course.
There's just one thing.
Anything. You name it.
You can't be friends with Robin.
You won't marry me if I'm<br/>still friends with Robin?
Wait. She's the thing<br/>that's been holding us back?
There-There's just<br/>too much history there.
I mean, Robin's the<br/>reason that we broke up
the first time<br/>around. Robin's our roadblock.
Robin's the deep, dark pit
where our relationship goes to die.
But nicest girl in the<br/>world. Salt of the earth.
But she's with Nick now.
I mean, sure, his cooking show is lousy
with awkward catchphrase attempts.
Oh, my gosh, who's ready to nosh?
Who's popping a chub for some grub?
I offer my deepest apologies
to anyone who was offended by<br/>my "popping a chub" remark.
I can and will do better.
Won't happen again.
And now who's ready to eat my meat?
Oh, come on.
But Robin's happy with Nick,
and I'm happy with you.
Look, I,
I just asked you to be my wife.
Isn't that proof there's<br/>nothing between me and Robin?
Well, maybe today there isn't,
but what about tomorrow?
Or next week or 15 years from now?
I'll always be wondering.
I never wanted to be that girl who says
it's Robin or it's me,
but, well...
It's Robin or it's you.
You've been a hell of a wingman.
And even though I<br/>think it's kind of gross
when you pleasure yourself orally,
don't ever think
that means I'm not impressed.
Hey...
do you think that Barney's gonna be okay
bringing Brover back?
Yeah, he'll be fine.
It's not just the ability
to go to town on yourself,
but you do it with such joie de vivre.
I really think that<br/>I should go with him.
No, but you got to eat these cr?pes
as soon as they're flamb?ed.
They're gonna be bon appe-sweet!
- No.<br/>- Damn.
We'll work on it when I get back.
No, I get it. You know,
I only spent all night working on these,
but, hey, Barney's more important.
- Nick...<br/>- It's fine. Go.
Anyway, let's not make a big deal of it.
We hung out for a few days,
had some fun...
No big woof.
I don't know who I am without you.
This is crazy.
Victoria is being<br/>completely unreasonable about Robin,
and my snap sister is gonna back me up.
I say again...
I kind of see Victoria's point.
Come again for Ms. Fudge?
Ted and Robin have so much history.
Exactly. History. Ancient history.
Ted, you said "I love<br/>you" to her earlier this year.
I'm not saying
this is fair, but I get it.
I didn't get that at all.
How could my inner<br/>goddess be so far off?
Oh, you'll get there, honey.
Oprah wasn't built in a day.
What?
I kind of went rogue.
Look, if you really want to have a baby,
just stop taking the pill.
You guys slept together at spring break
three years ago.
That means something.
Loves show tunes,
total shopaholic,
not always pestering you for sex?
Um, Clifford sounds like a keeper.
Marshall, all of that<br/>advice was terrible.
Not as terrible as you saying
that Ted and Robin should<br/>stop being friends.
I'm not saying they<br/>should. It would be horrible.
But if Ted really<br/>wants to be with Victoria...
Ted, tell her
that you're not gonna stop<br/>being friends with Robin.
I can't imagine life without Robin.
But she'll never be in love with me.
She'll never be my wife.
She'll never be the person<br/>I grow old with.
Victoria...
Victoria could be.
Are you saying what I<br/>think you're saying?
You ready to say good-bye?
Thanks for coming with me.
Oh, well, you did the same for me
back when I had to give<br/>away all my dogs. Remember?
Oh, yeah, we drove to<br/>your aunt's farm upstate.
She was awesome.
- Yeah.<br/>- I love how she was this
wise, old, chilled out,
lesbian farmer.
No, no, no. She's not a lesbian.
Nor does she farm them.
No, that woman she lives with,
that's just her special friend Maureen.
They've lived together for...
Oh.
Oh, this is gonna be tough.
Brover really was the best wingman ever.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for bringing
- Mr. Sprinkles back.<br/>- Mr. Sprinkles...
is a great name for a dog.
Mommy missed you so much.
Yes, she did.
Did this nice couple take care of you?
That's a laugh. Ha.
Big bro.
I got to split. Yeah, I got to,
I got to head back to the farm...
where I live with my special<br/>friend Maureen.
Whom I now realize
is my lesbian life partner.
Surprise.
Okay. All right.
So...
would you like a drink?
Best wingman ever.
Hey.
What's all this?
I thought you were mad at me.
I was...
but then I realized
I just have to accept that<br/>you have close guy friends.
I mean, I don't want it becoming a habit
that they steal you away from<br/>me in the middle of the night.
But...
Oh, sorry.
Oh, Ted needs to see me.
- Oh, for the love of God, woman.<br/>- Oh, it's not
what you think. He<br/>just wants to have sex.
Kidding.
Just a little hand stuff.
Ha. Kidding again.
Ted's more of a boob<br/>man. I seriously can't stop.
- What does he want?<br/>- Um...
I don't know, but he says it's urgent.
I'm so sorry.
Just one more little steal-away.
Just as long as he gives you back.
Thanks.
So...
are you okay?
What is this big, urgent thing
that couldn't wait till tomorrow?
There's something I have to tell you.
Um...
I've thought about this a ton,
and...
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this,
but...
I'm not in love with Robin...
but she's like family to me, and...
I can't end that.
So...
can you accept that?
I really hope you get her some day.
Hey, guys.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
So, last night
Ted calls me out to the bar to<br/>talk about something urgent.
Guess what it was.
He wants to write
a series of young adult mystery novels
called The Mosby Boys.
Why did you need to tell me that?
You work in the media. You know people.
Okay, well, first of<br/>all, lose the Mosby nerds
and focus on that<br/>crime-solving squirrel.
- That guy is gold.<br/>- Yeah.
And secondly, next time
you have a big idea late at night,
please bug your girlfriend about it.
Uh, actually...
Victoria and I broke up.
Oh, my God.
Why, what, what happened?
We just, you know, wanted<br/>different things.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
But, bright side...
Robin is gonna be so touched
when she hears you<br/>ended things with Victoria
because of her.
She can never know.
Promise me Robin will never find out.
I don't understand.
Promise.
- Promise.<br/>- Promise.
Of course,
Robin did find out.
But we'll get to that.
So you do have balls?
Run!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">In the fall of 2012...
Nick and Robin were going strong.
Sometimes it's hard to say what it is<br/>exactly that makes a couple click.
Wow.
- Bravissimol<br/>- Yeah.
Whatever it was...
kids, Nick and Robin<br/>really connected at first.
Hey, you know, I think I'm really starting<br/>to feel something here.
And...
But then, as often happens,<br/>they started to drift apart.
Why? Who can say?
Nick and I haven't had sex in three days.
And it's your fault.
Nick won't have sex because<br/>he pulled his groin muscle...
all 'cause you made him join<br/>your stupid basketball team.
- Did you say "stupid basketball team"?<br/>- Yeah.
Oh, my gosh. Guys, we have<br/>to rush Robin to the hospital...
because, somehow,<br/>she swallowed her vocal cords...
and they got lodged in her rectum...
Because she's talking out of her ass.
Over the summer...
Marshall had joined<br/>a Midtown professionals basketball league.
His team of lawyers<br/>was called the Force Majeures.
Ever since they lost<br/>to a group of accountants...
he'd started getting<br/>a little intense about it.
You sure you didn't have<br/>a ringer or two out there, Joel?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Good hustle out there, Aboubakar!
If Joel can use ringers, then so can we.
And Nick is our best player, so as far as I'm<br/>concerned, you can both keep your groins on ice.
Groins on Ice. Least popular<br/>Madison Square Garden holiday show ever.
Why are you so into this basketball league?
Robin, it's the Little Ivies<br/>Professionals Over 30...
Who Work in Midtown League.
It's The Showl
You know, it's kind of funny...
imagining people icing their groins.
First they'd be all cold, and...
and then the ice would start to melt...
and... things would get<br/>all wet and... steamy.
Okay, Lily.
Look, buddy,<br/>I'm also the captain of a team...
in the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30<br/>Who Work In Midtown League.
I'm addicted to the adrenaline too.
Still, don't you think<br/>you're getting a little obsessive about...
Uh, hold up. Hold up. Are you suggesting<br/>that you are a member of a sports team...
and you're the captain?
So says the "C" I personally sewed onto my jersey.
Uh, after Victoria and I broke up,<br/>I had some free time.
So... called up a few architect friends...
and put together<br/>a little team called the T-Squares.
See that? The floor's uneven.
And that window placement is rubbish.
You know, if a genie gave me one wish...
I would knock down that wall<br/>and create a nice flow.
Great wish.
There's too much hard wood, right?
Did you nerds actually play any basketball?
Um, us nerds focused on something<br/>far more important...
bonding.
You guys are gonna get pounded.
And I am not.
Oh, come on. You can't go<br/>a couple weeks without sex?
Our point guard's a 52-year-old virgin,<br/>happy as a clam.
I'm sure he's quite a ball handler.
The problem is, now that we're<br/>not having sex, we're talking more...
and I'm realizing<br/>that Nick is kind of... dumb.
- Really?<br/>- News to me. - No.
- I hadn't noticed that.<br/>- Oh, my God.
You guys think that he's dumb too?
- So dumb.<br/>- Air bags are sharper.
- Hot as lava but just as thick.<br/>- Mm.
Wow. When did you guys start to notice...
that he was kind of dumb?
Well, there was the time<br/>Nick was doing the crossword.
Hey, what's a four-letter word for "cut"?
- Nick.<br/>- Yeah?
Is a four-letter word for "cut."
- What is?<br/>- Nick.
What? Oh. I got it.
Shave.
And there was the comment about Gypsies.
No, no. L-I think Gypsies<br/>prefer to be called Romani now.
Do they? Really?
And what do unicorns and, uh, elves...
and leprechauns prefer to be called?
You do know, uh...
Gypsies are a real ethnic group<br/>that actually exists?
Oh, you guys, I feel terrible now.
I always thought they were just made up,<br/>like goblins or trolls or dolphins.
And then there's that story you told...
about how you and Nick picked up<br/>that Danish exchange student...
and you all took a shower together.
I never told a story like that.
Well, no time like the present.
Let's give this Danish ho a name.
I'm thinking Nadia. Yeah.
She sounds slutty and bi-curious.
What is wrong with you?
Your kid is right there.<br/>Maybe you wanna clean it up a lit...
You're wearing a baby and you're doing pull-ups?
No, Ted. I'm sitting around getting soft<br/>'cause that's what champions do.
You know, the problem is...
now that I know how dumb Nick is...
- it's kind of making me reconsider the relationship.<br/>- Why?
Eventually, Nick's groin will heal,<br/>and you'll be back in Sexville...
where all the crossword puzzles<br/>only have one box to fill.
Talk about a double standard.
Every time I go after a busty dullard<br/>who can't tell time...
or thinks I'm the ghost of<br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm shallow.
But somehow it's okay for Robin to date<br/>a guy who can't be trusted around outlets.
Dump him!
Okay. That is ridiculous.
Is Nick a genius? No.
But does he have average intelligence?
No.
But he is a human being with a heart.
And you're afraid, if I dump him,<br/>it'll throw off his game.
Robin, he got 36 points<br/>and 17 rebounds last week.
And that was with his shoes on the wrong feet.
Well, you're probably all wondering...
how the T-Squares' practice went today.
- The T-what?<br/>- We played up here.
Basketball, people don't realize, is all<br/>geometry, physics and engineering.
If you think like an architect, you could win a<br/>thousand games without ever touching a ball.
What happened to your ball?
Some kids from the Hebrew school next door<br/>took it and wouldn't give it back.
Oy.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
How'd the breakup with Nick go?
Well...
So I went to this fortune-teller today...
and she said there was a curse on me.
Did she sell you something<br/>to ward off the curse?
It's like you're a fortune-teller too.
- Nick, um, I think we need to talk.<br/>- Yeah.
Uh. It's just...
Oh! These are hard.
Anyway, this $500 bracelet will ward off<br/>evil till the end of the week, so...
Do you think that you could do,<br/>uh, sit-ups or something while you talk?
Yeah.
Anyway, this fortune-teller... she was able to<br/>tell me all sorts of stuff about my future...
just from my credit cards...
and my Social Security number,<br/>my driver's license...
I knew you'd cave.<br/>Which is why I came up...
with a little extra incentive<br/>to break up with Nick.
End it by 8:00 p.m. Tonight<br/>or this invite goes live.
"Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day"?
Kids, Patrice was a coworker of Robin's...
who'd become sort of obsessed with her.
Robin had managed until now<br/>to keep Patrice at arm's length.
But if Patrice were invited to something<br/>called "Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day'...
she'd latch onto Robin and never let go.
Why would you do that?
- Delete that right now!<br/>- No!
If I don't give you a little push, you'll let<br/>this drag on until Nick can have sex again...
and then you'll be right back<br/>to procrastinating on all fours.
I hate to admit it,<br/>but the man in the suit has a point.
Oh! Fine.
But the play-offs are coming up soon, and<br/>I can't have this guy an emotional wreck.
If you do dump him,<br/>at least let him down easy.
Yeah. Take him to a nice restaurant,<br/>preferably a dessert place.
That way you won't have to sit through<br/>a whole meal before you get to...
- Splitsville.<br/>- Exactly.
No, Splitsville.
It's a dessert place<br/>right around the corner.
It's sort of the place<br/>to end a relationship.
Uh, Nick, listen.
- You are awesome and totally sweet.<br/>- Mmm.
But we're just not...
You know where I'm going with this, right?
No. No clue.
Um...
I don't know if we should<br/>keep seeing each other.
You wanna start turning off<br/>the lights during sex?
No! God, no. No, no.
I am just worried that as a couple<br/>we're not working out.
You wanna start going to the gym together?
Okay, no, Nick. Here is the deal. Okay.
- Um, sorry, babe. I gotta take this. Excuse me.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Hello? Hey, what's up?
You... Well, I... I'd...<br/>I don't understand.
But you don't...
Okay. Um, you know what?<br/>I'm sorry. L-l... I have to go.
- What happened?<br/>- I...
I, um...
Oh! I'm sorry. I can't talk about this.
Anyway...
what were you gonna say?
Uh, I was gonna say...
order whatever else you want.
It's on me.
Well, thanks, but I think<br/>I'd just rather eat it out of a bowl.
Well, no doubt you're all wondering<br/>how the T-Squares' first game went.
- What squares?<br/>- Picture a well-oiled machine.
Your sewing machine?
There were two seconds left on the clock.
Aboubakar was all over me.
And that's when all my years<br/>of architectural training came to my aid.
I saw the space in a way<br/>my opponents never would.
Yes!
I told you guys I'd make one of these.
Turns out those two points were taken away because<br/>apparently the ball went "out of bounds."
But don't worry.<br/>I'm appealing to the league office.
This Aboubakar,<br/>I-I'm assuming you showered with the guy?
Paint me a word picture.
Hello?
Lil, is Barney there?<br/>He's not answering his phone.
Mm. He's a little busy right now.<br/>It's Robin.
Thirty-seven, 38.<br/>Put her on speaker. Thirty-nine.
When did you start being able<br/>to do stuff like this? A few months ago...
you had to catch your breath<br/>after making a sandwich.
Barney, delete the "Robin and Patrice<br/>BFF Fun Day"invite.
- Did you break up with Nick yet?<br/>- I can't.
He just got some horrible call.
I think a family member<br/>might have died or something.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
No, I mean, good that Robin can't dump him.
The death part, less good.
Robin, if you dump Nick...
he could get mad<br/>and-and tear your blouse off.
And then he bites you on the neck...<br/>not super hard...
just on the brink<br/>between pleasure and pain.
And then that Danish slut, Nadia,<br/>bursts in...
You can't wait. His groin will heal.
And then, before you know it,<br/>you'll be marrying a man...
who once ate a vanilla-scented candle.
That was on me.<br/>I shouldn't have left it in the kitchen.
Though it was lit. Man, he dumb!
- The invite goes live in five minutes.<br/>- What?
It goes out automatically unless I stop it.
And that only happens if I hear you<br/>dump Nick on speakerphone before then.
Fine.
Hey, Nick. I'm sorry about that.
Um, listen.
- There's something I need to talk to you about.<br/>- No, Robin, I'm sorry.
I'm, like, half here.
That phone call, it just...<br/>I got some really bad news.
My doctor did an M.R. I. And...
Oh. Oh, God. What... What is it?
My groin injury is worse than they thought.
I can't play basketball for weeks.
Oh, thank God.<br/>I thought he was dying or something.
How many weeks?<br/>How many weeks?
Please tell me it's not a tear<br/>in the iliolumbar ligament.
It's a tear in the libial<br/>flum-flar liniment.
If it's a small tear,<br/>he can still make play-offs.
- It's a big tear.<br/>- He better not be out for the season.
- I'm out for the season.<br/>- Damn it!
They're going up against<br/>the Number Crunchers without me.
It's an after-work basketball league<br/>for lawyers and accountants...
and architects who sew.
I mean, who takes it that seriously?
No!
I just hate letting Coach Eriksen down.
I would follow that man<br/>through the gates of hell.
Winning.
What do we win...
when we beat those Number Crunchers<br/>a few short weeks hence?
A game? Sure.
A trophy? Sort of.
We win a $25 gift card to Bennigan's.
But what is it that we really win?
- The game!<br/>- Yes, I said that, Nick.
Yeah.
But we also win the right to walk tall.
Oh!
The right to call ourselves champions.
- Yeah.<br/>- So we are gonna go out...
and we are gonna wipe the floor<br/>with those accountants.
And afterwards, we will feast like kings...
on Southwest Fajitas and Cajun Shrimp!
And that check... That check will be<br/>marginally less expensive!
Yeah! Yeah!
Now they're probably gonna have to pay<br/>full price for that meal.
Nick.
- You are so sweet. But I just...<br/>- Good news is...
it doesn't really matter if it takes<br/>my groin pull a little longer to heal...
so may as well start having sex again.
- Listening.<br/>- Sickening.
Exiting.
- Nick...<br/>- Huh?
I just, uh...
I...
- Hmm?<br/>- Um...
- Mm-hmm?<br/>- Uh... Oh, God.
- What do you think?<br/>- Oh.
- I think I am suddenly in the mood for something hot.<br/>- Oh, I see.
Sounds like I should order<br/>some cappuccinos.
- Wait, don't talk till tomorrow morning.<br/>- Okay.
She can't go home with you, Nick.
- Barney!<br/>- Why not?
Because Robin and I are in love.
Barney, what are you doing here?
Taking care of something<br/>you clearly can't do on your own.
I'm sorry, but you and Robin are done.
What? Robin, what is this?
Uh, Barney, look, I know<br/>what you're doing, okay? Please stop.
Robin doesn't want to hurt your feelings<br/>because you're a nice guy.
But she thinks you're stupid,<br/>and she hates you. You're welcome.
- Stop doing this.<br/>- I love her, Nick.
Look, he doesn't love me.
He's just saying this<br/>because he thinks that...
I love everything about her.<br/>And I'm not a guy who says that lightly.
I'm a guy who has faked love<br/>his entire life.
I thought love was just something<br/>idiots thought they felt.
But this woman has a hold on my heart<br/>that I could not break if I wanted to.
And there have been times that I wanted to.
It has been overwhelming and humbling...
and even painful at times.
But I could not stop loving her any more<br/>than I could stop breathing.
I am hopelessly, irretrievably<br/>in love with her.
More than she knows.
Robin, is this true?
You heard him.
Oh, wow.
It feels like I have<br/>a pulled groin muscle... in my heart.
Nick, I... I'm so sorry.
I just think that maybe...
Pardon me...
but did you just also<br/>get your heart broken?
Yes.
I just got my heart broken too!
Well, do the... the<br/>two of you wanna come back to my place?
Yes!
Thus concluded the autumn of breakups.
Wow.
Crazy, right?
Yeah. You know what'd be really crazy?<br/>If all of 'em got it on.
Barney, Robin, Nick and those two women.
And you just know Nadia's<br/>watching in the corner with her pet snake.
Okay, why aren't you two having sex?
- What?<br/>- Excuse me?
Lily has been slobbering<br/>over Robin's sex life...
like a cartoon hobo<br/>watching a pie cool on a windowsill.
And you... The only other time<br/>you've ever exercised this seriously...
was when Lily had mono freshman year...
and I caught you doing one-armed push-ups<br/>with your genitals over a bowl of ice.
So when did you stop doing it and why?
It was, you know...
before Marvin was born.
What? The... That's insane.
Well, you have to wait a while<br/>after having a kid, and...
and then you're exhausted<br/>from being up all night.
And then this uncanny phenomenon began.
Wow. You guys gotta fix this.
It's not that easy. I...
Ted, having a kid changes things.
You don't have the time or energy.<br/>You're never alone.
- Come here.<br/>- What are you doing?
Taking Marvin for a walk<br/>so you guys can have some privacy.
Oh.<br/>Ted, come on.
That's-That's just not<br/>the way that it works.
Yeah, it's not like we can have sex on cue.
Yeah, I'll give you guys plenty of time.
Maybe I'll even swing by the gym...
show Marvin where<br/>his Uncle Ted made the shot.
If I'm late, it's 'cause<br/>I've been delayed by autograph seekers.
Whoop. Forgot Marvin's diaper bag.
Yowza! Ooh! Okay.
And the Oscar for Best Fake Romantic Speech<br/>goes to Barney Stinson.
I'd like to thank<br/>all the ladies over the years...
with whom I've practiced<br/>fake romantic speeches.
And, of course, Robin Scherbatsky<br/>for being so hypnotized by hog...
that she needed me to come and save her.
You know what? I didn't need your help.
You were this close to ripping off<br/>his misbuttoned shirt...
and pulling down his inside-out underpants.
I'll give you this.<br/>You were pretty convincing.
Hey, tricking good-looking idiots<br/>is kind of my thing.
No.
I mean, you were really convincing.
Please. I was broing you out.
I'm just glad he bought it so quick.
Any longer, I'd have had to kiss you.
- Hello.<br/>- Whoo! Oh, my God, Robin. BFF Fun Day!
- That's the most amazing thing ever. You totally read my mind.<br/>- Hey, Patrice.
- That's exactly what I wanna do for my birthday. I just...<br/>- Oh. You got the invite. Great.
- Uh, yeah. Uh, let me call you back.<br/>- This is so fantastic!
- I can't even catch my breath! Yay! Yay! Yay!<br/>- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
You know what I forgot to do?
♪ Like a fool,<br/>I went and stayed too long ♪
♪ Now I'm wondering<br/>if your love's still strong ♪
♪ Ooh, baby Here I am ♪
♪ Signed, sealed, delivered<br/>I'm yours ♪ ♪
Hey, T-Squares. Well, bad news.
Heard back from the league office.<br/>My shot is not gonna count.
But onwards and upwards, right?
What did you cats wanna rap about? Hmm?
Listen, Coach. You're great.
And we all really want to stay friends.
I can change. I can...
Come on, we... We had some good times.
Things have been weird lately.
Is there another architect? Just tell me.

[<div class="full-script">Guys, I'm going<br/>through something kinda hard.
Since Quinn and I broke<br/>up, she's gone back to dancing
at The Lusty Leopard, and it's<br/>just really tough because...
'Cause you have to<br/>find a new strip club?
I have to find a new strip club!
I've been going to The Lusty<br/>Leopard for seven years.
Wow. That's like 49 in perv years.
Sixty-nine.<br/>Self-five.
Look...
without my open wallet,
The Lusty Leopard would be nothing.
Thanks to me,<br/>they've been able to expand
and take over that soup<br/>kitchen next door.
Now I'm a free agent,
and all the strip clubs are after me.
Mr. Stinson, we might not have
the best strippers at Moneyballs,
but we use sabermetrics to get<br/>you a stripper with a five body,
sure, and another with a<br/>butter face, but together,
with their tireless<br/>grinding, we guarantee
a high on-pants percentage.
I gotta be honest with you, Fred,
I can't really see myself signing<br/>with the Golden Oldies.
Well, that's what<br/>everyone says... at first.
But our GILFs have got class.
They've got maturity and experience,
and the kind of<br/>mind-blowing flexibility
that only comes from<br/>advanced hip dysplasia.
Barney, the Lusty Leopard<br/>would be lost without you.
I think you're really gonna<br/>like a couple of the girls
we just pulled up from the minors.
Don't leave us!
Wow, you're like the LeBron<br/>James of strip clubs.
Actually, you're probably tied<br/>with LeBron James for that title.
LeBron isn't all that.
The Cavs are doing great without him.
Yeah!
Hey, guys, you will<br/>never believe who I ran into
outside of work today.
It wasn't the guy handing out coupons
in the hot dog costume, was it?
Baby, there's no<br/>reason to be scared of him.
I'm not scared of him.
It's totally normal to<br/>see a hot dog with a face.
No, it was Brad, my<br/>old law school buddy.
I almost didn't recognize him.
Marshall?
Brad?
Bro!
Oh, hey!
What a kick-ass day!
I run into you, some sucker throws away
most of a perfectly good hot dog...
kick-ass day!
You still doing corporate law?
I got downsized two years ago.
It's been rough.
Going through a little bit of a depresh.
But just today, boom!
Huge job prospect.
Here's your application.
Just tell them I sent you.
I bet you could fit in the bratwurst.
Bratwurst with a face.
What'd I tell you?
Looks like I'm about to be on a roll.
Sounds like that<br/>guy could use some help.
I know! That's why I said...
You know, I'm at Honeywell &amp; Cootes,
and they're looking<br/>to hire an associate.
I could totally recommend you.
Leave the wounded behind!
'Cause Brad is an old<br/>friend who needs a job.
Why shouldn't I give him the old
Marshall Eriksen Stamp of Approval?
Marshall, you're a stamp tramp.
How dare you!
And what is that?
You give your stamp of<br/>approval to everything.
It's become meaningless.
It's like when my mom likes a movie.
It just means Richard Dreyfuss is in it.
Marshall, you love everything<br/>and everyone.
It's-It's what I love about you,
but it's also why your<br/>stamps are total crap.
Give me one example.
How about when you turned your boss
into a fountain of bodily liquids?
You guys like it?
I'll be waiting for<br/>you in hell, Eriksen.
In my defense, that<br/>restaurant's health rating had just gone
from an "F" to a "D," and<br/>I wanted to reward that.
Marshall, you're already on thin ice
with that horrible Honeywell guy.
Don't risk screwing things<br/>up more right before
your biggest case ever.
Okay, Honeywell is not horrible,
he just has a bad temper sometimes.
And he holds a grudge.
He's kind of defensive about his height.
And he's cheap.
And he made those secretaries cry.
But, deep down, he is a great guy.
Heck, he gets my stamp, too.
Stamp tramp.
Well, maybe this isn't the moment
to stick your neck out for Brad.
Well, that's not how I was raised.
Back in St. Cloud, we believe in people,
people like Gudren Olsen, the<br/>town wino who became our mayor.
They even wound up<br/>naming a bridge after him.
The one he drove off.
Marshall, why can't you<br/>be more like your wife?
Lily's stamp is gold.
I'm reading this book because of her.
I'm drinking this beer because<br/>she recommended it.
I'm even wearing this bra because
of a lingerie store Lily told me about.
Uh, if anyone's got the golden stamp,
it's old Teddy Westside over here.
Please. You're a piggyback stamper.
How dare you!
And what is that?
Allow us to demonstrate. Lily?
Hey, guys, I just found a<br/>great new sushi restaurant.
It's called Katsu...
yoku. Katsuyoku.
My idea. I'm Ted.
- Nailed it.<br/>- Totally.
Okay, Ted, name one<br/>cool thing you've given
your stamp to first...<br/>- Dr. Berkowitz.
that isn't an<br/>ear, nose and throat doctor.
Man, these strip clubs want me so bad.
They're sending me<br/>T-shirts, beer cozies.
Sticky's even sent me
a boob-shaped hand-sanitizer<br/>dispenser.
It's clean and dirty at the same time.
That's it? T<br/>- shirts and beer cozies?
That's disrespect, son!
Here's what you do:
Hit a few strip clubs in<br/>Jersey and Long Island.
Jersey? Long Island?
Why would I go to a Third World nation
to get my knob wobbled?
Well, you wouldn't.
But when the clubs in the city hear
you're sniffing around across the river,
those beer cozies and T-shirts turn
into Rolexes and fur coats.
Especially from that<br/>strip club, Fur Coats.
Wow. That's genius.
You're hired.
What do you mean?
I want you to be my strip club agent.
What is wrong with you?
Well, I just figured I'd ask...
No, I was talking to myself,
because, for some reason,<br/>I really want to do that!
Oh! Oh! What am I wearing?
Just proof of a<br/>stamp I know I gave first,
from a little band called...
Dishwalla.
Who?
Dishwalla! Come on!
They had that whole,
"Tell Me All Your Thoughts on God" song.
Oh...
Look, I'm not saying they're<br/>my favorite band,
but for a little while in college,
we were all into that song,<br/>and it was all thanks to me.
But I turned you on to Dishwalla.
No way! I played them on my radio show.
I mean, pirate DJ Dr. X played them on
his beloved radio show.
We all know you were Dr. X, Ted!
And I'm the one who<br/>got us into that song.
No! No! On his beloved radio show,
Dr. X pointed out that the chorus went,
"Tell me all your thoughts on God"
# 'Cause I really want to meet her. #
Her. God's a woman.
And it blew the minds
of everyone<br/>listening to Dr. X that night.
Which was pretty much<br/>everyone on campus... including me.
I'm not Dr. X.
Oh, so you're saying
credit for the stamp<br/>goes to Dr. X then, not you.
Okay... I'm gonna tell you<br/>guys something right now.
Take a sip. Follow my lead.
I'm Dr. X.
No!
I hope this works out, bro.
I couldn't even get my<br/>leg in that bratwurst outfit.
Don't be nervous. Honeywell<br/>is gonna love you.
Sweet! Freebie muff-tops!
Can I pour you a pocket of coffee?
I didn't say you were fat.
I said that dress<br/>makes you look fat! Idiot!
Hey! You must be Brad!
I'm excited to meet the man
Eriksen's been talking up all week.
Mr. Honeywell, I have to say,
your environmental work is amazing.
Come on, it's not<br/>like I'm saving the world.
Oh, wait, yes, I am!
Great.
Marshall tells me you have
the big Gruber<br/>Pharmaceutical trial coming up.
I'd love to give you<br/>my thoughts on the case,
but I can't take full credit.
Most of these are from my psychic.
My psychic always pushes<br/>for a settlement.
But my numerologist says roll<br/>the dice with the jury.
I'm waiting for my astrologist<br/>to weigh in,
but he can be kind of flaky.
You know, Cancer.
Should know more<br/>after he's back from chemo.
Good luck, bro!
You know the best part about<br/>you challenging me on Dishwalla?
- Didn't challenge you, don't care.<br/>- It made me
dig up my old video<br/>diaries from freshman year.
And somewhere in here<br/>there's gonna be proof
that I am not a piggyback stamper.
I have my own original ideas.
Didn't you only do the video diaries
because of Winona<br/>Ryder in Reality Bites?
No.
I don't know what you're<br/>talk... shut up.
Let's just watch.
How do you even know<br/>there's gonna be mention
of Dishwalla on those tapes?<br/>- I don't.
And it may take me<br/>days to go through them all,
but that is how<br/>committed I am to the truth.
Hey, you guys should check out<br/>that song by the band Dishwalla.
Really? I've never heard of them.
Damn it!
So?
A lot of
strip clubs are into my client.
If you want the Melon<br/>Patch to be in the mix,
we're gonna need bigger<br/>melons and smaller patches.
Otherwise, your<br/>establishment is not where
Barney Stinson is gonna pitch his tent.
B<br/>- Dawg, Barn Door,
Stinson-natti,<br/>Bro-hio!
Talk to me. How's it hangin'?
You are killing it at this agent thing!
I just got a big box at Yankee Stadium
from the ladies at The Big Box.
Mm-hmm.
Golden Oldies
just sent me a fax<br/>machine and a Charo calendar.
- Mm-hmm. - Aren't they<br/>out of the running?
Yeah, but those old<br/>bitches don't need to know that.
Yeah, I just feel kind of bad.
They just spent eight grand
on that wheelchair ramp up to the stage.
Hey, Larry, how's<br/>everything at the Beaver Dam?
I don't even know that strip club.
Oh, it's not a club.
My cousin Larry is a<br/>forest ranger in Squamish.
Oh, yeah?
Then I was fired from
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
for telling inappropriate jokes.
I mean...
get a sense of humor, LaShonda.
You know how "they" are.
"They" meaning Bed Bath &amp;<br/>Beyond employees, right?
Hmm?
No. Women.
That still could have been worse.
Thank God I ran into Marshall.
This guy's supportive as balls.
And here I am.
Yes, we both owe<br/>Marshall a debt of gratitude
for getting you this interview.
Eriksen...
can I see you outside? Sure.
Good. Try to stay out<br/>there a few minutes.
I just cut one, and I can tell<br/>it's gonna be a slow burn.
What is Generation X?
What does the X in "Generation<br/>X" stand for?
What do we stand for?
Why aren't people on<br/>campus talking about this?
Maybe you should do a radio show
and call yourself Dr. X.
I just had an amazing idea.
Just turn it off!
I can't look away.
Oh, God, no.
Oh, God, I'm putting on a beret.
You were there.
Why didn't you tell<br/>me that looked stupid?
Ted, that beret looks stupid.
I look magnifique!
Marshall, that man is the<br/>human equivalent of what came out
of my body after eating that<br/>soup you recommended!
This guy's your friend?
Really more of an acquaintance<br/>than a friend.
No backpedaling.
You're Marshall Eriksen.
You believe in people.
You know what Brad hasn't told you?
He was third in our class at Columbia.
That is impressive.
And I suppose he did<br/>warn us about the fart.
He's a great guy.
Please... give him just one more chance.
Two more minutes.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you for being proud of me.
You went undergrad to Holy Cross?
That's my alma mater.
I went there on a<br/>basketball scholarship.
No way. I played center.
Uh-oh.
Why is that so shocking?
'Cause you're,<br/>like, an itty-bitty fella.
Hey... fish, huh?
Fish are crazy, right?
You guys ever think about fish?
I am six-foot one, sir.
Bro, I'm at least a<br/>foot taller than you.
Well, then I guess that makes<br/>you a freakish seven-foot one.
What do you call fish with no eyes?
"Fsh".
I am six-feet and one<br/>inch, and I'll prove it.
Eriksen.
How tall are you?
Seven feet.
So, we've got a deal somewhere?
We sure do.
You are the new face of...
and exclusive customer to...
Golden Oldies!
What?
I thought we ruled them out!
I don't remember that!
Now let's go. It is 4:00,
and their dinner show<br/>starts in ten minutes.
Wait a minute.
- Oh...<br/>- Is that a Rolex?
Huh. What do you know?
How did that get there?
Anyway... so initial here and...
Where'd you get the bling, Robin?
Uh...
They bribed you.
They bribed you!
Why else would you pick a<br/>place where the strippers say
they're trying to put their<br/>grandkids through college?
Please leave!
Barney, I can explain, okay?
Please...
leave.
Say it, you giant beast!<br/>Say I'm six-one!
Maybe if you stood on<br/>top of that pot of gold
you have at the end of your rainbow.
You know something?
You're nothing but a...
a tree man!
I never want to see<br/>you again, tree man!
Fine.
I have to go to the little boys' room.
Not your office.
I need to take a dump.
If that's the type of guy you vouch for,
I can't trust your judgment.
You're off the<br/>Gruber Pharmaceutical case.
No...
Oh, good, we're up to the<br/>time I got my ear pierced.
Do it, do it, do it, do it.
Don't do it! Don't<br/>do it! Don't, don't.
Okay, do it now. Do, do, do it, do it.
Don't, don't do it! Don't<br/>do it! Don't do it!
Don't! Yes, you can do this. You can...
That goes on for 45 minutes.
Hey... how was work, baby?
Remember how I always wanted to know
what it was like to be a ghost?
Well, I don't want that anymore.
Okay, suppose we lead
with the carbon<br/>testing of the residue water.
How do we keep the<br/>jury engaged? Anyone?
You could bring up the survey from
Dr. Pasquesi's testimony.
Anyone?
Anyone who isn't dead to me?
Then you have to earn<br/>Honeywell's trust back.
Just start small.
Put your stamp on little things
that have nothing to do with work.
Like a funny video.
I... I may have something.
Don't think, Mosby! Do it now!<br/>Oh, my God, I'm doing it!
Wow, he's a real bleeder!
And then you build to<br/>something else small, like a tasty snack.
Don't sleep on the popcorn.
Try mixing the caramel and the cheese.
It shouldn't work,
but... it... does.
There's no way caramel and<br/>cheese... That's good!
That is good. Oh!
And when Honeywell starts<br/>trusting your stamp again,
he'll seek out your opinion on things.
Be honest, Eriksen.
Is this deep-V working?
And that's when you lie your ass off.
Sir...
I think you could go even deeper.
And before you know it...
Eriksen, get in here.
you're back on the case.
Ted, why are you torturing yourself?
None of us were our best in college.
Oh, my God, I love my hair there!
I always thought I was<br/>this kid from suburban Ohio
who had this innate<br/>sense of judgment and taste
and just showed up to<br/>college and wowed everyone.
Now I have concrete proof that I wasn't.
I was a total gomer.
Maybe I still am.
Wait... that's the giant suit
Marshall wore on our third date.
So...
Marshall Eriksen,
you just came back from your<br/>third date with Lily.
How was it?
Great, yeah.
I just... I think I'm<br/>falling for this girl pretty hard.
But is everything happening too fast?
I mean, maybe I should see other people.
Whoa, dude, no!
Lily Aldrin is special.<br/>You hold on to that girl.
She is.
I'm only 18 and...
Marshall, you being<br/>18 isn't a bad thing.
It just means you get to spend<br/>even more of your life with her.
I mean, I'm probably<br/>not gonna meet my wife
until I'm, like, 23.
You're right.
What am I thinking?
I'm in love with this girl.
Ted, oh, my God.
You gave me the ultimate stamp.
And in my whole life, this life...
it all goes back to that moment.
I mean, maybe take a month<br/>off, bang a couple chicks.
Lily's not going anywhere.
- Hey, Barney.<br/>- Hey.
Um, look, I'm sorry about<br/>the whole skimming-off-the-top-
of-the-strip-club-swag<br/>thing.
Hey, it happens to everybody.
Really? Because even<br/>as I said those words,
they did not feel like a real thing.
Hey, look, wherever you end<br/>up, can I have the dubious honor
of buying you your first lap dance?
It's a date.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's<br/>time for "The Decision".
Yeah.
Ladies, my bro-dium?
Yeah.
Look at this!
Man, this whole free agent experience,
it's been an unbelievable experience,
a real humbling experience.
First of all, The Lusty<br/>Leopard is where I developed my game.
Oh...
I have nothing but the<br/>utmost respect for you skanks.
He's just gonna stay<br/>at The Lusty Leopard.
They have loyalty and heart.
I bet you he rewards that.
LeBron moved on, Ted. So should you.
But Barney Stinson<br/>has to do what's right
for Barney Stinson's penis.
In this fall... This is tough.
Um...
in this fall I'm going
to take my talents to Mouth Beach.
The next day, Uncle<br/>Marshall went to court
for the biggest case of his life.
Hey, Marshall! Bilbo!
Brad? What are you...?
Did you just get hired
by Gruber Pharmaceutical's legal team?
Oh, not just.
I've been working for<br/>them for two years.
I heard about the job<br/>opening at Honeywell &amp; Cootes
and knew that if I hung<br/>out in front of your office
and pretended to be down on my<br/>luck, you'd take pity on me,
get me an interview...
Try to stay out there a few minutes.
I just cut one, and I can<br/>tell it's gonna be a slow burn.
and buy some alone<br/>time in the conference room.
I got your firm's strategy for the case.
Muchas gracias, bro-migo.
He's really more of an acquaintance<br/>than a bro-migo.
Win this case or you're fired, Eriksen.
And so began the trial<br/>that would change the course
of Marshall's career.
But we'll get to that.
Oh, you see? This is<br/>what I miss about being single:
Cutting loose at a strip club,
drinkin' some beers, seein' some boobs,
getting thrown out for<br/>being "too handsy".
You were a little out<br/>of control tonight.
You know, I really thought
that that bouncer was bluffing<br/>with the Taser.
Man, everything's gonna<br/>taste like pennies for a week.
I had a fun time tonight, though.
Me, too.
I always have fun with you.
Whoa, whoa.
I've got to...
We can't, we can't do this.
This, this can't happen.
- Uh, I've got to go.<br/>- What...?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, this a story about<br/>the time your Uncle Marshall
went before the New York State<br/>Judiciary Committee,
a panel that would decide<br/>the fate of his career.
He thought he'd open<br/>with an icebreaker.
By the way, did I mention<br/>those robes really do you all...
justice?
I'm just saying<br/>that you're all guilty...
of looking sharp.
Mr. Eriksen, please.
You're here to discuss
your conduct in court
during the week<br/>of November 19, 2012.
Of course, Your Honor.
It all
started when...
a so-called friend<br/>from law school
conned me into believing
that he needed my help<br/>getting a job,
when in reality,<br/>he stole my firm's strategy
for our upcoming trial against
Gruber Pharmaceuticals, who'd<br/>been polluting a lake upstate.
Turns out,<br/>he was representing Gruber.
Win this case<br/>or you're fired, Eriksen.
How could you trick me<br/>like that?
This is the biggest trial<br/>in my career.
Mine too, brobeans.
When I win this trial,
I'm gonna buy a new car.
Thinking Lambo.
Awesome. I mean, no!
What happened to you?
You used to be, like,<br/>the nicest guy ever.
We were bros.
More than bros.
We ate brunch together.
And I'll always cherish that.
But after Kara
broke my heart again
for the millionth time,
I said screw being nice,
suited up and started lying<br/>to get what I want.
That does happen.
But you used to want to fight<br/>for the little guy.
Little guys pay<br/>with little checks.
But... you already know that.
You're in<br/>environmental law.
Marshall, you have a kid.
How are you<br/>gonna provide
for the little dude's futche?
I'm worried<br/>about Planet Earth's futche!
That's why<br/>I'm gonna
kick your ass in this trial.
Sure, you may have swiped our<br/>entire strategy for this case,
but I still got<br/>some tricks up my sleeve
that you know<br/>absolutely nothing about.
Really?
No.

Kids, Robin and Barney<br/>had recently shared
an awkward moment.
Whoa, whoa.
After that, they did what any<br/>two mature adults would do:
Hey!
Hey!
How are you?
Great. You?
Good, so good.
Oh, great. Good to see you!<br/>You, too!
They pretended<br/>it never happened.
All right, guys,
this is the biggest case<br/>of Marshall's career.
That is why it's so great
that we all called in sick<br/>to work tomorrow,
so we could be in that<br/>courtroom to support him.
I didn't call in sick.
I called in<br/>for all of us.
Uh, I have strep throat.
Robin, bronchitis.
Barney, massive<br/>hemorrhoids.
Why'd you have<br/>to say "massive"?
Well, if you're gonna<br/>miss work for hemorrhoids,
they kind of have<br/>to be massive.
I don't want to sit<br/>in a courtroom all day.
I bet you don't want to sit<br/>anywhere with those hemorrhoids.
I don't have... Shut up.
Look, you guys<br/>wouldn't understand,
but when you have a rap sheet<br/>as long as mine,
the last place<br/>you want to spend
a day is in court.
Rap sheet?
That's right.
When I was a teenager, Lily,
I was a total badass.<br/>Pfft.
You want to talk<br/>about teenage badasses?
I was like John Gotti<br/>in a training bra.
I'm serious.
In high school, before<br/>I started dating Scooter,
even he was afraid of me.
Lily coming!
Lily coming!
You look okay.
Want to hang out?
Uh, my mom says I'm only allowed<br/>three friends, so...
Your mom don't make the rules<br/>no more, Scooter.
My name's Jeff.
Not no more it ain't.
The one part of<br/>that story I believe
is that Scooter only<br/>had three friends.
Ah!
Here he is.
The pride of St. Cloud,
the environmental lawyer
we've come<br/>to know and love.
He's mean. He's green.
He's not wearing the tie<br/>I bought him for the trial,
but I'm not gonna<br/>mention it...
Marshall "I Was Gonna<br/>Say 'Nice Tie'" Eriksen!
How you feeling,
Counselor?
Well, uh, I mean,<br/>at first
that Brad thing<br/>had me rattled,
but now I feel<br/>pretty good.
I mean, for one thing,
I don't have massive<br/>hemorrhoids. Sorry, buddy.
I don't have ma...
And more importantly,<br/>unlike Brad,
I actually have something<br/>to fight for.
Pop, because of<br/>your precedent-setting
legal victory 14 years ago,
kids like me can fish<br/>in clean lakes
all over the world.
They sure can, champ.
Because when you<br/>do one good deed...
...it creates<br/>a ripple effect.
One good deed
leads to another and another.
Man, you're wise.
That's probably why I never<br/>have felt the need to do drugs
or rebel in any way.
Anyhoo...
The next day, we all headed<br/>down to court
to support Uncle Marshall.
Yeah.
Want to know what<br/>I looked like at age 15?
There it is.
I don't get it.<br/>That guy wasn't masturbating.
Yeah, and the waistband<br/>of his undies wasn't pulled up
to his Cub Scouts neckerchief.
Ted,
you were never a badass.
Au contraire.
Off to a good start...
I was locked up
plenty of times<br/>as a teenager.
Let's just say
Johnny Law was not a fan
of Teddy Westside.
Make sure you get<br/>my good side...
Princess.
You guys want to talk
about hassling<br/>the fuzz?
Finish that, Scoots.
Okay,
let's see some IDs.
Scooter, do you<br/>smell bacon?
Laugh, bitch.
Ha!
Ha ha!
ID now, both of you.
Which one of you
is Yuki Hakutani?
Right here.
So, Yuki, you're 6'1"<br/>and you were born in 1947?
Congratulations.<br/>You can read.
Barney Stinson?
Well, if it isn't<br/>Warren Frankel.
Bailiff
Warren Frankel,
- who knows me.<br/>- You know,
I almost didn't recognize you<br/>without handcuffs on.
Yeah, I've matured quite<br/>a bit since the old days.
The only time I'm wearing<br/>handcuffs now is, uh,
in the bedroom.
Bondage. I get it.
Well,
I have to run.
Stay out of trouble.
Badass.
In summary, I will prove<br/>that Gruber Pharmaceuticals
wantonly and knowingly<br/>polluted Frog Lake
and therefore must pay<br/>restitution of no less
than $25 million.
Thank you.
How's this for a fact:
Frog Lake is home
to a buttload of frogs<br/>and birds.
If it's so polluted,
why don't all those birds fly<br/>to a cleaner lake?
And why don't the frogs<br/>just be like,
"Hey, birds, can I catch<br/>a ride, ribbit?"
Marshall's gonna wipe<br/>the floor with this ding-dong.
Oops.
I seem to have dropped my pen.
Objection, Your Honor.
Nobody needs this long<br/>to pick up a pen.
I'll allow it.
The biggest case of my life<br/>and I'd already lost the jury.
I mean,
I've heard of Twelve Angry Men,
but this was more<br/>like Twelve Horny Women.
Stay on topic.
I can't compete<br/>with Brad.
The jury is<br/>in love with him.
During recess, one of those<br/>ladies raced across the hall
to see if she could<br/>get a divorce.
And I'm pretty sure<br/>there was some funny business
going on under<br/>that judge's robe.
What you guys saw<br/>Brad do was nothing.
He's taken it to a<br/>whole other level.
Ladies and...
ladies of the jury,
I'm sorry if I seem down.
My girlfriend
Kara...
broke up with me last night.
Aww...
She said I listen too much,
whatever that means.
- Aww...<br/>- Aww...
Can you believe this guy?
Really?
Do I even want to see<br/>what I look like?
Wow.
That's, like, super mean.
Next, Brad brought out<br/>his "expert witness."
So, Dr. Bedrosian,<br/>you're saying
that even if Gruber<br/>Pharmaceuticals'
industry-leading drugs<br/>somehow seeped into Frog Lake,
they could actually be<br/>helping the otter population
grow thicker coats of fur?
Absolutely.
And for the older<br/>birds, who...
maybe don't perform as well<br/>in the bedroom as they used to,
could actually<br/>be having
healthier sex lives?
In my expert opinion...
yes...?
Yes.
So Gruber...
is giving these animals<br/>free medicine.
Medicine that you or I would<br/>have to pay a fortune for if...
we needed help<br/>in the bedroom...
which I don't.
You're so bad.
But I realized,
if Brad could call a quack<br/>as his star witness,
then so could I.
You'll get that in a second.
Meet Paddles,
the duckling.
"Quack."
Continue.
Little Paddles here just spent
three months being nursed<br/>back to health.
Why?
Well, because he was found<br/>in Frog Lake
suffering<br/>from acute dermatitis...
...a painful full-body rash,<br/>caused by who?
Gruber Pharmaceuticals.
For a brief, shining moment,
it looked like I might<br/>just win this thing.
But then...
I took a field trip to this<br/>so-called "polluted" lake.
If you'll indulge me,
I'd like to share my experience.
Frog Lake.
Behold...
nature's beauty.
Polluted?
Polluted with good times.
♪
Frog... Lake.

Frog Lake.
Come on in.
The water's fine.
I shot and edited that myself.
Yep, I edit stuff, too.
Sorry, Ms. Aldrin, there's no<br/>rap sheet under your name.
Oh, y-you know what,<br/>it must be under
my street tag: Number One Gunna.
Nope. Sorry,<br/>Number One Gunna.
Next!
Those jive-ass turkeys<br/>must've lost it.
Well, they're<br/>pretty swamped
arresting 1970s pimps<br/>like yourself.
Lily, let it go.
I didn't want to brag,<br/>but I think
it's time to acknowledge
that I was the ultimate<br/>teenage badass of this group.
You were a teen<br/>pop star in Canada.
You sang songs about the mall.<br/>Hey.
There is a dark side<br/>to being a rocker on the road
north of the 49th.
Mm, thanks.
Hey.
We've received<br/>some noise complaints, eh?
Can you please lower the music?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
Sure.
How aboot, uh,<br/>I lower the TV, too,
yeah?
Three hours later,<br/>I was arrested
drunk, naked,<br/>and driving a Zamboni.
Man, that DUI drove my insurance<br/>through the roof.
Please be seated.
Mr. Morris,<br/>good seeing you this morning.
Mr. Eriksen...
you're here.
Any, uh,
final witnesses?
Well, Your Honor, um...
Um...
Actually, Your Honor,<br/>uh, I'm afraid...
Mr. Eriksen?
Your Honor,<br/>I call Brad Morris
to the stand.
Mr. Eriksen, this is
highly irregular.<br/>I would like
Mr. Morris to remove his shirt.
I'll allow it.<br/>Objection, Your Honor,
on grounds that this is ridonk!
Overruled. Take it off.
Acute...
dermatitis,
courtesy of Frog Lake
and Gruber<br/>Pharmaceuticals.
That was badass.
So, in the end,
one might say you were forced<br/>to do something...
rash?
Rash!
You know, I had that o,<br/>but Lily told me to cut it.
Um, anyway...
all that was left<br/>was the verdict.
"We, the jury,<br/>find Gruber Pharmaceuticals...
guilty."
Yes!
$25 million.
That tie is not only<br/>tasteful; it's lucky!
I hereby fine Gruber<br/>in the amount of $25,000.
Court is adjourned.
Your Honor, $25,000?<br/>What just happened?
Son, yes, Gruber Pharmaceuticals<br/>probably polluted that lake,
but I'm not gonna ruin<br/>an important company
just because they gave<br/>some bird a rash.
No, but it's thousands of birds,
and fish and otters and turtles...<br/>Look, Eriksen,
I hate to cut you short,
but I got tickets to Annie<br/>and my wife is waiting.
You have a wi...
won-wonderful show to see?
Guilty. Ciao.
You'd best get<br/>your mind right, son!
The game is the game,<br/>and there ain't no winners.
How many retired<br/>gangbangers you know?
Exactly.
Barney...
check it out.
I found my scrapbook<br/>from the old days.
We're kind of busy<br/>right now, Warren.
We're scaring kids<br/>straight, so...
No, no.<br/>Barney was
the youngest member<br/>of our Magic Enthusiasts Club
years back.
Famous for
escaping from handcuffs.
Handcuffs, huh?
Very tiny hands.
That was his secret.
See you around, baby hands.
So, you don't know the bailiff<br/>because you were a badass.
You knew him because you guys<br/>were in a nerd club together.
Where you dazzled audiences<br/>with your sleight-of-tiny-hand.
So I was a late hand bloomer!
Go ahead, laugh,
laugh like all the others,
but those magicians pulled off<br/>the greatest trick of all:
they accepted me.
Okay, well,<br/>to be fair,
I... may have<br/>slightly exaggerated
my badass story, too.
Oh, sorry. Uh, no,<br/>thank you, housekeeping.
I've already made my bed.
And I only used<br/>one washcloth, so it's...
Congratulations,<br/>Miss Sparkles.
On behalf
of the Manitoba Hotel
and Curling Rink Association,<br/>we'd like to thank you
for being the nicest, most<br/>well-behaved hotel guest ever.
Oh, yippee!
What a loser!
Your story's not true,<br/>either, is it, Ted?
Not at all.
Make sure you get<br/>my good side, Princess!
I left the courthouse that day
questioning what<br/>I was even doing with my life...
and then that night,<br/>I had a dream.
Sorry I failed, son.
What about your<br/>Pebble Theory, Dad?
One good deed ripples out<br/>and makes another and another?
Yeah.
This is what really happens
when you throw a pebble<br/>into Frog Lake.
The truth is,<br/>you can fight
your whole life to do good<br/>and still get nowhere.
You're wrong.
Some good's gonna ripple<br/>out of this, Dad.
I promise.
Great, I've angered<br/>the Frog King.
Later that night,<br/>some good did ripple out.
Hey.
What, are you<br/>here to gloat?
No. Came here to thank you.
For reminding me
of why I got into law<br/>in the first place:
to fight for the little guy.
Which is why
I said "Hasta Lucia" to my firm,
and took a job<br/>at your firm, brobeans.
Don't "brobeans" me.
My boss would never hire you<br/>after the way you lied to us.
I told him I'd take every<br/>last bit of manipulation,
deception, and accidental<br/>pen-dropping
I used against you guys and<br/>put it towards saving the world.
Even if that's true,
I'm still not sure<br/>that I can forgive you.
Would you object to<br/>an 11:15 brunch rezzy for two
tomorrow at the Popover Pantry?
I'll allow it.
Yes! The Brunch Bros are back!
And thank God we were,<br/>because...
well, what he said next
is the reason that<br/>I'm sitting in this chair.
Seriously,
thanks-- for giving my soul<br/>a little redempsh.
And B-T-dubs,<br/>that judge was an idiot.
It's people<br/>like you,
people with hope<br/>and vision and integ,
that should be behind that bench<br/>making the calls.
And that's when I realized<br/>I wanted to be a judge.
Because judges
are the ones who<br/>can effect real change.
And that's why I'm here,
before the New York State<br/>Judiciary Committee.
I hope that you will consider me
for an appointment<br/>to a judgeship.
Thank you,<br/>Mr. Eriksen.
The panel will take this<br/>under advisement.
Take your time.
It could be a few months.
Better tell my wife<br/>I won't be home for dinner.
Get out.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you?<br/>Uh, great. You?
So gr...
Can we talk about this<br/>for a second?
Yeah.
It is super-weird between us,<br/>and I don't want it to be.
Me, neither.
So let me just say this.
I'm done.
You don't have<br/>to worry anymore.
What do you mean?
I'm done trying to get you.
I can't do it anymore.
I'm sorry it's taken me<br/>this long to figure it out,
but I promise...
I'm done making<br/>a fool of myself.
Barney, you haven't been making<br/>a fool out of yourself...
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want it to be okay.
So here's what's<br/>gonna happen.
I'm gonna get us two drinks,
come back and comment<br/>on the likely size and color
of the nipples<br/>on that redhead at the bar,
with the big, dark nipples.
And you're gonna<br/>be grossed out,
but you're gonna laugh<br/>a little anyway, and then you'll tell
a funny story about<br/>"that bitch Patrice" at work,
but neither one of us<br/>are gonna say,
"Hey, how's it going?"<br/>or "Good to see you!"
Because it really will be<br/>good to see you.
Think we can swing that?
Yeah, I do.
Badass.
Huh.
Thanks for your support, guys.<br/>It means a lot.
We'll call in sick anytime<br/>you have a problem.
Lily coming!
Lily coming!
Badass.

[<div class="full-script">Well, it's come to this-- we're<br/>drinking with our baby in a bar.
It is not a bar.
It's a restaurant that<br/>happens to have a bar.
Ergo, we are good parents.
Unrelated: I'm getting<br/>faced right now.
Papa needs a grease coat.
While it is<br/>heartwarming to watch
your firstborn teethe<br/>on a jalapeA?o popper,

I'm meeting<br/>with a headhunter
next week to line up
my next project,<br/>but until then, what the hell?
Ted, although a "what<br/>the hell" attitude is
incredibly sought<br/>after in a babysitter,
I think that Lily<br/>and Marshall...
You're hired.
Now that we've been
parents for awhile,<br/>we realize
that pretty much any moron<br/>can take care of a baby.
Thank you.
Mine!
Ow.
Delicious and mine.
They do look yummy<br/>yum-yum, mister.
No. No!
What have I done?!

Clear!
I'm going in.
Oh, my...
Damn it, guys,<br/>we lost him.
And he was so close<br/>to retirement.
Just this morning<br/>he said to me,
"I'm getting too old<br/>for this shirt."
I know, dude.
Oh, my God.
You are such<br/>a good folder.
That's, like, The Gap good.
Robin...
...let's go hit the bar.
At this restaurant.
I think they have a bar here.
Okay, what was that?<br/>What was what?
The "dumb cheerleader flirting<br/>with the quarterback" thing.
You looked like<br/>you were gonna
chase Barney down with
a sixer of watermelon<br/>wine coolers.
First of all, those bad girls<br/>come in fourskis.
And second, why would I<br/>be flirting with Barney?
I'm not interested in him,<br/>and I made that very clear.
With something that I did.
Recently.
Just spill it.
The other week,<br/>Barney made a move,
but I turned him down.
I felt awful for closing<br/>the door in his face,
but he realized I was right.
I'm done trying to get you.
I can't do it anymore.
And now I get it.<br/>Get what?
You may have closed the door<br/>on Barney, but he locked it.
What? No, he didn't.
Yeah, he got the last word,
and now you want
what you can't have,<br/>like you always do.
It's the classic<br/>lobster situation.
I'm afraid<br/>you're allergic to lobster.
You can never, ever, ever<br/>have it.
Oh, this... is... delicious.
Once you learned<br/>you couldn't have lobster,
you became obsessed.
Barney's the same thing.
And this is gonna<br/>blow up in your face,
just like the lobster<br/>blew up your face.
Wrong.<br/>This is nothing like lobster.
Okay.
Just remember, you can never<br/>hook up with Barney again.
That's fine.<br/>Never.
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Oh, no.
Marshall, Lily and<br/>Ted can't make it,
for viable reasons<br/>I just learned
via this text message<br/>I accidentally deleted.
Guess it's just gonna be<br/>you and me.
Fine by me.
Me, too. Totally.
Supafine.
Hey there, Scherbats,<br/>your voice of reason here.
What you doing?
I hope you don't mind,
but I was hungry, so I ordered<br/>MacLaren's new special.
I couldn't eat lunch at work<br/>because they ordered
Thai food.
I miss you, Cornelius!
Oh, my God.
You're so sensitive.
And deep.
No. You're better than this.
Barney is not like lobster.
Okay, that's unfortunate,<br/>but it doesn't mean
you have to hook up<br/>with Barney.
Whoa!
God, you said that out loud!
No, I didn't.
How would you know?<br/>You're out of control.
Oh, you think you're so smart,<br/>don't you, bitch?
Um, billion-dollar idea alert.
Why should bibs<br/>only be socially acceptable
when you're eating lobster?
If we could wear them<br/>all the time,
then Corny would still be
with us right now.
I miss...
Picture a bib<br/>that looks like your suit:
a collar, a tie, a jacket.
Mm-hmm.
Atta girl. Keep it cool.
I could call them Brobibs!
That's interesting.
Yeah, you got this.
I'm sorry I called you a bitch.
What do you think?
Oh, that idea's amazeballs!
That's it. I'm out of here.
I'm out of control.
I came this close
to telling Barney<br/>that I wanted him.
Robin, as your friend,<br/>I got to be honest.
I think this Brobibs thing<br/>is a frickin' gold mine.
What? No.
Lily, I really need advice.
Okay.
Invest now.
Seriously, it's like Apple<br/>at ten dollars a share.
Lily, please.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm just,<br/>I'm a little distracted.
I-I got to get upstairs
and check on<br/>Ted and Marvin.
Can we please just talk about<br/>this Brobib thing another time?
How was your day?
Good, although I think<br/>I just saw a woman
with a full beard outside.
Marvin crawled!
What?
He's never done that before.
I know!
I think I just saw a guy<br/>with breasts outside.
Marvin crawled.
I can't believe it.<br/>Believe it.
I took a video for you.
You're doing it, Marvin.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Oh!
Your Uncle Ted is so proud.
Whoops.
Guess I had the camera flipped.
I use it to<br/>check my teeth for debris.
Ooh, sounds like<br/>somebody's "crawling" me.
Oh, sweetie, oh, come on.
Lil, listen, so we missed<br/>the first time he crawled.
So what?
We'll see it the<br/>next time, I promise.
Oh, my God,<br/>he just did it again!
Guys, get in here!<br/>Marvin can't stop crawling!
He's Holden Crawl-field!
Get in here right now--<br/>nope, nope, it's over.
Okay, hey, I know.
Baby, I know, I know.
But, listen, there will be<br/>plenty of other Marvin firsts.
His first day<br/>at school,
his first trip to meet Santa,
his first<br/>touchdown pass for
the 2032 Super Bowl champion<br/>Vikings-- no pressure.
I'll love him even if he runs<br/>the ball into the end zone.
So can we please just let<br/>this crawling thing go?
Yeah, okay. You're right.
I mean, I'm being nuts.
We'll see it when we see it.
Yeah.
Do it.
If you ever want to<br/>see these boobs again,
crawl, you son of a me.
Come on, Lil.
You know what they say:<br/>a watched tot never crawls.
Or calls you later in life,
after it sees<br/>this disturbing footage.
Hey, Lily, Marshall.
Uh, Lily, we need to talk.
Oh, that sounds serious!
Oh, you guys should<br/>talk about it
down at the bar<br/>until after Marvin's asleep.
And if you want to<br/>stay down there until
after SportsCenter's over,<br/>that's fine, too.
Ooh.
Keep shooting.
If you miss it,<br/>I'm leaving you.
Yeah, that seems<br/>about right.
Sorry if I'm<br/>bad company.
I'm not sure anything is gonna
take my mind off of missing<br/>Marvin's first crawl.
Lily, I've had a revelation.
Brobibs for women.
Bitchbibs!
You know Barney's gonna sue us,
but damn it,<br/>let's just go for it.
No, Lily, this is serious.
When that doctor told me<br/>I couldn't eat lobster
and I did it anyway,<br/>it almost killed me.
But here's the thing:
I never wanted lobster again.
So the solution is obvious.
The only way to get<br/>Barney out of my system
is to get him into my system,<br/>one last time.
It's brilliant, right?
Not brilliant at all.
Thanks for being on board.<br/>Not on board.
It means a lot.<br/>Big mistake.
You're my girl.
Now it's just a question<br/>of how to get him...
Hey, Robin,<br/>I just got your text.
What's the big emergency?
Hi, Barney!
You seem like you run fast.
Do you want me to fan you<br/>with my US magazine?
He's fine.<br/>Thanks, Patrice.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
I just got this<br/>new printer,
and I need somebody<br/>big and strong
to take it to my office for me.
I promise to repay you.
We'll do it<br/>for you, Robin!
Don't you have a late-breaking<br/>weather story to cover, Brandi?
Oh, I did it already.
It rained.
Oh, I got to jump on
a big Brobibs<br/>conference call.
The lawyer from Dude Aprons<br/>is really busting my balls.
See ya.
Nobody asked<br/>for your help, Patrice!
You either, Brandi!
Stop it.
Hey, hey.
What are you guys doing<br/>slobbering all over my friend?
Oh, Barney, don't be jealous.
If you're gonna drool,<br/>do it in style!
We've got every look<br/>in the book.
The Business Casual.
The Preppy.
The Robin Williams.
Bib up!
Brobibs is in no way<br/>affiliated with,
inspired by or derivative of<br/>Dude Aprons.
Hey, there.
Hey!
It is so good to see you.
Thanks, Robin.
This game affects my<br/>league score.
Look, I don't agree<br/>with your lobster quest,
but I can't stand watching you<br/>make a fool of yourself.
You want the fix?<br/>I got the fix.
Back in college...
it was love at first sight<br/>for me and Marshall,
but when it came to making<br/>the first move, well,
he needed help.
So I took matters<br/>into my own hands.
aTS
Let's get<br/>out of here.
You just need a girl<br/>who, I don't know,
gets a few drinks in her<br/>and wants to have fun
and put on a show.<br/>Mm-hmm.
And it drives guys crazy,<br/>'cause you both
don't even care.
It's just stupid and fun.
Lily, that sounds perfect.<br/>Thank you.
Mm. Just stupid.
Stupid and fun.
Who the hell is that?
Hey, guys.
Barney, this is Brandi,<br/>my fun friend from work,
who just doesn't even care.
Hello, Brandi.
Congratulations on the gig.
Aw, thank you!
World Wide News is<br/>an amazing place to work.
Not that gig, sweetheart.
Marshall!
What? Ow.
It's late.
I'm so tipsy.
It is late.<br/>We should get out of here.
So, Brandi, ever sneak<br/>into the studio
and do it in front of<br/>the weather map?
No. Why do you ask?
No reason.
Someone is about to get<br/>unseasonably banged.
Damn it!
What did I do wrong?
Nothing. It was awesome.<br/>Oh, Marshall, let's go!
Hey.<br/>Hey, Lilypad!
So, don't be upset.
Ted...
took Marvin shopping
and sort of bought him...
all his winter clothes.
Get ready
for our star runway model--
or should I say,<br/>our star crawlway model.
He's doing it again, guys!<br/>Get in here!
N-No-no, it's over.
That's it. Ted's fired.
Fired? No, c-come on, Lily,<br/>he's helping us out.
Plus, next week,<br/>your dad'll be back,
and Ted has the meeting<br/>with that headhunter.
Let's just stay cool.
Starting at quarterback,
the pride of Cleveland...
Marvin Eriksen!<br/>Right?
Right, guys? He's gonna be<br/>a little Browns fan.
Oh, by the way, I cancelled that<br/>meeting with the headhunter,
so I can take care<br/>of Marvin next week.
What? No, no, my dad'll<br/>be better by then.
Oh, I gave Mickey the month off.
It's supposed to snow, and, uh,<br/>Uncle Ted doesn't want to miss
Marvin's first sleigh ride.
You're fired.<br/>You're fired.
Marvin has a bib with little...<br/>little dinosaurs on it.
Maybe you should<br/>make one like that.
Brobibs are for grown men<br/>wearing bibs, Ted.
I don't want them<br/>looking like idiots.
Lily, Marshall, you know you<br/>can't keep him away from me.
He's gonna start<br/>asking questions.
Calm down, Ted.
We-we just wanted<br/>to apologize.
We overreacted before.
Mm-hmm.
Meet us
at the swim class you<br/>apparently signed Marvin up for.
Bubble Buddies?<br/>I'd love t...
I mean, I'll have<br/>to check my skedge.
Sorry. When I'm excited,
I abbreviate words I shouldn't.
Come on, Ted,
what do you say?
Fab. Perf.
Sorry.
See you at B-Buds.
Bubble Buddies. Sorry.
Augie. Jayden.
Dylan. Girl Dylan.
Hey, Ted.<br/>Hey. Where's Marvin?
Does Coach Amber have him<br/>warming up in the Jacooz?
Sorry again.
Aw, hey, buddy, listen,<br/>we wanted to talk to you
about how you've kind of been<br/>overdoing it with Marvin.
I haven't been overdoing it.
Ted, we're in<br/>a baby swim class,
and clearly you've<br/>done something extreme
to get the naming rights<br/>to that lollipop bin.
But I-I think that we've
figured out what's<br/>going on with you.
See, after we<br/>let you go...
What is this?
Marvin's Book of Firsts?
Ted took Marvin<br/>to see Santa?!
Oh, I am gonna<br/>take this book
and I'm gonna shove it<br/>so far up his...
The point is,<br/>it made us remember
another scrapbook you made.
That project really<br/>was your baby,
and now it's over, and<br/>you're scared to move on.
I poured my blood, sweat<br/>and tears into that building.
Though, to be fair,<br/>a lot of that happened
the day I accidentally fell<br/>down the elevator shaft.
Mm.
The point is,
it's just really hard to let go.
Especially when that building's<br/>my biggest accomplishment.
I mean,
maybe if I was where<br/>you guys are at in life,
with all you have<br/>to be proud of...
We get it, okay?
You're always gonna be<br/>Uncle Ted.
But if Marvin
can't be your next project,
you need one of your own,
and so we rescheduled<br/>your meeting with that headhunter.
He's over there.
Which one is he?
Thanks, guys.
Marvin and I are lucky<br/>you're our parents.
Aw.
Oh, hey, Ted?
It's kind of a big,<br/>professional meeting--
you might want to trade out<br/>that lollipop
for a shirt.<br/>Yeah.
I'll just give it to one of these kids.<br/>Oh, buddy.
What?<br/>You're half naked,
you're not a parent to<br/>any of these children--
don't offer 'em candy.
I can't believe Barney<br/>went home with Brandi.
I should have asked you<br/>to do that play with me.
Well, it's too late now,<br/>isn't it?
There he is. Straddle me.<br/>Start grinding.
Nothing's off-limits.
So, last night
Brandi and I got<br/>to the WWN studios,
and my high-pressure system
was ready to slam<br/>into her warm front.
The studio's unlocked,
the weather map's up--
ready to do it in 17<br/>different states at once?
Um, actually...
I don't think I want that.
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm...
I'm gonna go.
Wait, you didn't<br/>sleep with her?
Nope.
I spent the night<br/>thinking about
how everything I've done<br/>since Quinn and I broke up
has been a cry for help.
Dressing a dog up like me,
hooking up with<br/>all those nannies...
Brobibs?<br/>No, those are solid.
I still want in.
And I realized that...<br/>I'm searching,
searching for what<br/>I really want in life,
and you know what?
I have absolutely<br/>no idea what that is.
Wow.
Barney...<br/>But...
I'm going<br/>to figure it out.
I have to.
Good night, guys.
God, I feel awful.
Barney is
going through something big,
and I've been obsessing<br/>about one stupid final hookup
to get him out of my system.
He needs space...
and time to figure things out.
And I have to give it to him.
Robin? What are you doing here?<br/>It's okay
if you don't know<br/>what you want in life...
...as long as you know<br/>what you want...
tonight.
Well...
I do know what I want.
Hi, Robin!
Nobody asked you<br/>here, Patrice!
Actually, I did.
Last night.
Let me go see if<br/>the studio's open.
All right.
Oh, hi, Barney.
I'm working late.
What are you doing here?
I'm...
I don't know what<br/>I'm doing... here.
Barney... I don't know<br/>you that well, but...
are you okay?
Yeah. What do you mean?
Well, whenever I see<br/>someone unhappy,
I get the urge<br/>to give them cookies,
and I really want<br/>to give you cookies right now.
Cookie?
Lame. No, thanks.
You sure?<br/>They're heart-shaped.
Sorry, a couple<br/>of them are broken.
I know how they feel.<br/>I'd love one.
After that,<br/>I sent Brandi packing,
and Patrice and I<br/>talked all night.
We're...
kind of on a<br/>date right now.
But if you'd like<br/>to throw on some clothes
and join us for Crazy Eights...
I can deal you in!
My deck has puppies on it!
Arf-arf!
Um...
I...
got to go.
Look, I still feel bad<br/>I went too far
with all the Marvin firsts--<br/>the Santa thing, especially.
I mean,<br/>I should've known.
Are you sure<br/>you guys forgive me?
Absolutely.<br/>Don't worry, no grudges.
Great.<br/>Next round's on me.
Coming, honey!
Okay, you guys have<br/>all the numbers-- my cell,
the restaurant,<br/>Center for Disease Control?
She's with her Aunt Lily<br/>and Uncle Marshall.
Nothing's gonna happen.
You're right.
You're totally right.
Okay...
Bye, sweetie.
Here, you...
Mm...
Get out of here, ya crazy.<br/>Would you get out of here already.
Who's ready to meet Santa?

MARSHALL: Who's "he"?!
He's coming!<br/>Everyone shut up!
NARRATOR: Okay, kids, you're probably<br/>wondering how
we all got here.
Oh, hey, buddy, can<br/>we borrow your air mattress?
My mom's coming into<br/>town for a few days.
Absolutely not.
Bummer, I guess<br/>she can't stay with us.
Hey, look,<br/>what I just found.
A list of hotels and other<br/>creative housing options.
Baby, my mom is not<br/>staying at a hotel.
Or our storage unit.
Why can't we borrow<br/>your air mattress?
Because when you animals<br/>borrow things,
you never return them.
That's ridiculous.
No, my Cleveland, Ohio,<br/>Chamber of Commerce
mini-cooler<br/>is ridiculous.
Ridiculous at keeping<br/>stuff cold
while also promoting Ohio's<br/>second-largest rubber producer.
Watch your back, Akron.
I totally gave that back.
And what about that<br/>"Vote For Ted" hoodie
from when I ran for treasurer<br/>in high school?
Mrs. Gooding said
my concession speech was,<br/>"full of grace."
I don't recall<br/>borrowing that.
And whatever happened<br/>to my limited edition DVD
of the classic 1989<br/>Silverman-McCarthy romp,
Weekend at Bernie's,<br/>"borrowed" well over six months ago?
Yeah, I'm<br/>keeping that.
Those extra features<br/>are awesome.
I mean, that making-of<br/>documentary?
"How Bernie Avoided The Gurney:<br/>A Cinematic Journey."
Look, I'm just tired<br/>of people borrowing things
and never returning them.
If you don't believe me,<br/>ask my ex-friend Stuart.
Ted, I gave your red<br/>cowboy boots back
the day after Halloween.
How could you lie to me<br/>right to my face, Stuart?
You are a horrible<br/>human being.
Congrats on<br/>your daughter's christening.
And where's the worst abuser<br/>of my generosity, Barney?
Or should I say,<br/>"Borrow-ney"?
You should<br/>never say that.
And I think he's out<br/>with Patrice.
Uch, Patrice?<br/>That's still happening?
NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, you remember Patrice.
She worked<br/>with your Aunt Robin.
Robin! You left your purse<br/>at the vending machine,
and some guy tried<br/>to steal it!
I fought him off, but I think<br/>I dislocated my shoulder.
You scratched the leather! Oh!
Can't you do anything right,<br/>Patrice?!
That Barney-and-Patrice<br/>thing is so bogus.
He's clearly trying<br/>to get back at me
for rejecting him.
Um, Robin, after you<br/>rejected Barney,
didn't he reject you?
And didn't you go
over to his place and<br/>try to sleep with him
in your purple-and-<br/>black underwear?
Hey, uh, Lil, feel free<br/>to disregard that
"Don't tell anyone<br/>about this ever" thing.
She has your<br/>mini-cooler.
I knew it!
But seriously,<br/>what other reason would
Barney have to<br/>date Patrice?
It's an over-correction.
How dare you?!<br/>What is that?!
Barney was engaged to Quinn,<br/>a stripper he never really trusted.
So he overcorrects<br/>by dating her opposite:
warm and nurturing<br/>Patrice.
LILY: That does happen,<br/>like Ted.
After you broke up<br/>with sweet innocent Victoria.
No, you hang up first.
No, you hang up first.
No, you hang up first.
Hang up,<br/>you little bitch!
Over-correction.
Yeah. And it's not just<br/>relationships.
Remember when that<br/>comedy club owner told Marshall
that his "funny fish names"<br/>stand-up act
didn't have enough edge?
Flounder?<br/>I barely know her! Oh!
Over-correction.
Although it was better<br/>than his Chris Rock rip-off.
A trout with a daughter<br/>has one job.
One job!
To keep her off<br/>the fishing pole!
LILY:<br/>You suck!
Lily!
♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x10 ♪<br/>The Over-Correction<br/>Original Air Date on December 10, 2012
I'm a little worried<br/>about Ted.
I mean, we're parents now,<br/>and even Barney is moving on.
I just wish he had<br/>someone to talk to.
Even for a week.
Or you know, four days,<br/>three nights.
My mom is not staying<br/>with Ted!
He'd love her bacon-<br/>gummy bear pancakes.
I'm her special boy,<br/>I get her special pancakes.
But my dad is here<br/>nannying all the time.
Then add your mom in?
This place is crowded<br/>enough already.
(knocking)<br/>MICKEY: Hey, Lil,
let me know<br/>how the pump's working.
I cleaned it for you.
It's fine, Dad.<br/>Yeah, I had
to check the suction,<br/>so I tested it on myself.
Oh, no.
Don't worry, the suction's fine,
actually kind of nice.
Okay, Barney is so not<br/>for real about Patrice.
Today he did the craziest,
most clearly staged<br/>for my benefit thing ever.
Hey, Patrice,<br/>you ready for lunch?
Sure.
(scoffs)
Right, right?
I mean,
what's next, birthday gifts?
Wake up, people, this is<br/>not an overcorrection,
it's fraud, and we need
to keep trying<br/>to stop this.
What do you mean,<br/>"keep trying"?
Barney is not<br/>who you think he is.
What do you mean?
Well, he has a book<br/>of plays he uses
to trick women<br/>into sleeping with him.
Oh, no way,<br/>Barney's my honey bear.
Actually, one of his plays<br/>is called The Honey Bear.
He dresses up<br/>like Winnie the Pooh,
and the next thing you know,<br/>his hand's stuck in your pot.
Robin, you're a doll<br/>for worrying about me,
but that doesn't sound at all<br/>like my Barney.
Why won't you let me<br/>help you, Patrice?!
She can't see<br/>that Barney is using her,
and it breaks my heart.
You know, I-I-I<br/>love Patrice.
We're like sisters.
You've never gotten<br/>through even one exchange
without screaming at her.
Sisters fight, Ted!
But the bond
is always there.
Okay?<br/>Okay.
And that's<br/>why I need
to steal The Playbook<br/>and show it to Patrice,
so she'll believe me.
Or you could do<br/>almost anything else
and not sound<br/>so creepy.
TED:<br/>Robin,
seriously, this obsession<br/>isn't healthy.
Just let it go.
(sighs)
Maybe you guys are right.
(sighs)
Thanks for talking<br/>some sense into me.
(whirring)
Lily, can I ask you
a question?
If it's "Did somebody put gravel
in the couch cushions<br/>you're sleeping on,"
absolutely not.
What would be the motive?
No, it's not that.
Uh, don't tell Marshall<br/>because he's not ready,
but I think I might want
to get back out there<br/>and meet a nice man.
Wow, that's great, Judy.
And I thought<br/>you might be able to help
because you always look<br/>so good.
You think I look good?
I mean, you dress<br/>like a Duluth streetwalker,
but my son seems to like it.
I'll take it.
So, any advice?
Well, first I'd throw out<br/>any giant sweater
with a horse on it.
Even the ones...?<br/>Even the ones
that have manes<br/>with real horse hair, yes.
And second, I'd let the gals<br/>out to play a little more.
The gals?
Oh...
you mean the Minnesota Twins.
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Robin was<br/>about to give up
on ever finding The Playbook<br/>until...
(beeps, hisses)
(choir singing)
Ugh, the Bro Code, damn it.
(beeps, hisses)
(sighs)
(hissing)
(choir singing)
David Lee Roth's autobiography?
Crap.
(sighs)
"To the best wingman ever.
"We'll always have Panama.
Love, Diamond Dave."
(hissing)
Patrice, it's really nice of you<br/>to buy Robin a new purse,
but it's not your fault that<br/>the other one got scratched.
Anyway, just get<br/>yourself over here.
I've got the tree,<br/>the decorations,
and the know-how<br/>from Lethal Weapon 2
to pop that shoulder<br/>right back into place.
Yep, there is not one reason<br/>to leave this apartment
for even a second tonight.
Ow.
How's my favorite architect?<br/>Other than incredibly handsome.
Hey, Mom.
No, it's Robin.
What do you need?
For reasons<br/>that aren't important,
I'm trapped in Barney's closet.
Help get me out, and I'll return<br/>your Weekend at Bernie's DVD.
No way, that's not enough to get<br/>me involved in your crazy mess.
I'll also go with you
to the five-day fan convention<br/>in the desert.
You'll come with me<br/>to Bernie Man?
Yes, just hurry.
JUDY (over baby monitor):<br/>Ooh...
someone's excited to see me.
Who's Mama's big boy?
Who is Mama's big boy?
Wait.
MICKEY:<br/>I am.
Mickey?
And I've been bad.
Get off my mommy.
(knocking)
Hugh Hefner<br/>in your lobby right now.
I'm gonna grab my robe.
"Teddy's first Christmas"?
Barney, are these my ornaments?
That could be anyone's<br/>baby handprint, Ted.
Now, come on, Hef's old,<br/>but he moves like a cheetah.
(sighing)
(hissing)
(choir singing)
(gasping)
Why would you do that...
with Mickey?
I've been lonely,<br/>Marshall, and all the men
in St. Cloud's idea of romance<br/>is taking me ice fishing.
That was me and<br/>your father's thing.
Plus,
call it an overcorrection,<br/>but it's kind of nice
being with a sophisticated,<br/>big-city man.
(belches)
You know, I don't know<br/>what the big deal is.
You've been bumping uglies<br/>with my daughter for years.
The second I climb up on your<br/>mom, it's the end of the world?
(groans)
How could you think<br/>that was Hef?
It was<br/>an honest mistake.
That guy was black, Ted.
I guess I just don't notice<br/>that kind of stuff.
(hissing)
(exclaims)
(sighs)
We'll get to the grotto<br/>one day, my pet.
One day.
How's my favorite architect?
Other than well-endowed.
Mom?
No, it's Robin again.
Look, you've got to come<br/>back in and get my purse.
Nope, I'm done. Bye, Robin.
Wait!
What if I told you<br/>I was looking at
your red cowboy boots right now?
Describe them.
They're red<br/>and they're cowboy boots.
That's them!
Why are they at Barney's?
Hey, Barney.
Just returning Ted's boots<br/>I borrowed for Halloween.
You were a cowboy?
No, my wife<br/>was Wonder Woman.
Can you believe Ted thinks a guy<br/>can get laid wearing these?
Challenge accepted.
Do you know what<br/>that sound is, Ted?
That's a red boot
about to be savagely<br/>cut up by my pocketknife!
You mean my pocketknife.
I lent it to you two years ago.
(knocking)
Hey.
Sorry about the<br/>Hugh Hefner mix-up.
But seriously,<br/>Jon Bon Jovi is downstairs.
You sure it isn't my landlady,<br/>Mrs. Takahashi?
I'm serious.
The janitor just<br/>mopped the floor.
Bon Jovi is literally<br/>standing next to a sign
that says "Slippery When Wet."
Uh-uh.<br/>I want those ornaments back.
(cell phone buzzes)
(knocking at door)
Damn it, Ted!
You get those ornaments<br/>all year.
I just need<br/>'em for Christmas!
Oh. Hey, Patrice.
Did you have any<br/>trouble finding Rudolph?
No, it was right on Ted's<br/>fire escape like you said.
Are you sure he's okay<br/>with us borrowing it?
Positive.
I got your purse.<br/>(whispering): Oh, Ted, you're the best!
But I'm trapped in Barney's<br/>living room closet.
Oh, Ted, you're the worst.
Okay, enough messing around.
I'm calling in The Wolf.
Lily?<br/>Lily.
(phone ringing nearby)
(ringing is louder)
What are you doing here?<br/>What are you doing here?
(phone beeps) Hold on, Marshall's calling<br/>me on the other line.
Lily, I just saw<br/>the worst thing ever.
Kind of busy right<br/>now, Marshall.
Quiet.<br/>He can hear you.
Who's "he"?
He's coming!<br/>Everyone shut up!
I'm just gonna grab this star<br/>to put on top of the tree.
It's gonna be legend--<br/>wait for it-- merry!
(sighs)
What are you doing here, Lily?
I've been using<br/>Barney's apartment
to pump milk for Marvin.
What?! Why?
LILY: Our apartment<br/>is so crowded these days,
I don't get a minute to myself!
I have a key<br/>to Barney's apartment,
he has a kick-ass couch,
and he DVR's all<br/>the Real Housewives shows,
including the reunion specials.
(whirring)
What are you doing here?
I came to get The Playbook
so I could show Patrice<br/>who Barney really is.
Why can't you just<br/>let them be happy?
Because they're not<br/>really happy, Lily!
BARNEY: Patrice, can you grab my<br/>computer from the bedroom?
I want to change my<br/>Facebook status to "happy!"
You shouldn't have that.
You're right.
(sighs)<br/>What?
Where is Ted?
My label maker!
No! I'm never coming out!
You know, Marshall, you've been<br/>in there for a while now.
And I couldn't help but notice<br/>you chugged that Super Big Gulp.
It's not gonna work, Mickey.
My bladder's<br/>as big as your betrayal!
I see. So it's not gonna<br/>bother you to think
about leaky faucets<br/>or open hydrants,
or rushing rivers, or...
Oh, God, I got to pee. Oh!
What is this?
Where did you find that?
I didn't want to believe<br/>that this existed,
but is this... The Playbook?
(whispering): Let's see him lie his<br/>way out of this one.
Yes, it is.
These are
all the tricks I used
to get women to sleep with me.
What do you<br/>mean, tricks?
Like...
"The Two-Can-Play-at-That Game."
Can I help you?
I'm sorry to be the one<br/>to tell you this, but...
my wife is having an affair<br/>with your husband.
I even found a list<br/>of every dirty way
they've enjoyed<br/>each others' bodies.
I wish there was some way<br/>we could get back at them.
There is.
We can kill them. (laughs)
I'm sorry to be the<br/>one to tell you this...
You're not who I<br/>thought you were.
Patrice, I...
I need some air.
I...
Come on, Patrice, you...
You have got to<br/>be kidding me.
Wait. Is that my mini-cooler?!
Not now, Ted.<br/>Let's go!
Shh! Shh!
Patrice, I have done
some sleazy stuff to<br/>seduce women, but
I want to be a better person.
You make me want to be<br/>a better person.
I can't be with a man<br/>who has a playbook.
I understand.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Is that my garbage can?!
I knew you were a keeper.<br/>(laughs)
Oh.
(rapid, rhythmic beeping,<br/>Barney sighs)
I should go explain<br/>this to the super.
Hey, come with.<br/>There's a small chance
Jon Bon Jovi's<br/>down in the lobby.
"You Give Love a Bad Name"<br/>is the first track
on my "Get Psyched" mix!
Mine, too!
(sighing)
You still don't believe<br/>those two are for real?
I'll take that.
The Ted Mosby Store<br/>is officially closed.
What spilled in here?
Breast milk.
Seriously, I give and give,
and all I ask back<br/>is a little bit of respect.
(sighs)
(laughs)<br/>Okay, so tonight got weird.
You have no idea.
My mom's apparently ready<br/>to get back out there.
Marshall, she told me<br/>all about it,
and I was happy to help.
You helped?! Why?
I know it's hard to think of<br/>your mom as a woman with needs,
but you have to let<br/>her get out there
and rediscover her sexuality<br/>with someone special.
Oh, you don't know.
No, uh, Marshall,<br/>I do know.
You just think it's gross<br/>because it's your parent.
But you know what?
It's beautiful.<br/>Mm.
My mom
and your dad are humping.
(retching)
I think you should be happy<br/>for them.
What? Why?
What is good about this?
Well, first of all,<br/>respect to Mickey.
Your mom's a piece.
She's no Ted's mom,<br/>but she's a piece.
And secondly,
I mean, it's nice<br/>that they found each other.
Sometimes you fall for someone<br/>you'd never expect,
but that doesn't make it wrong.
Doesn't everyone deserve<br/>to be happy?
I guess
none of us thought<br/>of it that way.
Next round's on me.
(sighs)<br/>Wow.
I know.
Barney's lost it.
He needs an intervention.
Oh!<br/>Oh! Oh...
Robin, after<br/>everything we've seen,
do you still think<br/>Barney's faking this?
No, but we have<br/>to stop it.
Barney is not<br/>Barney anymore.
Well, people change.
But not this fast<br/>and this drastically.
This is a cry<br/>for help, okay?
If I was out of control, I<br/>would want you guys to help me.
So, what do you<br/>say? Intervention?
Intervention.
(sighs)<br/>Oh, good. You're all here.
Um,
when Barney shows up,
it's important for him<br/>not to feel ganged up on,
so, let's start with, um,
"We love you,<br/>and we're worried about you."
ALL: We love you,<br/>and we're worried about you.
Oh. Great.
But you know, with less pity<br/>in your eyes.
Sweetie, sit down.
Uh, no. Only the person getting<br/>the intervention sits down.
ALL:<br/>Yeah.
Oh.
Please tell me<br/>this is about my drinking.
Damn it.
So, we, um...<br/>we just wanted to say
that we're sorry for<br/>the way that we acted
when we found out<br/>about you two.
Your happiness is<br/>what is most important,
so, if you two want to date,<br/>it's okay by us.
Who said anything<br/>about dating?
This is just<br/>about sex.
We're family...<br/>with benefits.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Can I get you guys<br/>anything to drink?
BOTH:<br/>Scotch, neat.
Jinx.
(gasps)
Oh, my...
God.
NARRATOR: Kids, you may be wondering<br/>why five adults
in their 30s would take<br/>a jinx so seriously.
It all started one day<br/>five years ago.
Ooh, Van Helsing.<br/>Ooh, Van Helsing.
Jinx. You're jinxed.
That means that you<br/>can't speak until someone
who was present for the<br/>jinx says your name,
or else
you will have<br/>very bad luck.
(scoffs)<br/>That's ridiculous.
(both gasp)
You broke the jinx.
Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man.
I'm on my building's<br/>co-op board.
When I say a Pinot Noir tastes<br/>luxuriously earthy
with a hint of rhubarb,<br/>I'm not faking it.
I've had several
of the same sexual partners<br/>as Henry Kissinger.
I'm not about to stop talking<br/>just because I was jinxed.
NARRATOR:<br/>Barney broke three limbs
and two vertebrae,
but he never broke<br/>another jinx.
In fact, he started taking<br/>jinxes way too seriously.
Barney, I'm on hold<br/>with Sports Talk AM
to talk to my childhood hero<br/>from the Minnesota Twins.
Who's your childhood hero?
Frank Viola. Frank Viola--<br/>jinx!
(over phone):<br/>Hello, this is Frank.
Anyone there?
Hello?
I can hear you breathing,<br/>you coward.
NARRATOR: So, when someone<br/>finally jinxed Barney
for the first time in years,
we were pretty psyched.
The reign of terror is over!
I've had this cigar<br/>in my pocket for two years,
waiting for this moment.
Aw, that would've been good<br/>about two years ago.
Cheers.
(all whooping)
Huzzah!<br/>Huzzah.
LILY: Oh, oh, oh, you want us<br/>to say your name
and un-jinx you?
I don't think so, pal.
This is gonna<br/>be a long jinx.
Like Yom Kippur<br/>services long.
The only difference is,<br/>Yom Kippur's a fast
and this one's<br/>gonna be a slow.
Oh!<br/>ROBIN: Now, Ted,
I was wondering if you could<br/>expand upon what you were saying
earlier about<br/>antiquated currency.
Ah, yes, yes.
Contrary to popular belief,
the buffalo nickel was modeled<br/>on the Black Diamond bison
rather than the more iconic<br/>Western Plains bison.
To wit,
if President Taft<br/>had had his way,
we'd all be talking<br/>about the egret nickel.

NARRATOR: In the winter of 2012<br/>the skyscraper
that I designed was<br/>about to open,
which got me thinking<br/>about the most influential
architecture professor<br/>I ever had.
So when the children<br/>of our grandchildren's children
ask us "Who were we,"<br/>they'll find the answer carved
into the granite poetry<br/>of our architecture.
Okay.
It doesn't get any<br/>better than that.
Class dismissed.
Wow, just wow.
Do you need something?
I have an apple I was hoping<br/>to eat in silence.
Of course,<br/>Professor Vinick, I, um,
I-I sketched out a design,
and it'd be such an honor<br/>if you took a look at it.
Oh, well.
It is believed
that it took the pharaohs<br/>over 100 years
to build the Sphinx.
So...
you think...
I should spend more time on it?
Oh, dear God, no.
This is terrible.
Then, why'd you mention<br/>the Sphinx?
(laughs)
I find my mind is<br/>often with the Sphinx.
Anyway, you'll never<br/>be an architect.
You'll never be an architect.
You'll never<br/>be an architect.
(laughing):<br/>You'll never be an architect!
Well, guess what.
I sent Professor Vinick
the invitation<br/>to the opening of my building,
so he'll see that<br/>I did become an architect,
and that I've moved past<br/>his petty, hurtful words.
ROBIN:<br/>Wow.
15 years later and you're<br/>still this obsessed.
Yeah, if Vinick ever<br/>goes missing,
the cops are gonna come looking<br/>for him in your basement.
Totally, he's Ted's pit guy.
How dare you?
And what is that?
A pit guy is someone
you've been obsessed with<br/>for so long...
that it's driven you<br/>crazy enough
to throw them<br/>in a pit in your basement
like in The Silence<br/>of the Lambs.
(screaming)
(laughing)
I'm not gonna Silence<br/>of the Lambs him.
At most,
I'd Revenge of the Nerds him.
Though I don't see<br/>a scenario where he agrees
to play me in a pentathlon.
Yeah, I'm with Ted-- there<br/>is no one I hate enough
to throw into a pit.
What?
NARRATOR: When Robin's most hated<br/>coworker Patrice
started dating Barney,
she became obsessed.
Patrice, Patrice goes<br/>in your pit.
Guys, I told you, I am done<br/>obsessing about Patrice.
Just drop her.
Drop her in a pit.
Enough.
We all have people that<br/>we would throw in our pits,
and I'm sure we all have people
who would like to throw us<br/>in their pits.
Yeah, if Marshall<br/>or I ever go missing,
I'll tell you whose<br/>basement to look in.
Daryl LaCourte.
Oh, no.
It's creepy Daryl.
Let's get out of here<br/>before he sees us.
Hey, hot sack<br/>coming through.
Ha... ha...
Hi, Daryl. Hey, Daryl.<br/>Hey!
I feel like I never see<br/>you guys anymore.
Like whenever I'm getting<br/>to a party, you're just leaving.
Even that party
at your place--<br/>you guys just raced off
into the night at 7:30.
That's weird.
But this is
great-- the three hackmigos
back together again.
We played Hacky Sack together<br/>once freshman year, Daryl.
Once.
November 14, 1996.
That is the best memory ever.
Sure.
(grunts)
The three hackmigos<br/>for life.
To this day, we are<br/>still getting e-mails
and posts from Daryl.
He has commented<br/>on every photo
of Baby Marvin<br/>we have ever posted,
and then
he comments on his own comments.
(door opens)
(all clamoring excitedly)
Hey, guys, look,<br/>it's Bar...
none, my favorite
non-speaking
jinxed person<br/>in the world.
How was
your day?
Yeah, I didn't get<br/>a word of that.
Sorry, buddy.
Ah, Scherbatsky, it's<br/>my favorite time of year.
Didn't know<br/>you liked Christmas so much.
No, year-end reviews.
We get to fire some people.
Get into the spirit.
Look, Sandy, you might<br/>enjoy firing people
for petty personal differences.
I'd hardly call giving<br/>me gonorrhea
a petty personal difference.
But I am a professional,
and I would never fire someone<br/>for unprofessional reasons.
Well, somebody's got to go.
NARRATOR: Kids, the thing<br/>about pit people,
sometimes you don't<br/>even know you have one
until you have<br/>a chance to push 'em in.
Hi, Robin.
Not happening, bro.
Not happening, bro.
Hand get tired?
Not happening, bro.
I hold in my hand
the RSVP from Professor Vinick.
Uh-huh.
Ah, he's checked
"Will not attend,"<br/>which is fine,
because all I needed<br/>to know was that he knows.
So now I will throw this in<br/>the trash and never look at it.
What's this?
"I believe you've sent this<br/>to the wrong person.
I have no idea<br/>who Ted Mosby is."
Uh-oh.<br/>Uh-oh.
Oh, you'll remember who I am,<br/>Professor Vinick.
You'll never forget it.
Not happening, bro.
Ted, just because we're coming<br/>with you to Wesleyan
does not mean that we condone<br/>your behavior.
Just using it as an excuse
to see the old campus...
and maybe watch you have<br/>a complete mental breakdown.
What are you even gonna do<br/>when you see Professor Vinick?
Oh, I'll tell you<br/>what I'm gonna do.
Sweet merciful Franks Gehry<br/>and Lloyd Wright,
from what brilliant mind was<br/>this work of art sired?
Mosby.
Ted Mosby.
(coughing):<br/>Architect.
But that's-that's...
Impossible?
Looks like<br/>you were wrong, Vinick.
Dead wrong.
(distorted):<br/>No!
(yells)
(laughs)
Be careful, Ted.
Revenge fantasies never<br/>work out the way you want.
Especially dance-<br/>based revenge.
My prom was rough, guys.
LILY:<br/>Ooh!
We're almost there.
Oh, I can't wait<br/>to see the old campus.
I'm gonna grab one of those<br/>giant dining hall hot dogs.
Oh, I love those huge wieners.
I'm not so sure you heard me.
I said, "I love<br/>those huge wieners."
I love them.
In my mouth.
So, let me ask you a few<br/>questions, Clarice... Patrice.
How would you rate<br/>your performance
in the last six months?
Well, I don't like<br/>to talk about myself,
but all my coworkers deserve<br/>an A-double-plus,
that's for suresies.
Ooh,
fancy lotion.
It puts the lotion<br/>in the basket.
It's just, this is<br/>really nice lotion.
And what a pretty basket, Robin.
I know, that's why<br/>I bought it, Patrice!
Man, it's like
nothing has changed.<br/>Mmm, I know.
The bun, the relish.
That's a knee.
It's a beautifully<br/>drawn knee, so?
That's a barn.
Oh, knee barn, right.
That's a great idea, Lily.
On the way home,<br/>we should stop
at the knee barn,
pick us up some wholesale knees.<br/>Yeah.
MAN:<br/>Marshall? Lily!
You... you're here.
Hi, Daryl.<br/>(quietly): Hi, Daryl.
Hi.
Wow,
after all these years.
You look just like you do<br/>in my paintings.
Come here, guys.<br/>(grunts)
There are men<br/>and there are gods.
Antoni Gaudí was both.
TED: There are jerk faces<br/>and there are buttholes.
Professor Vinick was both.
Good one, Ted.
Come on, Vinick,<br/>give me an opening.
Gaudí's architecture<br/>gave expression
to the anarchic geometric form<br/>of nature.
TED (mocking):<br/>"Gaudí's architecture..."
Actually, that's<br/>a really good point.
♪ Wow, Professor Vinick
♪ Man, you taught me so much
♪ About architecture and life
♪ God, your lectures<br/>are so cool ♪
♪ I'll earn your respect<br/>and we'll be best friends. ♪
Okay, it doesn't get<br/>any better than that.
(sniffles)<br/>No, it doesn't.
What are you<br/>doing here, Daryl?
Well, I live<br/>right down the street.
But I work<br/>right here.
Whoa.<br/>Oh, boy.
MARSHALL:<br/>Are those...
(clears throat) ...our,<br/>our faces up there, buddy?
Hack, yeah!
It was just as much<br/>your idea as mine
to open up a Hacky Sack store<br/>here at Wesleyan.
So you never left?
Once. I met a girl<br/>on Craigslist,
and I flew to Boston<br/>to meet her.
She was a man, 300 pounds,<br/>and robbed me.
Still, the best<br/>night of my life.
Until now!
The three hackmigos<br/>back together again!
You know, I've been waiting<br/>forever to give you something.
You're coming with me<br/>to my house,
and I'm not taking no<br/>for an answer.
BARNEY:<br/>Dude, this is your chance.
Set me free,<br/>and I will lie you out
of this creepynightmare.
MARSHALL:<br/>This is a tough one.
On the one hand, we might die.
On the other, you're jinxed.
BARNEY:<br/>Let me free, Marshall.
This guy could be violent.
MARSHALL:<br/>Violent... Viola...
Frank Viola.
We would love to come<br/>to your house, Daryl!
Yeah!
Okay, um...
how often are you<br/>and Barney doing it?
That's a strange question,<br/>Robin.
You're right.
Maybe I should leave.
Yeah, maybe<br/>you should.
You're fired.
Wow. Just wow.
Ted Mosby.<br/>I'm a former student of yours.
You know, I actually became<br/>an architect.
Any chance you remember me?
Oh, please excuse me, I've been<br/>teaching for over 20 years.
All the faces start<br/>to blend together
unless you have a, a weird<br/>mustache or, or something.
Junior year I tried<br/>to grow muttonchops,
but people kept saying<br/>my face made them nauseous.
Well, not people. You.
Anay, I would be honored<br/>if you,
if you took a look<br/>at my building.
This...
is hideous.
You'll never be an architect.
(echoing):<br/>You'll never be an architect.
You'll never be an architect.<br/>You'll never be an architect!
You'll never be an architect.
Wait. I was mistaken.
You most definitely<br/>will be an architect.
Really?
These are astonishing,
Handlebar Pete.
So, when you said<br/>"surprise in your house,"
what you really meant was<br/>"surprise in the poorly lit
windowless basement<br/>of your house."
Oh, you guys are gonna love<br/>what I have to show you.
I am so excited, I could just<br/>cry and laugh and scream
and just punch the wall
over and over and over<br/>and over and over!
Could we just see it,
like, up in the<br/>living room
or anywhere less...<br/>gimp-storagey?
(laughs)<br/>I just realized
I want to take<br/>a picture of this.
I want to put your faces<br/>on my mantel like a trophy.
Like a trophy!
Aah...!<br/>Aah...!
(singsongy):<br/>Here I come.
And I've got your surprise<br/>right here!
No! We don't want<br/>your surprise, Daryl!
We're not your amigos,
we're definitely<br/>not your hackmigos.
And before you murder us,
you should know<br/>that we have a child!
He probably has<br/>eight or nine!
What? Murder?
I wanted to give you a check.
For $100,000...
for coming up with the idea<br/>of the Three Hackmigos with me.
I brought you down here<br/>to show you all my inventory.
Business has really exploded.
(laughs)
I mean, I'm sort<br/>of the Mark Zuckerberg
of jam-band concert<br/>parking lot athletics.
Well, second.
But I'm coming for you,<br/>Devil Stick Ron.
(screaming)
Why would you fire me?
Because nobody should be<br/>as happy as you are.
And also your cookies...<br/>they're only pretty good.
(gasps)
Robin, is this really about me?
(voice breaking):<br/>No, it's not.
The old "fire and bang."<br/>Respect, Scherbatsky.
Pretty good, right?<br/>Right, Handlebar Pete?
Ah, you got it easy with<br/>that sweet, sweet 'stache.
Hey, Ted, I see you're holding<br/>a little version of your building
and yelling at strangers.
So I assume it all worked out?
I realized, since I work<br/>in a three-dimensional medium,
the only way to really stick it<br/>to Vinick would be
with a three-dimensional model.
Whatever you do,<br/>don't march in there
thinking, "I'm<br/>gonna do the worm.
That'll show 'em!"
Seriously, guys,
I can't stress enough<br/>how bad my prom was.
Speaking of the past...
Wow, we feel like idiots.<br/>We're sorry.
You know, honestly,<br/>it's fine.
Look how great I'm doing.
Look at what I've built.<br/>I don't need
the validation<br/>of some people from college
to feel good about myself.
My life is amazing!
I own a timeshare in<br/>St. Barts with P-Funk!
The, the whole band?
Yeah.
Do you guys jam?
That's all we do.
(all gasp)
So, you completely rejected
the guy who's been obsessing
about you for 16 years,<br/>and he was okay with it?
Whoa.
Is creepy Daryl more emotionally<br/>adjusted than I am?
NARRATOR:<br/>Kids, sometimes in life
you'll make a pit<br/>for someone in your mind.
But ultimately the only person<br/>in that pit is yourself.
I'm sorry.
Just seeing you with Barney<br/>has brought up
some old feelings,<br/>and I...
I really don't like feelings.
But that's not your fault<br/>or Barney's fault.
It's just really hard<br/>seeing you with him.
♪ There's been a book<br/>on the side of the bed... ♪
NARRATOR: Which means there's<br/>only one person
who can let you out of the pit.
♪ Many years from now
♪ I know you'll hear me<br/>somehow... ♪
So you fired Patrice?
No, she's staying.
♪ The places we will go...
Let's get out of here, guys.
Oh, Mr. Mosby.
You built a model<br/>of your building.
No.
Why? To prove<br/>some sort of point?
This is just sad.
No, no,<br/>I was just throwing it out.
Sure, you were.
No!
No, I-I-I had a<br/>transcendent moment
where I found emotional clarity!
And I realize shouting that
makes it seem like<br/>it's not true, but I did!
Yeah, we're gonna grab<br/>some snacks.
You guys want anything?
Spicy beef jerky.
Got you loud and clear.
(sighs)
Oh, my God!<br/>Barney!
You unjinxed me!
I'm free! If the bison
on the nickel could hear you<br/>talk about them,
they would diminish their<br/>population even further on purpose.
If Lily wants a big wiener in<br/>her mouth, she's got my number.
And I'm sorry that you took the<br/>rap for all the farting on
the car ride up here.<br/>That was me! (sighs)
The ring!<br/>What's, what's, what's the ring?
Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask<br/>Patrice to marry me.
BOTH:<br/>Are you serious?
Jinx! Good!
I need to say some things<br/>without you interrupting.
Yes, I am serious.<br/>I know that if you could talk,
you'd say that I'm crazy
or that I'm overcorrecting<br/>or that I'm moving too fast.
But you would be wrong.
Look, I have banged my way<br/>through every bimbo
in the tristate area,<br/>and it left me
feeling nothing but, but broken.
But now, with Patrice,
for the first time in my life,<br/>I feel settled and happy.
I want to feel this way forever.
So tomorrow night on the roof
of the World Wide News<br/>building--
that's Patrice's favorite spot--
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ah, poot-tu-tat!<br/>You're jinxed.
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow<br/>these two rules:
one: you can't try to talk me<br/>out of it,
and two: you can't tell anybody.<br/>Agreed?
It's a jinx swear,<br/>so if you break it,
I get to hit you in the nuts<br/>three times
with a Wiffle ball bat.
Thank you... Ted.
Hey...
Hi, guys!
No. But you're jinxed!
I tricked Ted<br/>into saying my name.
ALL:<br/>Aw, come on, Ted!
Jinx! Jinx!<br/>Ha-ha!
The reign of terror<br/>is back! (evil laugh)
Hey, if you guys don't want me<br/>to smoke
or fart in here, just speak up.
Nothing? Great.
Thanks for the spicy<br/>beef jerky, dude.
Anyway, I think we could<br/>all use a little quiet.
Unless you have something<br/>you want to talk about, Ted?
No.
(engine starts)
Not happening, bro.
NARRATOR: So I had promised not to tell<br/>anyone about Barney's plan
to propose to Patrice.
But I knew deep down<br/>Robin deserved to know.
Uh, there he is!<br/>The youngest architect ever
to build a skyscraper<br/>in New York City!
The shockingly still<br/>single Ted Mosby.
You hear that,<br/>ladies?
I can't believe<br/>the GNB Tower opens tonight.
Ted, your building finally<br/>gets unveiled to the whole world.
(gasps)<br/>You hear that, ladies?!
Nervous?
Everything comes out of my<br/>body in liquid form now.
Ignore that, ladies.
Plus, I, I keep<br/>having this nightmare
where King Kong<br/>shows up to the opening
but refuses to climb<br/>my building
because, in his words,<br/>"It's a bit derivative."
Oh, stop it, tonight<br/>is gonna be amazing.
And we are definitely gonna be<br/>there to toast you,
but we might have to leave<br/>a little early if that's okay.
My dad just gave us the most<br/>amazing Christmas gift ever.
Our first night away<br/>since Marvin was born.
24 hours straight without<br/>that little bastard.
ROBIN:<br/>Aw.
This will be a nice memory<br/>to share with Marvin
when he's older<br/>and deciding whether or not
to put you in a home.
Hey, we need this.
We're maximizing<br/>our time away
by planning everything<br/>down to the minute.
See?
2:12 p.m.-- guilt Ted
into saying it's okay<br/>if we leave early tonight.
It's okay if you leave<br/>early tonight.
Look, I just
appreciate you<br/>showing up at all
on your big night away.
I mean, Barney's not<br/>even gonna be there.
What?
This is the biggest<br/>night of your career.
Why isn't Barney coming?
I don't know--<br/>he said,
"Legendary" and "Challenge<br/>accepted," and then he winked.
"Wait for it," you know,<br/>all that stuff.
That does sound like him.
Well, we're your<br/>real friends
and we wouldn't miss<br/>it for the world.
That is why we will<br/>see you tonight
from 7:03 to 7:14.
Bye, guys. Good night.<br/>Bye.
Okay, what's the real reason<br/>Barney's not coming?
NARRATOR: Here was my chance<br/>to tell Robin about Barney.
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't<br/>say what he was doing tonight.
Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not<br/>taking anyone to the opening,
so you want to be my date?
Sure.
Okay, Dad, I-I<br/>made you a list
of Marvin's nightly schedule<br/>down to the minute.
Okay.
Uh, "9:06 p.m.--<br/>put on edible underwear."
Wrong list, wrong list.
Come on, relax.
I know this little guy<br/>like the back of my hand.
Dear Lord, what is that?
Oh, jam, okay.
Just jam.
Oh, I-I forgot<br/>the lullaby.
Do you know<br/>Marvin's lullaby?
We sing it<br/>to him every night.
♪ Night, night,<br/>little Marvin ♪
♪ Stars twinkle for you
♪ The Dreamland train's<br/>a-chuggin' ♪
♪ All your dreams<br/>will come true ♪
♪ And the horsie<br/>says, "Good night" ♪
♪ And the birdie says,<br/>"Good night" ♪
♪ And the elephant<br/>says, "Good night" ♪
♪ And the skeleton playing<br/>his own rib cage ♪
♪ Says, "Good Night"
♪ And the robot says,<br/>"Good night" ♪
(robot voice): Good night.<br/>(knocking on ceiling)
MAN:<br/>Enough with the damn music!
♪ And Mr. Nesbit says,<br/>"Good night" ♪
♪ And the whole world says,<br/>"Good night" ♪
Take it, Mommy.
Got it-- load him up<br/>with cough syrup,
watch Breaking Bad<br/>until he conks out.
Just kidding.
We did it.
Yeah, we did.
Now that we're out the door,
I actually don't feel anxious.
(phone rings)
Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!
Oh, something horrible<br/>happened-- aah!
Oh, it's Ted, relax.
Bar, now.
What is it?
He needs me.
But, baby, what about
our magical romantic night?
In four minutes we're supposed<br/>to be doing hand stuff
in the cab.
I'll be quick--<br/>I'm sure it's nothing huge.
That's huge.
Yeah, that's why Barney's<br/>not coming tonight.
He's getting engaged.
And I knew that<br/>I had to tell Robin.
But?
I may have, uh...
asked her to be my date instead.
What is wrong with me?
Deep down,
is there still<br/>some crazy part of me
that thinks I'm gonna<br/>wind up with Robin?
Am I that deluded?
If so, I need to grow up.
Oh, um, by the way,<br/>I'm breaking a jinx swear here,
so don't tell Barney<br/>or he gets to whack me
in the nuts three times<br/>with a Wiffle ball bat.
Sure, pretty standard.
Robin deserves the chance to go<br/>after Barney one last time
if that's what she wants.
Thanks, buddy.
This helped.
I'm gonna go tell her.
One quick thing.<br/>Yeah.
Don't.
Wow.
Nice.
You know, now that I'm here,<br/>I don't feel that anxious.
(phone rings)
It's my dad--<br/>something horrible's happened!
My husband, relax.
Hey, um, I'm gonna be<br/>a little while, baby.
It's a long story,<br/>but Ted needs my help.
Okay, but hurry
or I'm gonna start doing<br/>number 11 on my own.
You can do that by yourself?
Pilates, bitch.
Okay, why shouldn't<br/>I tell Robin?
Because deep down<br/>some crazy part of you
still thinks you're gonna<br/>wind up with her, and I agree.
Marshall...<br/>I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.
Always have been,<br/>always will be.
Now, listen.
I want my best friend<br/>to be happy.
And if Robin could mean<br/>happiness for you,
then, dear God, why help her<br/>go after another man?
Because she might still be<br/>in love with him.
To not tell her,<br/>to not give her that chance,
it's... it's selfish.
So be selfish.
I can't do that.
Tell that to the onion rings<br/>we just "split."
(sighs)<br/>Robin is my friend.
She's always been more<br/>than that and you know it.
Now, as we speak,
my wife is in a hotel room<br/>cheating on me...
with herself.
But I'm not<br/>leaving here
until you promise not to say
a word about this to Robin.
Now repeat after me. "I..."
Well, I can do more<br/>at a time than "I."
"I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop
"putting everyone else's<br/>interests ahead of my own,
and for once in my life,<br/>do what's best for me."
I...
Sorry, what was<br/>the rest of that?
Hey, Dad, just taking a break
from our amazing night<br/>to check in.
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated<br/>that I'm not there, huh?
Not at all-- I don't think<br/>he even noticed you're gone.
It's kind of like Mommy who?<br/>(laughs)
Oh... oh, good.
But I should probably sing him<br/>his nighttime lullaby
over the phone, just in case.
Sang it already-- nailed it.
Did you do the horsie?
Yep.<br/>The birdie?
Yep.<br/>Elephant?
Yep.<br/>Moose.
No moose, trick question.
Robot.
(robot voice):<br/>Affirmative.
Look, I should go.
Marvin's asleep in my arms.
Mmm, his head smells like love.
Bye.
(sighs)
NARRATOR: And so, kids,<br/>on that cold December night
I decided to take<br/>your Uncle Marshall's advice
and be a little selfish.
Whoa.
Hello... and<br/>hubba-hubba.
Aw, thanks.
But tonight is<br/>about my main man Mosby.
Really?<br/>Why?
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit
the huge thing<br/>that's happening tonight.
Barney's getting engaged.
Ranjit out.
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?
He asked me to keep it a secret,
but I thought<br/>you deserved to know...
in case you wanted<br/>to do something about it.
Do you?
RANJIT:<br/>Do you, Robin?
Ranjit, a little<br/>privacy, please?
Sorry, not listening.
Nice, uneven floor<br/>there, Ted.
(sighs)<br/>Lily, are you drunk?
What? I...<br/>I'm on vacation.
I may have cracked open<br/>the minibar to celebrate.
Who invited the narc?
Hey, listen,<br/>I know that
you miss Marvin, but it's not<br/>like we could've brought him
to a black tie event anyway.
I don't think that<br/>they make tuxedo onesies.
I mean, at least not<br/>ones that are in style.
I mean, a bow tie?
Is it 1998 already?
Yeah, these parents are<br/>so lame and-and clingy.
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord<br/>already, right, guys?
Yeah, yeah,<br/>that baby's not even cute.
Super ugly baby.
It's almost<br/>physically repulsive.
Aw....<br/>Aw...
Great, I just<br/>started lactating.
Me, too.
So, what do you want to do?
Robin, I do not<br/>want to meddle,
but this is like the classic<br/>love song says...
(singing loudly<br/>and high-pitched)
Ranjit.
Ranjit, let's just communicate<br/>via text from now on, okay?
(singing stops)
I appreciate<br/>what you're doing.
But I'm not chasing<br/>after Barney anymore.
I-I just got done being<br/>crazy about all that.
I mean, why would I want to<br/>throw myself back in that pit?
Because you're in love with him.
No, I'm not.
I'm happy for him.
So, it doesn't bother you that<br/>Barney Stinson's gonna propose
to another woman on top of<br/>the World Wide News building?
Wait, why the top<br/>of the World Wide News building?
I guess it's Patrice's<br/>favorite spot in the city.
Damn it, Patrice, that's my<br/>favorite spot in the city!
Whoa.<br/>(phone chimes)
Ranjit says, "Whoa."
Okay... (sighs)
maybe that one detail stings<br/>a little bit,
but that doesn't mean<br/>I'm in love with Barney.
(phone chimes)
"Sounds like she's<br/>in love with Barney."
Okay, is this divider<br/>even slightly soundproof?
(phone chimes)
"Yes."
With a little<br/>winky face.
Look, I... I hope it goes<br/>well for Barney.
I really do.
But tonight there is<br/>no place I would rather be
than at your building.
Celebrating with you.
Are you sure?
Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's<br/>kick-ass building.
I cannot hear you.
We will be there<br/>in five minutes.
This kid does not mean<br/>that you're special.
It just means that you're<br/>horny and you're easy.
Now, come on,<br/>let me smell his head.
Li-Lily, Lily,<br/>no, no, no, no, come on.
Seriously, Ted,<br/>what is up with the floor?
Lily.<br/>What?
Is it harder<br/>than we thought
to be away from<br/>Marvin? Yes.
But are we gonna have fun<br/>or are we gonna wallow
in the corner like idiots?
BOTH (crying):<br/>♪ Night, night, little Marvin
♪ Stars twinkle for you
♪ The Dreamland train's<br/>a-chuggin' ♪
♪ All your dreams
♪ Will come true.
Hey.
Do you realize that something<br/>you thought up in your head
now exists as a part<br/>of the Manhattan skyline?
That's huge.
It's just a building.
I mean, I'm incredibly young<br/>for such an achievement,
but it's just a building.
I mean, Architecture<br/>Vision Weekly
may have dubbed it<br/>"more than just a building,"
but it's just a building.
So let's not get carried...
Okay, you're right, it's huge.
It is huge.
You're the star of the party,<br/>and who knows?
Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby<br/>is gonna be there.
Yeah, maybe she will.
Oh.
Wait, this isn't your...
(sighs)
This is<br/>the World Wide News building.
Go get him.
I told you,<br/>I am done chasing Barney.
Now can we please go<br/>to your party?
Robin, do you want to spend<br/>tonight making small talk
with a bunch of bankers
in a daring yet refined<br/>contemporary masterpiece
King Kong should feel lucky<br/>to climb...
...or do you<br/>want to follow your heart?
Why do you keep insisting that<br/>I have feelings for Barney?
(phone chimes)<br/>Because you do.
See, even Ranjit agrees.
Oh, he's got to pee.
The point is,
you're not over Barney.
That's why you freaked out<br/>about him proposing
on the roof<br/>of the World Wide News building.
I did not freak out.
It's just...
a teeny, tiny bit annoying
that I am the one
who showed her that roof<br/>in the first place!
Damn it, Patrice!
Whoa.
(phone chimes)
"Never mind; I found<br/>a soda bottle."
Okay, that's disturbing.
What do you want me<br/>to do, Ted?
Run up to that roof,
knock the ring<br/>out of Barney's hand,
and say, "Sorry to interrupt,<br/>but you should be with me"?
Is that what you want?
No.
I don't.
I can't keep making<br/>an ass of myself.
Well,
a word in defense of making<br/>an ass of yourself,
it's underrated.
Eight years ago
I made an ass<br/>of myself chasing after you,
and I've made an ass<br/>of myself chasing after you
a bunch of times since then.
But I have no regrets.
Because it led me to something
that I wouldn't trade<br/>for the world.
It led to you being my friend.
So, as your friend
and a leading expert<br/>in the field
of making an ass of yourself,
I say to you
from the heart,
get the hell out of this car.
(exhales)
But, Ted,
your big night.
It's just a building.
(door closes)
BARNEY:<br/>The Robin.
Step one: admit to yourself
that you still have feelings<br/>for this girl.
I am hopelessly,<br/>irretrievably in love with her.
More than she knows.
Step two:
choose the completely wrong<br/>moment to make a drunken move
after hanging out
at a strip club
and get shot down on purpose.
Step three:
agree that you two don't work,<br/>locking the door
on any future<br/>you could have together.
I'm done trying to get you.
I can't do it anymore.
Which will drive Robin nuts.
Huh.
Step four:
Robin goes nuts.
Step five:
find the person<br/>who annoys Robin most
in the world...
Nobody asked<br/>for your help, Patrice!
...and ask for her help.
Oh, hi, Barney.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I'm looking for you.
This may sound kind of weird,<br/>but I have a proposition...
Explain everything to Patrice
and hope she agrees to help.
Yay. I love Robin.
Of course I'll help.<br/>(giggles)
Good, good.<br/>(screams)
Step six:<br/>check with your doctor
about possible broken ribs.
Step seven:<br/>pretend to be dating Patrice.
Nobody asked you here,<br/>Patrice!
Actually, I did.
Step eight:
wait until Robin inevitably<br/>breaks into your place
to find the Playbook<br/>and show it to Patrice,
which you'll monitor<br/>via the hidden cameras
you have in your apartment.
Patrice, the robin's<br/>in the nest.
That means Robin broke<br/>into my apartment
Were you even listening<br/>when I explained the codes?
Step nine: after Patrice<br/>finds the Playbook,
have your first big fight.
This is going so well.
Thank you so much.
I know, but what the heck<br/>are Lily and Ted doing here?
I don't know.<br/>My friends have no boundaries.
(groans)<br/>How can I ever thank you?
Will you watch my<br/>cat next weekend?
No.
Come on, we should probably<br/>go back inside.
Step ten:
prove your loyalty to Patrice
by burning the Playbook,
and actually burn it.
You don't need it anymore.
Step 11:
because your friends<br/>have no boundaries,
they'll inevitably have
an intervention for Robin,
which you'll monitor<br/>via the hidden cameras
you have in Marshall<br/>and Lily's apartment.
Step 12:
tell only Ted about your plan
to propose to Patrice.
You can't tell anybody.
Agreed?
Step 13:
wait and see<br/>if Ted tells Robin,
and if he does...
Barney's getting engaged.
...it means your best bro<br/>in the world
has let go of Robin<br/>and has given you his blessing.
Step 14:<br/>Robin arrives
at her favorite spot<br/>in the city
and finds the secret final page
of the Playbook.
The last play
you'll ever run.
Step 15: Robin realizes
she's standing<br/>underneath mistletoe.
(sighs)
Seriously, Barney?
Even you,
even someone<br/>as certifiably insane as you
must realize<br/>that this is too far.
You lied to me,
manipulated me for weeks.
Do you really think I could<br/>ever kiss you after that?
Do you really think
I could ever trust you<br/>after that?
This...
this is proof
of why we don't work,
why we'll never work.
So thank you.
You've set me free because...
how could I be with a man<br/>who thinks that this...
trick, this enormous lie
could ever make me want<br/>to date him again?
Turn it over.
(sighs)
Robin Scherbatsky...
...will you marry me?
Yes.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in late 2012...
I received a very<br/>important text message.
Uncle Barney and Aunt<br/>Robin were engaged...
marking a truly happy<br/>time for our little group.
The problem was... one of<br/>us was definitely not happy.
Marvin will not stop crying.
What do you guys think it is?<br/>Is he hungry?
Well, that must be it.
Huh! Thank you for<br/>thinking of that, Ted.
And here we were just watering him<br/>and facing him towards the sunlight.
Sorry. I haven't slept in...
January.
Food going in isn't the problem.
It's what's coming out... or not coming out.
- He hasn't pooped in three days.<br/>- Yeah.
Normally, I wouldn't wish one of his<br/>dirty diapers on my worst enemy...
but now I kind of miss poppin'<br/>the hood in the morning...
and finding that first big,<br/>juicy, black...
Lily! I'm eating chili.
I'm eating chili, Lily.
Confetti.
Big blast of confetti.
Normally, the kid's<br/>a confetti machine.
He's Rip Taylor in a diaper.
I have a feeling at this point,<br/>Rip Taylor is Rip Taylor in a diaper.
And with that image,<br/>dinner is done.
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Well, well, well.
Here comes the bride!<br/>Now the annoying part, right?
Planning the wedding.
- So not fun, right?<br/>- I don't know. I'm kind of looking forward to it.
Fine. I'll do it for you.
First thing we need<br/>to do is set a date.
May 25, 2013.
Thank you, Ted.<br/>The ladies are talking.
Actually, that... that is the date.
Ted offered to help with<br/>the planning a little.
And, well, uh...
- That's a big binder.<br/>- Oh, this?
This is just cakes.
Anyway, we're having<br/>the ceremony...
at that beautiful little<br/>church out on Long Island...
where Victoria almost got<br/>married... lovely spot.
And then we're gonna have a<br/>reception in a big white tent...
on the front lawn of the hotel.
Oh, and, uh, the colors are cream and lilac.
- I'm-a cut you, bitch!<br/>- Oh, Lily, Lily, L-Lily...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Hey, Robin, where's Barney?<br/>Did he skip town already?
If so, exactly what time was it?
It's important for the over-under.
Barney's fine. It's just, well,<br/>earlier this morning...
So, it's been three<br/>days since I said yes.
True.
And your panic attacks are getting<br/>shorter and further apart.
I can't do this!<br/>I feel like I'm drowning!
Also true.
So I guess we're<br/>officially engaged.
Maybe we should tell our parents.
I assume my dad already knows. You did<br/>call him and got his permission, right?
Yeah, yeah, Robin.
I... I bought you with an ox<br/>and some spices from the East.
He's gonna put you in a cage...
and send you on horseback<br/>to my remote desert camp.
- Okay, Barney...<br/>- Hold on. I'm not done.
Where you'll be bathed<br/>in perfumes and oils...
and delivered to my tent.
After you perform the traditional<br/>Dance of the Seven Veils...
we'll adjourn to the tiger<br/>skin rug where we'll...
- Barney...<br/>- Robin!
If we're gonna build a<br/>marriage together...
we have got to stop interrupting<br/>each other all the time.
Fine. Finish your story.
Thank you.
Where we'll... do it.
- Did you ask for my father's permission?<br/>- No, I did not.
As some of you know,<br/>my dad is a little scary.
A little? Dude's a<br/>stone-cold Slytherin.
He always looks like he just<br/>came from slapping some guy...
tied to a chair in a back room.
Anyway, we go get lunch...
I know I already told you this,<br/>but my dad is a scary guy.
Please, I think I can handle...
Oh, vampire in the daylight.<br/>Vampire in the daylight!
Oh.
- Hello, Robin.<br/>- Hello, sir.
Put that thing away.<br/>Give your old man a hug.
And then it got really scary.
I'm glad you could meet me<br/>here at my favorite restaurant.
Carol and I come here all the time.
I... You...
When... Da... Who's Carol?
Oh, right. You...<br/>You haven't met Carol.
Um, very special woman.
Forty-eight years old,<br/>dental hygienist, no kids.
Likes Zumba.
She's the reason I<br/>moved to New York City.
Eight months ago.<br/>Thanks for the call, by the way.
Well, I figured you knew.
It's on my Facebook page.
You really should respond<br/>to my friend request.
I post a lot of great stuff.
Are you familiar with memes?
There's a cat who says,<br/>"I can has cheezburger?"
Okay, what the hell<br/>happened to you?
Robin, I know in the past...
I have been... emotionally distant.
But Carol has brought out<br/>a whole new side of me.
I have a new outlook on life...
a devil-may-care insouciance<br/>that embodies the credo...
"No shirt, no shoes, no problem."
Robin, I'm fun now.
- Oh!<br/>- Oh, God.
- He's fun now?<br/>- That does not sound fun.
No child should have to see<br/>a parent go through that.
Well, it probably took some of the<br/>pressure off the Barney of it all.
Sir, hi.
My name is Barney Stinson.
This is Barney?
This man is blond.
Grown men are not blond!
- Dad!<br/>- Pleased to meet you.
That's a very... fun hair color.
That's nothing. When he met me,<br/>his first words were, "Nice blouse."
- You were wearing a blouse.<br/>- It was not a blouse!
Oh, great. You're all here.<br/>Let's talk about our wedding band.
How much do you guys think they should rock?<br/>'Cause I vote a million.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we already<br/>settled on a deejay, so...
Lily, do you remember the band you<br/>guys almost hired for your wedding?
Remember them? I'll call them<br/>up and book them for you.
- Just say the word.<br/>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I... I feel like we keep coming<br/>back to this deejay thing.
- What do you think, baby?<br/>- I don't think anyone should book anything right now.
Well, why not?
Well, I am going to the<br/>room marked "Spaghettis"...
which I'm hoping is<br/>the ladies' room.
"Meatballs" has to be men's, right?
I don't know what the hell<br/>"Calamaris" is.
Um...
- Sir, I... I...<br/>- Permission denied.
And it turns out<br/>"spaghettis" are men.
I saw a noodle.
- He said no?<br/>- Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do.
Relax, baby. I got this.
I know how to be persuasive.
The next day, Uncle Barney<br/>met Robin's dad for lunch...
at the same restaurant...
this time, with a plan.
Hello, Mr. Scherbatsky.<br/>I think we got off on the wrong foot.
You have my attention.
I left the meatball at home so I could<br/>talk to you spaghetti to spaghetti.
Sir, I'm very serious about<br/>marrying your daughter.
Barney, when I wanted to<br/>marry Robin's mother...
I slaughtered a whole family<br/>of bears with my bare hands.
I gave the pelts and<br/>the bear meat...
to her father as tribute.
You know what we call<br/>that in Canada? Manners.
Would either of you<br/>like a Mudslide?
I just had one, thank you.
I'll have a Jazzy Pizzazzy<br/>Razzleberry Rainbow milk shake...
with a swirly straw.
You didn't say the magic word.
I'll go get your drink.
- Still crying, huh?<br/>- Yeah.
We've tried everything short of a<br/>pack of smokes and a cup of coffee.
Still nothing but clean dipeys.
There's only one<br/>explanation for this.
Marvin has potty-trained himself.
He sneaks into the bathroom<br/>while we're sleeping.
I'll ask Barney to check the tapes.
Barney has cameras in our bathroom?
Well, I mean, don't you think?
- Hey, guys.<br/>- Robin, good.
You're here. Bad news.
That wedding band you<br/>wanted is booked for May 25.
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?
Oh! Oh, hey! Here's an idea.
Oh, God, Ted,<br/>if you suggest a deejay...
Far from it.<br/>I was gonna suggest a band.
A band called Kool and the Gang.
Robin, would you like for me...
to get Kool and the Gang<br/>to play at your wedding?
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
And would it be okay if they<br/>invited their friends...
Beyonc? and-and ABBA...
and the Bee Gees and<br/>Journey and Queen?
What? What are you say... How...<br/>How is that even possible?
I'll tell you how.<br/>You hire a deejay.
Wicka-wicka-wicka! Burn.
Ugh! God, this is, like, the 15th time<br/>my dad has sent me a friend request.
- I'm just gonna hit "accept."<br/>- No!
No, no, no. Don't do it, Robin.
- You don't want to see what's behind that door.<br/>- What are you talking about?
He's talking about my<br/>mom's 2,000-word review...
of Fifty Shades of Grey.
And 14 of those words were "vulva."
You're gonna get endless<br/>requests to play some game...
that has something to do<br/>with gangsters and farming.
Never mind the embarrassing<br/>cheerleading photos from high school.
Begged my mom to burn those.
Robin, trust me.
No good can come from<br/>accepting that friend request.
Yeah, I... I think I may have given<br/>you guys the wrong impression.
Okay, my dad is actually<br/>not that bad of a guy.
Do it, Barney.<br/>Squeeze that trigger.
I don't want to do this.
- You think I wanted to kill that bear?<br/>- Yeah, kinda.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I can't do this.
What... What the hell is this?
Your dad is crazy!
He wanted me to kill Fluffernutter!
- I told you not to give him a name!<br/>- Well, I did!
I gave him a name and a backstory.
He comes from a magical rabbit warren<br/>underneath the old rusty tractor.
He was the runt of the litter,<br/>but he persevered.
Oh, give me this. Give it to me!
Dad, is there, um,<br/>something you wanna tell me?
Well, in the early '80s...
I did some wet work for the C. I.A.
Yes, Daddy. I remember<br/>the bedtime stories.
No, I'm, uh, talking<br/>about your Facebook page?
It says you're married.
Well...
Yes, uh, Carol and I<br/>were in Key Largo...
at a performance of the<br/>recording artist James Buffet.
We're what is known<br/>as Parrot Heads.
And, uh, well, one thing led to the other...
and, uh, we got married.
You didn't want to<br/>tell me about it?
I facebooked it on Facebook.
Okay, you know what, Dad?
Since you obviously<br/>have no interest...
in involving me in<br/>your personal life...
I may as well tell you...<br/>Barney and I are already engaged.
That's right.
I'm behind you on this, Robin.
Directly behind you.
Anyway, this is happening.
And since I wasn't invited to your wedding,<br/>you're not invited to mine.
Good-bye.
Oh, no!
Fluffernutter peed<br/>all over my pants!
So, I just called up that<br/>wedding band's road manager...
to get the number of the people<br/>who booked them for the 25th...
so I could bribe them<br/>into giving up the band.
You did what? That is so dishonest!
No matter what happens next, I<br/>th... I think we can all agree,<br/>you're in the wrong here, Lily.
- It's your number, Ted.<br/>- All right. You got me!
I put a nonrefundable<br/>deposit on that band...
to keep Barney and Robin<br/>from booking them.
And I would've gotten<br/>away with it...
if it wasn't a really<br/>stupid and expensive plan.
Dude, why would you do that?
I don't see what the big deal is.
The big deal is, Robin deserves better<br/>than some crappy, unreliable band.
Sure, bands seem cool with their nice<br/>suits and their well-rehearsed moves...
but let's be honest...<br/>bands let you down.
They... They cheat. They deceive.
And God knows, they've slept<br/>with every girl in New York City.
I just... I can't believe Robin<br/>is going through with marrying...
the idea of getting a band.
And that is... That's a perfectly<br/>normal way to phrase that.
Okay, Ted. Bar.
- Now.<br/>- Nice try.
You're gonna stick<br/>me with that baby...
so that you guys can spend five<br/>minutes sorting out his love life...
followed by an hour of you getting drunk<br/>and pretending to be in The Departed.
You know what? I'm sorry, Lily.
Okay? But I just need to know.
- Are you a cop?<br/>- I'm not a cop!
- Are you a cop?<br/>- I'm not a cop!
Uh-uh.
I got this. Ted. You, me.<br/>Upstairs. Roof. Now.
- What? It's January.<br/>- Move!
Let's cut the crap.<br/>We're both freezing.
- Just say it, and we can go downstairs.<br/>- Say what?
Say how much you hate that Robin<br/>and Barney are getting married.
What? No, I... I'm happy for them.
L-I encouraged Robin<br/>to go after Barney.
I know. Because you thought<br/>you were okay letting her go.
But now that she's<br/>really gone, it hurts.
Kids, at that point in my life...
I'd been hurt quite<br/>a few times already.
Today, we're gonna braid<br/>friendship bracelets.
There's a very<br/>simple explana... Ah!
This one time,<br/>I was playing tennis and...
- Oh! Ow!<br/>- Ow!
Hey, Schmosby. Remember when you<br/>dookied in your pants down by the lake?
Unbelievable!
Oh!
Do you love me?
No.
But when I saw that text message...
and found out Robin was engaged,<br/>it was like...
Ah!
- - There... - - Ooh!
Unbelievable!
- - Ooh! - Aah! - No.
Times a million.
I am happy for them.
Is all you'll let<br/>yourself say out loud.
Because if you said<br/>anything to the contrary...
well, that would make you the<br/>most awful person on this rooftop.
So, I'm gonna give you an out.
And how are you gonna do that?
By saying something that is even more awful.
Like what?
Sometimes I wish I wasn't a mom.
Sometimes I want to pack a bag and<br/>leave in the middle of the night...
and not come back.
Robin shouldn't be with Barney.<br/>She should be with me.
- You serious?<br/>- I don't know.
I mean, I love being a mom.
I... I love Marvin so much.
But do you remember when<br/>I wanted to be an artist?
Art was my whole life.
And-And now it's been months since<br/>I've even picked up a brush.
L-I spend the whole day taking<br/>care of kids at my job...
and I come home,<br/>and it's more of the same.
It just... It never lets up.
It's just really, really hard, Ted.
Have you talked to Marshall<br/>about how you feel?
Have you talked to Robin about how you feel?
Fair enough.
I just think we have to<br/>accept our lots in life...
and I have to be a mom to a...
a beautiful, wonderful...
if slightly constipated,<br/>little boy...
and you have to let Robin<br/>and Barney get a band.
All right. Let's see<br/>what's in this dipey.
Nothin'.
Absolutely nothing.
Hey. Are you finally<br/>giving Daddy a smile?
Oh! Oh, God!
And, no, it wasn't confetti.
Oh! Oh, God!
Please!
Holy confetti!
That night, Robin agreed to<br/>meet her dad one more time.
Your dad has something to say.
I'm sorry for getting married<br/>without consulting you.
It was wrong of me.
There. Now, Robin...
I know that no mere<br/>apology will fix this.
And that is why...
I've asked Carol for a divorce.
- What?<br/>- She's heartbroken, understandably.
- Possibly suicidal.<br/>- I did not tell him...
But if that's the price<br/>for my daughter's love...
then I will gladly<br/>let Carol pay it.
Was that not what you wanted?
You want to know what I want?
A normal dad. That's all.
I... I want you to give this<br/>blond guy permission to marry me.
Come to the wedding. Give me away.
Smile in the pictures, and then<br/>dance with me like a normal dad.
Is that too much to ask?
Of course not.
Oh, Robin, my darling girl,<br/>of course I'll do all that stuff.
I love you, and I'm proud of you.
- He didn't say that?<br/>- No.
Fine. One dance.
"Cheeseburger in Paradise."
And Carol's going to sing it.
Well, see you at the wedding.
But it's kind of amazing.
I mean, he's never<br/>apologized to me in his life.
Barney made it happen.
He must really love me.
He'd be crazy not to.
I'm really happy for you guys.
But I still think you<br/>should get a deejay.
- For God's sakes, Ted.<br/>- Hear me out.
I can't take...
I made a pretty strong case that night,<br/>but in the end, she didn't want a deejay.
She wanted a band. And guess what happened.
That's right. The band<br/>canceled at the last minute...
just like I said they would.
The wedding is in a week,<br/>and no bands.
When will people realize I<br/>always know what's what?
He says to the lesbian he dated for a month.
That's a fair point.
Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh,<br/>happen to know of any good wedding bands...
available at the last minute,<br/>would you?
Ted, do you believe in destiny?
You really don't know me, do you?
We just had brunch<br/>with my ex-roommate.
- The bass player?<br/>- No, she's not just a bass player.
She's a bass player in the best<br/>wedding band in the tristate area.
They had a gig lined up for this weekend,<br/>but it just fell through this morning.
You, my friend, are gonna save that wedding.
- Do you know any deejays?<br/>- Dude, come on!
Let it go, bro. Just let it go.
All right, all right, all right.<br/>Well, I guess, uh...
Guess it's a lucky thing<br/>I ran into you guys.
And, kids, "lucky"<br/>doesn't even begin to describe it.
Because if Robin and Barney had taken<br/>my stupid advice and hired a deejay...
I never would have met your mother.<br/></div>]

[<div class="full-script">You guys. You guys will not<br/>believe what just happened.
On my way here, a taxi
jumped the curb<br/>and it pinned this old lady,
and I-i just went into this,<br/>like, crazy adrenaline mode
and I somehow lifted it off her.
Oh, my God, Ted,<br/>your wrist.
Oh, yeah, I guess<br/>it's a little swollen.
I must've strained it lifting.<br/>No,
I believe our dear<br/>friend Lily was referring
to your other wrist.
The one wearing the<br/>male birth control.
I was gonna go with
"chastity bracelet."
God, is it possible<br/>to love you more?
Really?<br/>Really? I just
saved someone's life, and<br/>you guys are focusing on this?
Yeah, you know what,<br/>guys? Leave him alone.
All right,<br/>he's a hero.
Thank you.
Do you think that your<br/>super strength came from
wearing wonder woman's<br/>magic wrist cuff?
Yeah, I'll have you know<br/>that because of this cuff,
I have a date.
With some hand lotion<br/>and the Internet?
It is possible<br/>to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
Great. Bring her in.
You know what? It's so nice out.
Why don't... why don't<br/>we just all go for a walk.
It's pouring rain, Ted.<br/>I think it's pretty obvious
she can't fit through the door. mm.
She is a gorgeous,<br/>athletic woman.
"athletic"?<br/>Sideburns, no cans.
She is hot.
So why can't<br/>she come in, Ted?
She can come in.
In six and a half months.
Wait.<br/>Are you saying she's...
twenty.
And a half.
Almost.
Ah-ah! Hold up, guys.
She had to bounce. Um,<br/>a flash mob broke out in front
of a line of Korean-Mexican<br/>food trucks in williamsburg.
The only thing
that would make her<br/>more of a 20-year-old
is an ironic form
- of transportation.<br/>- Yeah.
She's roller skating there.
I don't know<br/>which is more pathetic...
that you're going out<br/>with a 20-year-old
or that you bought a leather<br/>cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this
to get a date.
I just happened to be out
catching up on<br/>some Saturday afternoon
leather cuff shopping,<br/>oh.
And she just happened to be<br/>a leather cuff saleswoman.
God, I am so glad I am<br/>done chasing bimbos.
Now that I'm engaged,<br/>that whole part of my life
just seems<br/>sad and empty.
I don't want this<br/>to sound
too harsh, Ted,<br/>but you disgust me.
Until a month ago, your<br/>headboard had a lube dispenser.
Uh, yeah.
We got rid of that, okay? Yeah.
Anyway, speaking of engaged,
check out what got back<br/>from being resized.
Oh, my God.<br/>Look at the size of that rock.
Barney, you don't
start with the<br/>I-got-caught-cheating diamond.
You give yourself<br/>room to grow.
It's a family heirloom.
Yeah, I got<br/>a few dirty looks
from Barney's half-sister<br/>over Christmas,
so I had to sit her down<br/>and explain very respectfully...
that she can suck it.
Okay.
I got to bounce.
Stop saying that.
This dj from Dubai is spinning
at an abandoned loading dock<br/>in bushwick.
I'm worried I don't<br/>have enough layers.
So what if my friends
thought it was doomed?
I was still young, and I knew<br/>that a night of partying
with a girl<br/>over a decade younger than me
would be a total...
...disaster. She's like<br/>an entirely different species.
And I definitely didn't<br/>have enough layers.
I didn't understand half<br/>the words she was saying.
To me, it all sounded<br/>like hipster mad libs.
Didn't you check your phone?
I just "means of contacting" you
on "currently hot<br/>social networking site."
the show's been moved
to "New York neighborhood"
you've never heard of."
oh. Wow, my phone has a clock.
And they subsist on a diet of<br/>pointlessly weird combinations.
Ooh.
Hey, do you want to split<br/>a kimchi cupcake
with bacon frosting?
They are the best here.
Uh, yeah.<br/>Yeah, that'll go great with my
cucumber jalapeño<br/>egg cream.
Chug it! Come on. Come on.
We got to get going.<br/>Right. Okay.
Then later, at a club<br/>in Chinatown
somehow located<br/>beneath a manhole cover,
it got weird.
God, I just love those
tiny gray hairs<br/>in your eyebrows.
Old men are so sexy.
All right, to be fair,
some of those gray hairs<br/>were dried egg cream.
Turns out, when you
projectile vomit on skates,
you roll right into the spray.
Wait, how old does<br/>she think you are?
So, were you in Vietnam?
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot! She likes old guys!
Anyway, when we got out<br/>on the dance floor, th...
I swear, this is what all<br/>the 20-year-olds looked like...
I want to thank you for your<br/>service to this nation, private.
Colonel.
Aw.
I got to end this.
Yeah, seriously, Ted.
Pretending to be someone else<br/>just to get laid?
That's...<br/>embarrassing.
Your highness!
Let's go.
Ew. Marshall,<br/>take that off.
What? I think it looks<br/>kind of cool.
Cool?
You look like one of those jerks<br/>who's in some lame band
and rides a motorcycle without<br/>a helmet and has a wallet chain
and neck tattoos<br/>and a drug problem.
Not a... a big one, just, uh...
enough that he deals a little<br/>bit on the side, and...
he can never...<br/>ever be true to one woman.
Finish that damn pickle<br/>and do me!
Okay, you guys know how<br/>my mornings usually go.
Why would we care how...
usually it's like this.
After you.
Aw, thank you.
On the house, Robin!
♪ take this bagel on the house
♪ have a paper on the house
♪ I'd give you a house<br/>on the house ♪
♪ if I could
♪ you're so beautiful
♪ everything in life<br/>should be free ♪
♪ it's so wonderful to be me!
Mmm.
Wow.
Do little bluebirds help you<br/>get dressed in the morning, too?
♪ she's exaggerating
♪ to make a point!
But today was different.
That'll be $3.75.
But I didn't have<br/>to pay yesterday.
Okay. $7.50.
Oh, honey-sweetie-baby.<br/>It's the ring, Robin.
The ring has power.
When a woman puts on<br/>an engagement ring,
it's like when bilbo baggins<br/>wears the one ring
in the hobbit.
Okay, can you say that again<br/>but not in nerd?
Sure. Uh, the ring<br/>is like the cloak
that Harry Potter wears<br/>to sneak around Hogwarts.
Yeah, I don't speak virgin<br/>either.
The ring... it<br/>makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
Oh, good, you're awake.
Look, Ted,
there's something<br/>we have to talk about.
Boundaries?<br/>Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
It's about the 20-year-old, Ted.
You have to bang her.
For me!
Why do you want me to hook<br/>up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
Yeah, that was<br/>all an act.
Look, look, look, I love Robin
and she's the only girl<br/>I want to be with.
But my body is detoxing<br/>after years of one-night stands.
They don't make
gum or a patch for this, Ted.
But, hey,<br/>billion-dollar idea alert.
Oh, yeah.
That's okay. I'll just buy<br/>a new dream journal.
What-what-what<br/>are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's got to<br/>be some pictures
of her in here.
Damn it. no.
Those are all worthless.
I need some one-night-stand<br/>material, Ted.
Oh. Oh. Here's your mom.<br/>Hello, Virginia.
Um, my mother is not<br/>one-night-stand material.
Yeah, you're right. It wasn't<br/>night and we weren't standing.
Hey-oh!
That didn't happen.
You're right. It didn't.
You just winked.
No, I didn't.
You just did it again!
Look, bottom<br/>I need you
to proxy bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in
and put your gland in.
Hey, wow,<br/>that'd be good on a hat.
Barney,
she's just using me<br/>for my gracefully aging body.
You're picking now<br/>to get some self-respect?
You once banged a blind girl by<br/>pretending to be Sean connery.
That was you.
Yeah, that conquest
was most enjoyable.
I'm sorry.<br/>T-to hook up with a girl,
I have to connect with her<br/>at least a little.
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
Nothing about weird poets<br/>or buildings
or any of those stupid articles<br/>you've ever e-mailed me
with the subject line<br/>"food for thought."
please, Ted.
I need this.
Fine. You win.
I'll bang
a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna be awesome.
Now, turn off the lights and go.
Not all the way!
Hello. Yeah, three...
okay, normally New York<br/>is the friendliest,
most affordable city<br/>in the world.
Now it's as rude and expensive<br/>as San Francisco.
Guys?
Oh, hey, that's life<br/>once you're engaged.
Oh, tell her, baby.<br/>Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may<br/>or may not be on
when you get there.
They won't be!
Okay, what is going<br/>on with you guys?
It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me<br/>as a loser musician
with a Vicodin addiction<br/>and a beat-up van
I use to steal copper wire<br/>really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
Whoa, what-what happened<br/>to your wrist?
Oh. It's an allergic reaction.
So take it off.
Robin, once you have a child,
anything that gets you<br/>even remotely close
to the possibility of sex is<br/>worth a few pus-filled blisters.
Better the sores<br/>weep than I.
Hey, hold on. That<br/>slut just got here.
How'd she get<br/>beer already?
Do you see a ring<br/>on that finger?
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you saying that<br/>this invisibility thing
means I might not be able<br/>to get beer?
I was just getting used to the<br/>idea of having to pay for coffee
and bagels and rent.
Rent?<br/>But not being able
to get a beer? Unacceptable.
Excuse me.
Hot girl coming through.
Huh.
Three beers, please.
♪ take the...
damn it, ring!
Oh, yeah, baby.<br/>Mm-hmm.
Later you should totally<br/>go out and buy a switchblade.
Mm. Sure.
While I'm out, maybe daddy<br/>picks up some diapers
and a little mild salsa<br/>because we're low.
Well, you're right...
I'm invisible.
That night, the only person
in worse shape than Robin<br/>was her fiancé.
Ted, I'm desperate.
Earlier today,<br/>I saw that wrist cuff
and I got a partial<br/>for Marshall.
Did you bang that girl yet?
Don't get your hopes,<br/>or anything else, up.
I tried to connect with her,
but everything<br/>just comes back
to her weird fetish<br/>about how old I am.
Well, j-just go simple...<br/>does she like TV?
No.
But I'll watch 60 minutes<br/>with you
as loud and as long as you want.
Sports?
No.
But I bet you look super hot<br/>playing shuffleboard,
just... slathered in bengay.
Well, does she like books?
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
I bet you have a big, thick
pair of bifocals.
She doesn't have daddy issues,<br/>she has granddaddy issues.
I'm ending it.
Ted, I beg of you, don't quit<br/>on a body that won't quit.
Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet<br/>on a bumper sticker.
That's going in the journal.
Wait, did you steal
my dream journal?
No! Now, get back in there<br/>before all your teeth fall out
and you're naked in front<br/>of shaker heights high school
in a play<br/>you never rehearsed for.
Bastard!
We don't connect<br/>on a single thing. It's over.
It's not...
look, carly, I got<br/>to tell you something.
I just, I don't see<br/>a future here.
Oh, my God.
Are you dying?
Oh, that is so hot.
Hey...
is that r2-d2?
Do you like star wars?
I love star wars.
Me, too!
I mean, I've only<br/>seen the new ones.
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!<br/>I could feel it.
It's almost like we were<br/>hooking up with her together.
You felt that, right?
I couldn't have performed<br/>if I did.
Don't you see, Ted?
We had a bro-nnection.
All right, I got to know
what she looks like...<br/>show me a picture.
Well, normally,<br/>I'm above such things,
but it's been a while,<br/>and, uh, Teddy's braggin'.
Okay, here she is.
Okay. Scrolling up.
Oh, yeah, those are
"plow me" heels. Nice.<br/>Uh-huh.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up<br/>to those 20-year-old ta-tas.
Oh... gravity's cruel grasp
hasn't found you yet,<br/>my sweet perky miracles.
Now, let's get a gander<br/>at dirty girl's face.
Mm-hmm.
Her face says, "ready to bone,"<br/>am I right?
I say again, am I right?
That's my half-sister.
Then you probably shouldn't<br/>scroll to the next picture.
No!
That's my sister, Ted!
Well, look,<br/>I didn't know!
None of us even knew<br/>you had a sister
until two years ago,<br/>including you!
This is just<br/>some crazy coincidence.
There are four million women<br/>in the city of New York,
Ted, and you sleep<br/>with my sister?
Why would the universe do that to me?<br/>I don't know.
It's not like you've ever<br/>treated women in such a way
that would invite some sort<br/>of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
My sweet, little, innocent...
pierced.<br/>Really? Where?
Don't answer that!<br/>Now I know
why I felt everything<br/>you did to her last night.
It wasn't a bro-nnection,<br/>it was a sis-nnection!
Oh, my God.
Ted... did you...
big-time.
Nice! High five!
Wait! No! no!
Retraction five!
Hey, hey, you're the one<br/>who begged for a proxy bang.
And while we're<br/>on the subject of family,
I'm pretty sure you banged<br/>my mom... mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You just did<br/>the winking thing again!
No, I didn't.
Fine. Hey, Barney,<br/>let me ask you something.
Were you, uh, feeling<br/>a little sore this morning?
Especially...
friendship over!
Oh, yeah.
Who's your guitar-player-biker-<br/>who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa...
but-said-screw-it-<br/>and-went-medium bad boy?
Marshall, your hand!
Okay, I'm pretty sure<br/>it wasn't that bad,
but this is how uncle Marshall<br/>likes to tell the story.
Oh, yeah, no,<br/>that's the cuff.
I'm woozy,<br/>and I can't flex my fingers...
...and the rotten fish smell<br/>is getting stronger.
But I'm learning to compensate<br/>with my left.
Is that why last night when<br/>I asked you to honka honka me
you only honka'd me?
I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous<br/>of crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
No, but, baby,<br/>then all the sex will stop.
Marshall, you don't need a cuff<br/>for me to find you sexy.
All you have to do
is smile, and I'm ready<br/>for you to hop on pop.
Thanks, baby.
Are you too woozy to<br/>do it one last time
before we seek emergency<br/>medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
Mm.
I'm sorry, bro,<br/>I totally overreacted.
You think?<br/>I can't believe
you're allowed<br/>to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed<br/>to be an olive branch.
Are you sure<br/>he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
And wait, you-you forgive me?
Absolutely.<br/>Hey, I got a couple "cee-gars."
get over here!
All right.<br/>So, where are those "cee-gars"?
Eh, we'll break 'em<br/>out in a minute.
Hey, barn.
Ted?
Barney, what is<br/>your sister doing here?
Nothing, bro.<br/>Or should I say,
bro-in-law!
Congratulations!
You're marrying<br/>my sister!
And you spared no expense,<br/>you big crazy!
You know what?<br/>I love Barney,
but this ring thing sucks.
Some gross guy just<br/>brushed up against my rack
and then apologized.
And I think he really,<br/>really meant it.
Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice<br/>to be groped by strangers,
but nothing beats<br/>the rush you get
when that one special person<br/>looks at you.
It's true.
Like here in this bar, there's<br/>only one thing that I see,
and I see her brighter<br/>and more clearly
than anything else<br/>in this world.
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol
mixed with some<br/>very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's<br/>how you see Barney.
I'd like<br/>to start the service
with a passage<br/>from Ted's dream journal.
"drowning.
"gasping for air.
No escape."
wait, is that<br/>about Vietnam?
It's about whole foods.
Barney.
We are not
getting married.
And those aisles<br/>are too narrow!
But you two
have to get married...<br/>otherwise, it's just
a cheap, meaningless,<br/>disgusting one-night stand.
Wait, just to be clear,<br/>you're saying you're opposed
to cheap, meaningless,<br/>disgusting one-night stands?
Yes.
Barney... don't you see?
Your detox is done!
You're over one-night stands!
Oh, my God, you're right!
I'm free!<br/>Yeah.
So if you think about it...<br/>but not too much...
it's actually good that<br/>carly and I hooked up.
Yeah, it's really good.
I mean, this guy goes at it<br/>like he's still in his 50s.
Hey, have a cigar,<br/>you big crazy!
Hey, don't try<br/>to make this okay.
You still slept with my sister.
Promise me you will never,<br/>ever do that again.
I promise.
You just winked.
No, I didn't.
You did it again!<br/>No, I didn't!
You swear, right?
Yeah. Of course.
Hey.<br/>That night,
even though<br/>she still couldn't get a beer,
Robin realized<br/>the true power of the ring.
Hey, Robin.
Did you ever figure out<br/>how you're gonna get
a drink at the bar now<br/>that you're engaged?
Oh, sure. I know a way<br/>that's gonna last forever.
Scotch on the rocks?
Coming right up.
Now, before you say anything<br/>about the hat...
this new girl's ass<br/>is phenomenal!
Hey, Marshall,<br/>you got to see this.
The catalog must have<br/>mixed up my order.
You won't believe the jeans<br/>they just sent me.
Hilarious, right?
Totally.
You look like some
suburban mom<br/>who drives a minivan
filled with stale cheerios<br/>and empty juice boxes...
probably makes
chili Mac and<br/>frito pie for dinner...
smells like that menthol<br/>cigarette that she snuck while
she was waiting<br/>to pick her kids up
from hockey practice.<br/>Get over here!</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, sometimes when you're about...
to give up on your love life<br/>forever for the 17th time...
destiny intervenes.
Instead of rushing in...
I took my time to think up<br/>the perfect opening line.
Wait, no, damn it.<br/>Come back! You're really...
You're pretty!
And before I could call out after her in<br/>any kind of embarrassing way...
that a bunch of teenagers<br/>made fun of for the next five stops...
while I stared straight ahead<br/>and pretended not to hear them...
she was gone.
But here's the thing about Ted Mosby.<br/>He doesn't give up!
Stalker Ted alert.
- Repeat, stalker Ted alert.<br/>- Already has a yellow legal pad going.
Repeat, already has<br/>a yellow legal pad going.
I'm not stalking.
I just jotted down a few details<br/>to help me find her.
Uh, like the fact that her smile was cute,<br/>but a bit crooked...
which can be a sign of teeth grinding.
So I called up the city's<br/>top five T. M.J. Specialists...
and h-h-h-here's where<br/>it gets interesting.
Not interesting, Ted. Creepy. Let her go.
- No, this is destiny.<br/>- No, Ted, this is forcing it.
When Lily and I met,<br/>I mean, that was destiny.
She could've knocked on any door...
to find someone to fix her stereo...
but she knocked on mine.
Now hand over the pad.
And the backup pad.
They were right. You can't force destiny.
If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
And funny story, kids.
Oh, my God. It's you.
It happened.
Subway girl's name is Jeanette...
and she does grind her teeth.
I assume that started<br/>the moment she met you?
Uh, well, the fact is<br/>she wanted to find me.
The first thing I did was list out...
all the details I remembered about you.
Is that a yellow legal pad?
Yeah. I've even got a backup.
Oh, my God.
You had a tweed blazer<br/>and chalk all over your hands...
so I figured you were either<br/>a professor or a British gymnast.
I'm bloody good on the pommel 'orse.
Regrettin' this accent.
Can't seem to stop.
Then I asked the lady<br/>at the student center...
where I could find the youngest...
cutest professor on staff.
- And?<br/>- She sent me to a physics class.
Professor Leyborne?
I wonder if she'd think<br/>"Dr. Goodhair" was so cute...
if she knew he hasn't been<br/>published in over a year.
Then she sent me here...
but the security guard wouldn't<br/>let me in without an I.D.
I was about to give up<br/>when the fire alarm just sent you out.
- It was like...<br/>- Destiny.
Right? Right? It's a meet-cute.
It's a stalk-crazy.
Look, there's a fine line<br/>between love and insanity.
It's the Dobler-Dahmer theory.
Damn, I always forget the little one.
If both people are into each other...
a big romantic gesture works.
Like Lloyd Dobler<br/>holding up the boom box...
outside Diane Court's window<br/>in Say Anything.
But if one person isn't into the other...
the same gesture comes off<br/>serial-killer crazy, or Dahmer.
Now, Marshall...
the story of how you<br/>asked out Lily is super sweet.
♪ Lily, how you thrill me<br/>but it may just even kill me ♪
♪ If you do not say "I will-y"<br/>to this question ♪
♪ Will you go out with me? ♪ ♪
I will-y.
Dobler.
But if Lily wasn't into you?
♪ Lily, how you thrill me ♪
♪ But it might just even kill me ♪
♪ If you do not say "I will-y"<br/>to this question ♪
♪ Will you go out with me? ♪ ♪
Dahmer.
Whether a gesture's<br/>charming or alarming...
depends on how it's received...
and I was charmed by Jeanette finding me.
Hence, she's a Dobler.
Don't you think<br/>it's a little convenient...
how that fire alarm happened<br/>to randomly go off?
What are you saying?
- Ted, does she have enormous cans?<br/>- No.
Then what we're saying is she's a crazy<br/>stalker bitch who pulled that fire alarm.
- You should run screaming.<br/>- Guys, you know what?
L-I don't think that we should be so<br/>cavalier with the word "stalker."
- Why does that word bother you so much?<br/>- Doesn't bother me.
Wait. Do you have a stalker?
I don't want to talk about this.
As your fiancé...
if you have some psycho stalker out there,<br/>I should know.
It was me!<br/>I was a stalker. It was back in Canada.
I liked a guy and he didn't like me...
and, well, I got a little obsessed.
I'd fill up my journals all about him...
and eventually, there may have been a<br/>teensy-weensy 50-meter restraining order.
Fifty meters?
That's like... four years.
Wow.
You must have been a total nut bag.
I wasn't.<br/>Ted is right. There is a fine line.
Anyone can cross it and get obsessed.
Yeah, if you're a total nut bag.
Now, uh, who's the guy?
I'm not telling you until you admit that<br/>this can happen to anybody.
- I'm not admitting that.<br/>- Fine. Forget it. I'm not telling you.
Fine. Forgotten.
You are so beautiful.<br/>Why can't you see me?
Someday, I'll make you see me,<br/>and we'll be together.
P.S. I love you.
P.S. I love you. P.S. I love you.
P.S. I love you. P.S. I love you.
This is ridiculous.
Who cares who she was obsessed with?
What, am I gonna go to Canada<br/>and track this guy down?
Thankfully, unlike Uncle Barney...
I wasn't the kind of guy<br/>to fixate on one little detail.
That fire alarm, did you pull it?
This is embarrassing.
I wasn't gonna tell you this, but...
I'd come so far...
only to be sent packing<br/>by that security guard, and well...
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stand<br/>the idea of not meeting you.
Could not stand the idea<br/>of not meeting me.
Was it a little over the top<br/>to pull that fire alarm? Perhaps.
But it charmed me. Hence, Dobler.
Aha! You see?
People don't put fire alarms<br/>out in front lobbies...
for just anyone to prank pull.
They put smoke detectors up<br/>on the ceiling.
Hold on.
I'm beginning to think that you guys<br/>didn't come here to see my new lectern.
Are you implying Jeanette started a fire?
- Dahmer.<br/>- Dobler.
She's John Cusack. I'm lone Skye.
And there is nothing weird about that.
Gordie Bellavoh.
Thanks again for the free doughnuts, eh?
So, you up here visiting family?
No. I'm not Canadian.
Not even a quarter Canadian<br/>on my father's side. Shut up.
We're not talking "aboat" me... about me.
Whoa.
How long did you and Robin date?
Well, it wasn't really dating.
We'd take a sixer of Labatts<br/>behind the hydro plant...
and she'd let me go under parka,<br/>over turtleneck.
Summer love.
Was Robin obsessed with you?
No. No.
Robin was way more into this guy named...
Turk Grimsby.
I hear Robin was obsessed with you?
No. We only went out a few times,<br/>barely knew each other.
All we talked about<br/>was her relationship with her mother...
the gnawing feelings of inadequacy...
all the horrible secrets<br/>on that side of the family.
But heck, you're her fiancé.<br/>You know all that, right?
Yeah.
Robin was way more into this other guy.
Can't seem to remember his name.
Though sometimes a powdered jelly can help<br/>get the old noodle going.
Ah.
His name's...
Simon Tremblay. I should have known.
Eh. Thanks for the free doughnuts.
They're just doughnuts! Okay?
They're like two for a loonie... dollar.<br/>What's happening?
Oh! Somebody moosed down all the jellies.
Have you been hanging out<br/>with Turk Grimsby?
So how serious were you and Robin?
Well, serious enough to pop the question.
Wow. Really?
Yeah, sure.
Got down on one goalie pad.<br/>I said, "Robin...
could we keep dating,<br/>but I get to stick it to other babes?"
- Turned me down.<br/>- I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's okay. I really wanted<br/>to stick it to Louise Marsh.
Still, as the years pass<br/>and you take stock of your life...
part of me wishes I could've kept<br/>sticking it to Robin too.
So are you the one that Robin stalked?
Oh, that story goes back<br/>to the 1996 Grey Cup.
- What in God's name is that?<br/>- Only Canada's Super Bowl.
Underneath the Tunes on MuchMusic?
Again, I have to go with,<br/>"What in God's name is that?"
It's only Canada's VH1's Behind the Music.
There's one all about Robin Sparkles.
Tells you the whole story from "A" to zed.
Kids, relationships are built on trust.
So unlike Uncle Barney,<br/>I wasn't gonna keep digging and digging.
Did you start a fire?
This is embarrassing.
I wasn't gonna tell you this, but...
I'd come so far, only to be sent packing<br/>by that security guard...
and, well...
I'm sorry.
I just couldn't stand the idea<br/>of not meeting you.
Could not stand the idea<br/>of not meeting me.
She set a fire, Ted! Dahmer.
You're just jealous 'cause Lily never<br/>burned anything for you.
Clearly you never tried her pot roast.
I actually brought this<br/>for something different...
but it worked out, right?
Okay, anyway, here's my thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my back<br/>pocket the answer to the question...
"Who was Robin obsessed with?"
Hang on tight.
It's Robin Sparkles 4, y'all!
Shh! Shh!
With her jelly bracelets, graffiti coat...
and totally rad robot...
no one symbolized the 1990s<br/>in Canada like Robin Sparkles.
But as we'd all learn<br/>one heartbreaking Grey Cup Sunday...
Canada's sweetheart had a dark side.
I'll never forget that moment.
A little piece of Canada died that day.
To see her throw her life away<br/>like that...
it was heartbreaking.
I am so happy right now.
- I want to see her throw her life away so badly.<br/>- Yeah.
- We're all terrible people. Turn it up.<br/>- Yeah.
Sparkles's hit records<br/>"Let's Go to the Mall'...
and "Sandcastles in the Sand"<br/>both went maple...
with "Mall" eventually going double maple.
I never admitted this till now,<br/>but before a big game...
I'd listen to "Sand Castles in the Sand"<br/>and get a good cry on.
I'm not ashamed.
But after endless touring,<br/>Robin started to crack.
Who doesn't love the mall?
Shopping with your friends and...
I can't do this.
Get this out of my face, please.
Thank you. Pardon me. Thanks. Sorry.
Even when Canadians are mean,<br/>they're polite.
Her record producer,<br/>Chuck "Chuck" Gerussi.
Robin Sparkles was big...<br/>Gino Vannelli big.
Who I discovered by the way.
Robin's next song, "P.S. I Love You'...
was so dark, Dominant Records<br/>refused to release it.
Few have ever seen<br/>the long-lost music video...
but we found it.

In 1996, we booked<br/>the halftime show for the Grey Cup.
Huge gig. We're talkin'<br/>Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton...
just outside of Guelph.
It doesn't get any bigger than that.
Hello, Canada.
I'm Robin Sparkles.
Actually, I was Robin Sparkles.
The whole stadium went silent.
Right then, I knew something terrible<br/>was gonna happen.
My stomach started churning.
But Robin Sparkles is dead.
All I could hear was<br/>Paul Shaffer's stomach growling.
Stress goes to my stomach. Sue me.
It was kind of disgusting.
I'm sorry, Jason Priestley.
I didn't realize you were<br/>the Queen of England.
My new name is...
Robin Daggers! Two, three, four!
♪ Though you're beautiful ♪
That day is now known in music history...
as the day grunge was born.
In 1996, in Canada?<br/>That seems right, Trebek.
Give him a break. He's not a music guy.
That day is now known in music history...
as the day that grunge was born.
Well, that's a bummer.
It was tragic.
I mean, to this day...
you ask any Canadian where they were<br/>when Robin Sparkles lost it...
not only can they tell you<br/>which Tim Hortons they were in...
but what doughnut they were eating.
Me? Wawa, Ontario. Blueberry fritter.
Halifax, Nova Scotia. Walnut crunch.
Victoriaville, Quebec. Sour cream plain.
Sudbury, Ontario. Honey dip.
Red Deer, Alberta. Chocolate glaze.
Squamish, British Columbia.
Crammed a Timbit into a strawberry vanilla<br/>and invented The Priestley.
Should've been the best day of my life.
It was horrifying on so many levels.
Actually, you know what?
I'm sorry, I can't...<br/>I just can't talk about this.
I'm out of here, okay? I'm out of here.
Here, excuse me. I'm sorry.<br/>Will you take...
No, no, don't move. I'm out. Sorry, sorry.
Speculation began immediately.
Who was Robin Sparkles singing about<br/>with those angry, obsessive lyrics?
Many names were suggested.
- It wasn't me.<br/>- It wasn't me.
- Wasn't me.<br/>- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me.<br/>- It wasn't me.
Why does everyone always think... it's me?
I wish it was me.
But one name comes up more than any other.
Alan Thicke.
How can I help you? Doughnut?
Whoa.
What happened to you?
Underneath the Tunes today.
Wait, what?
You guys get MuchMusic down here?
And that video led me to...
I am engaged to Robin Scherbatsky...
and I know that she wrote<br/>"P.S. I Love You" for you.
Now-Now, why is she so obsessed with you?
What? That song's not about me.
Then who is it "aboot"? About! Damn it!
I don't know. I always<br/>thought it was Coulter.
It wasn't me. Stop asking.
Geez, cut it out.
I always liked that joke.
Alan Thicke kicked your ass.
He lied, didn't he? It was Alan Thicke!
Wow.
It sounds like you've<br/>become a bit obsessed, huh, Barney?
I am not obsessed.
All I did was break into your apartment<br/>and read your teenage journals...
and fly to Vancouver to interrogate<br/>your ex-boyfriends...
and fight beloved<br/>Canadian actor Alan Thicke... to a draw.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
So, ready to admit it?
Anyone can get obsessed.
Thank you.
And now, I am ready to tell you<br/>who "P.S. I Love You" is about.
Who?
P. S... Paul Shaffer.
Paul Shaffer?
I know. So stereotypical.
Every young Canadian girl...
fantasizes about being with Paul Shaffer.
At the Grey Cup gig,<br/>Paul was sitting in the front row.
♪ I'll always be waiting for you ♪
No wonder his stomach was growling.
I feel bad that I scared Paul.
He's amazing.
But I have no regrets.
I was done being Robin Sparkles.
You're not gonna go<br/>get beat up by Paul Shaffer now, are you?
I can't believe it. I'm a total Dahmer.
Yeah, but you're my Dahmer,<br/>which makes you a Dobler.
Just like Jeanette.
No! Ted, what that woman did to<br/>"run into you" was bonkers.
That's just not how you<br/>start a healthy relationship.
Tell him, Lil.
I can't stand it anymore.<br/>I've been living a lie.
See?
I saw you at orientation...
and I needed an excuse to meet you, so...
I didn't know which room you were in,<br/>so I had to create a little destiny.
Okay.
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stand<br/>the idea of not meeting you.
Could not stand<br/>the idea of not meeting me.
I'm sorry, Ted. You were right.
Jeanette's a Dobler. So are you.
- Thanks, buddy.<br/>- Hmm.
If you hadn't been reading<br/>the exact same book as me...
we never would've met.
I mean, that's destiny.
Oh, look. You bought it<br/>in the same bookstore I did.
On the same day.<br/>Within 10 minutes of me buying mine.
Uh, this is embarrassing.
I wasn't gonna tell you this...
but I followed you to that bookstore.
I just couldn't stand the idea<br/>of not meeting you.
You followed me<br/>to the bookstore from where?
H-How long have you been following me?
Uh, this is embarrassing.
Uh, remember when you were on<br/>the cover of New York Magazine?
That was, like, a year and a half ago.
Yeah.
Before a man meets<br/>the woman he'll marry...
he'll make one final, horrible mistake.
For me, that was Jeanette.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, early in this story,<br/>you may recall me saying
something along the lines of...
Okay, no more dating.
I am ready to settle down.
And at the time, I<br/>probably thought I meant it.
But, kids, I'll be honest.
Being single's fun.
As a young unattached<br/>man in New York City,
I had a great time.
A great time.
What was I saying? Oh, yeah.
I had such a great time<br/>that it took someone very special
to make me want to settle down.
And that someone...
was Jeanette.
What made Jeanette so special? Well...
That was a foul!
Jeanette was the last girl I dated
before I met your mother.
The girl who finally got me to say...
No more dating.
I'm ready to settle down.
and really mean it.
Oh!
But let's back up a little bit.
She broke your TV with a beer bottle?
In her defense, she was<br/>aiming for the window.
Dude, you gotta get rid of this girl.
Agreed. Cray-cray<br/>gotta go bye-bye
before you get stab-stabbed.
Oh, really?
And are you guys saying<br/>this because you don't want me
to be with Jeanette,<br/>or because you want me
to stay single so you<br/>guys can keep your clubhouse?
J'accuse!
I had a point,
and they knew it.
You see, in early 2013,
I was the only single guy in the group.
Which meant whenever<br/>Marshall or Barney bought something
they weren't allowed to<br/>keep in their apartments...
You know what, Ted? That reminds me.
I just bought this antique Swiss clock,
but Robin won't let us<br/>put it in the apartment,
so I was gonna leave it at your place.
Only problem? It's broken.
So I was just gonna sit<br/>here and try to fix it
while maybe you tell us what<br/>you and Jeanette did last night?
Okay. Well... Jeanette is<br/>a big Marilyn Monroe fan.
There you go! Now it's working!
Sorry. Sorry. Go on. Go<br/>on. She's a Marilyn Monroe fan
so I guess you<br/>watched one of her movies?
Uh, No, we had a s?ance.
Look at that! Good as new.
Anyway, were you able to contact Marilyn
in the spirit world?
No. We talked to her cat.
Screw loose! That's the problem.
Uh-oh.
Looks like somebody's hungry.
I'm gonna get his food ready.
Robin, can you grab him?
Can I? Try and stop me!
Now, kids, what Lily didn't realize...
what none of us<br/>realized, in fact... was that
in the eight months since<br/>your cousin Marvin was born,
Robin had never once held him.
The truth was, the thought of<br/>holding him terrified her,
so she had always avoided<br/>it, ever so discreetly.
Can you hold... Oh,<br/>shoot! Look at that!
Oh, geez.
I got him.
Come here, you little munchkin.
Aw, man...
Oh, well, I call next.
Well, I should go. It's<br/>time for Jeanette's... something.
Time for Jeanette's what, Ted?
Uh, we're taking her dog to an exorcist.
Wow, Ted, that sounds...
Crap, it's really broken now.
Okay, fine. I admit it. She's crazy.
Obviously.
But I'm not in this for the long haul.
It's just, you know, it's just fun.
Of course it's fun, at first.
But then when she starts<br/>calling out the name of her
high school science<br/>teacher in the throes of passion,
it's really fun.
But then when she<br/>starts bringing knives into bed
and making you fear for your safety?
It's really, really fun.
But then when she<br/>starts unbuttoning your pants
while you're being<br/>forced to drive blindfolded
down the freeway with<br/>a gun pointed at your...
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
Jeanette.
Oh, right. That girl's crazy.
You gotta break up with her. I know.
I know. You're right. I<br/>have to break up with her.
I should do it in a<br/>public place, though,
so she doesn't flip out.
So the next night, I<br/>met her in a public place
so she wouldn't flip out.
I will kill you, ref!
I will kill you in<br/>front of all these people!
Oh, boy. What, you think I won't
just 'cause I'm in a public place?
I'll go to jail for the<br/>rest of my life if I have to!
Listen, before the game<br/>starts, I think we need to talk.
I can't believe Ted's dead.
I know.
What a way to go.
Killed by a bazooka.
All right, all right, so<br/>I'm not on my game today.
Anyway...
I gotta hop out for a bit.
You guys stay here.
Oh, and... if Jeanette comes by,
do not let her into the apartment.
Don't let her in. Got it.
Guys, this is serious. This<br/>girl is like bedbugs.
Once she's in the<br/>apartment, there's no getting her out.
Ted, buddy,
how long have we been dealing
with Barney's<br/>insane girlfriends? Years.
Nigh on a decade!
I had to testify in<br/>five competency hearings.
I think we can handle Jeanette.
Okay, okay.
See you soon.
That kid. Am I right?
Now look who forgot his keys.
What is it?
Meanwhile, Lily and<br/>Robin were out getting lunch,
when disaster struck.
Oh, God, I left his binky on that bus!
Wait. Don't you have other binkies?
That one's his favorite!<br/>He'll know the difference!
I'm not gonna let this be the reason
he resents me later in life!
If he starts crying, just pick him up!
What? Uh...
Okay, okay. Yeah, there,<br/>there, there. Okay.
Hey, I'm back. Did I miss anything?
Nope.
Did Jeanette come by?
Jeanette? I know lots of Jeanettes.
Um...
Guys! Okay, she came by
because she forgot her book.
So we let her go up in<br/>your room and get it.
And then?
And then what?
And then she left?
I think she left.
Are you sure she left?
I am... 90% sure...
that she left.
80 percent.
Actually, I'm gonna change my answer.
I am now starting to<br/>think she never left,
and instead she<br/>barricaded herself in your room.
And I'm never coming out!
A hundred percent.
I cannot believe you guys!
Well, maybe if you had given<br/>us a warning that she was crazy!
Dude, it's okay.
She can't stay in there forever.
She'll have to come out to eat and drink
and go to the bathroom, right?
Now, a few months earlier,
the East Coast had<br/>been hit by a bad storm,
and some intelligent, forward-thinking
New Yorkers took it as a wake-up call,
making sure to stock their<br/>bedrooms with enough
food and water to last months,
not to mention a portable<br/>waste management system.
It was really the smart thing to do.
You dumbass!
Really, Ted. How could you<br/>be so unbelievably stupid?
No, no, you guys are<br/>the ones who invited
a vampire into my apartment!<br/>This is your fault!
And P.S., if this disaster
had been a superstorm instead<br/>of a hot lunatic,
you'd all be begging to eat<br/>my freeze-dried protein paste
and crap in my biohazard<br/>bucket. Just sayin'.
I got it.
It was on the floor of the bus.
I should probably throw it out. Eh.
Did he give you any problems?
He cried a little, but then he stopped.
Oh, good. Anything else happen?
Nope.
That... is... it.
All gone!
We have to do this more often.
Oh, we totally do.
I can't believe<br/>Marvin's in kindergarten.
He's growing up so fast.
Can I confess something to you?
Remember the day you<br/>left Marvin's binky on the bus
and you left me alone with him? Yeah.
Well, I didn't tell you<br/>this at the time, but...
Okay, okay. Yeah, there, there, there.
Okay, shh, shh.
Oh, no, it looks<br/>like somebody's not happy.
No kidding. I'm miserable.
Listen to this thing.
He probably just wants to be held.
I think you're right.
Can you do it?
All right.
Come here, handsome. Oh. Yeah.
Yes.
Oh.
I let a stranger pick<br/>up Marvin. I'm sorry.
It's just, I hadn't<br/>actually picked him up
at that point, and I was scared, so...
You know what? It was four years ago.
He's obviously fine. Don't<br/>even worry about it.
Really? Yeah.
Thank you.
I mean, as long as<br/>there's not more to that story.
Nope. That... is... it.
Jeanette, you have to leave!
In a minute!
I still haven't found that book!
Listen, Jeanette, I<br/>didn't want to do this,
but I called the<br/>police. They're on their way.
All units, all units.
Possible 10-90 in progress
at 521 West 82nd, apartment 15.
Where's that coming from?
Is that you, Dolores?
Jeanette? Hey, girl. How you been?
Oh, you know, I'm just doing me.
Anyway, I'll check out that 10-90.
Okay, but remember...
I know, no excessive force.
Last thing I need is<br/>another suspension, am I right?
And that, kids, was how I found out
what Jeanette did for a living.
Wait a second.
Is she a cop?
I think she's a cop!
Did you know she was a cop?
I didn't know she was a cop!
Ted, I'm sorry I have to say<br/>this... Jeanette lives here now.
This is her place. You're<br/>gonna have to leave.
What?
Why don't you have to leave?
They can stay.
Thank you, Officer<br/>Jeanette. Thank you, Officer Jeanette.
All gone.
We need to do this more often.
We totally do. I can't believe
Marvin's in middle school.
Oh, he's growing up so fast.
Can I confess something to you?
Remember that day you<br/>left Marvin's binky
on the bus and I let that<br/>old lady pick him up?
I seem to recall that<br/>was the entire story.
There's a little bit more.
There, there, little one.
Let's put you back in your strolly-poo,
so you can drift off<br/>to dreamy-dreamy land.
Oh, thank you so much.
Yeah, this is my first<br/>time alone with him,
and, you know... I have<br/>this weird feeling that I'm gonna,
I don't know, like, drop<br/>him or injure him in some way,
which is completely insane.
But... Oh, heavens.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I know, I'm so sorry.
Well, you know what?
That was what, 12 years ago?
Don't even worry about it.
Really? Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Just promise me there's<br/>no more to that story.
Nope, that is it.
Are you sure you want to do this?
The girl's a cop.
Yeah, this seems like a really bad idea.
I don't care.
I am going into that bedroom
because this is my home
and I have to defend it.
But mostly because
my allergy medication
is in there!
All right, just be careful, okay?
This girl is really crazy.
Yeah, why can't she just accept<br/>the fact that you guys broke up?
I know, I know, why<br/>can't she just accept that?
Why, it's, like, why?
It might be because we<br/>didn't actually break up.
Aw, man.
Jeanette, come on, that's vintage vinyl.
Ted, did you or didn't you break up
with Jeanette last night?
I don't know, it's kind of confusing.
I think we need to talk.
Oh, oh, okay.
I see where this is going.
You're in love with Lily.
That's it, isn't it?
What? No, I...
Like I should be surprised with<br/>her fancy medical degree
and her sexy Southern drawl.
What? She's not...
Don't talk to me, don't look at me.
I hate you and I never<br/>want to see you again!
And then things got crazy
and we got thrown out<br/>of the Barclays Center.
I don't know, it felt pretty breakup-y.
Mm. Anyway,
we parted on pretty bad terms, so...
I kind of thought maybe I could...
Never contact her<br/>again and hope she'd take
the hint and just leave you alone?
Barney, give me some credit.
Was that the plan? Yes.
All gone. We need to do this more often.
We totally do.
I can't believe Marvin's in high school.
He's growing up so fast.
Can I confess something<br/>to you? Oh, no. What?
What happened?
Tell me what you did to my son.
This is not going well at all.
Oh, honey, you are shaking.
Let's get you out of the cold.
What's open near here?
You took my infant<br/>child to a strip club?
It was just topless.
He saw yours all the time anyway.
Okay, I'm sorry, I<br/>shouldn't have done that,
but that is all there is.
Okay, there is no more to the story.
I have now told you everything.
All gone.
We need to do this more<br/>often. We totally do.
I can't believe Marvin's driving.
He's growing up so fast.
Okay, there's one other thing.
What?
Well, I have to go use the ladies' room.
Can you watch him for me?
Of course.
I could just eat you up.
You left him with a complete stranger?
He could've been...
Robin, how could you? Lily,
please, okay, it was 16 years ago.
He's fine.
You're right.
It's fine.
God, it feels so good to<br/>have gotten this off my chest.
Finally it is all on the table.
All secrets are exposed<br/>and there is nothing left
to be revealed.
All gone. We need to do this more...
There's more to the<br/>story. Damn it, Robin.
What could you possibly have left out?
It's just there's...
one little detail that I<br/>may have slightly altered.
If he starts crying, just pick him up.
Yeah, there, there.
Come on, buddy, shh.
Looks like somebody's unhappy.
No kidding, I'm miserable.
Listen to this thing.
Maybe he needs to be held.
I think you're right.
Can you do it?
Sure.
Come here, handsome.
Come here, come here, you<br/>handsome devil, you.
You're such a beautiful...
Aw, you're such a cool dude.
Oh, look at you, oh.
All right, there, there,<br/>little one, there, there.
Let me put you back in your strolly-poo
so you can drift off<br/>to dreamy-dreamy land.
Okay? All right.
Thank you so much.
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's my first time alone with him,
and I just have this weird feeling
I'm gonna drop him
or injure him in some way.
I know it's completely insane...
Oh, heavens, oh, watch it, no!
No!
This is not going well at all.
Oh, hon, you're shaking.
Let's get out of the cold.
Is there anything open near here?
Hey, I need to go to the<br/>ladies' room... can you watch him for me?
Of course. I could just eat you up.
Look at you, yum, yum, yum, yum.
You waited 17 years to tell me
that you met the greatest<br/>boxer of all time?
My son was rocked to<br/>sleep by Senator Mike Tyson?
I wanted to tell you,<br/>believe me. How could you...?
Okay, this is the right thing to do.
You got to go up there and<br/>break up with her for real.
And don't worry, if anything happens,
just scream, we'll come rescue you.
Okay.
Did you guys not hear<br/>me screaming up there?
Aw, I feel so awful.
We went to get subs.
We got you one though.
We didn't get you one.
So, Jeanette's squatting in your room?
What are you guys doing here?
We heard you screaming<br/>from three blocks away.
Why is she in there?
Lily, there is no reason why.
That's like asking why<br/>is the earth round?
Why does the sun come<br/>up in the morning?
What do I do for a living?
There are some questions we're<br/>not meant to know the answer to.
Crazy girls are crazy<br/>because they're crazy.
I don't think it's quite that simple.
I was talking
to a friend of mine about<br/>Ted and Jeanette.
Oh, great, what friend is this?
Uh, just this wise old lady that I know.
Here's the thing about crazy.
When a guy sends<br/>mixed signals to a girl,
it takes a toll on her psychological<br/>well-being.
You want to know why a girl acts crazy,
look at the guy she's dating.
Then you really see some crazy.
Trust me.
Are you Mike Tyson?
Now, hold on.
I've dated tons of<br/>crazy girls in my life,
and not once have I ever<br/>treated them with anything other than...
Oh, right, I'm a monster.
Maybe the old lady with<br/>the face tattoo is right.
Maybe the reason<br/>Jeanette's acting this way
is Ted.
Me? How is this my fault?
Yeah, come on, this is<br/>Ted we're talking about.
I'm sure he didn't do<br/>anything to lead her on
or send mixed signals, right, Ted?
Don't talk to me, don't look at me.
I hate you and I never<br/>want to see you again!
And we got thrown out<br/>of the Barclays Center.
Okay, that's disappointing.
So disappointing.
Seriously.
But that was last<br/>night. I mean, it's not like...
Listen, Jeanette, we really need
to have a serious talk about our...
So, did Lily leave these boots here
or was it some other bitch?
Marshall, Barney, help me!
I don't think they're coming.
I guess not.
It's those red boots.
They just look sexy on everyone.
Okay, Ted, what is with the red boots?
You're a smart guy, you've<br/>got some taste,
you got a visual sense, I mean,
you're an architect for Pete's sakes.
How can you look at those<br/>boots and think...
Oh, my God, I'm holding<br/>it, I'm holding the baby.
What, you've never held him before?
Uh, tons of times.
This-this is not a big moment for me.
This is exhilarating.
Look, yes, I know what you're gonna say.
I have to break up with her. No,
I was actually gonna say the opposite.
I think you need to be<br/>with Jeanette right now.
Because she's the one.
No. What? No.
She's insane.
But I think you are also<br/>a little insane right now.
So I think you need to go
be with your crazy girl for a<br/>while and when it all goes down
in flames... and I don't<br/>mean that figuratively,
I expect there to be actual flames...
And there were.
we'll be here for<br/>you because we love you.
Jeanette I just want to say that...
you going through my stuff like that...
You are really something special.
I'm gonna send Lily a<br/>dead animal in the mail.
I think I'm falling for you.
I think we should have a<br/>three-way with my therapist.
He's 70.
What is your ring size?
Robin.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Really?
Yeah, you sure you don't want to just
put him in the crib<br/>and, you know, go home?
No, I'm good.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
What's that smell?
Lily! Lily!
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Thanks.
That's weird. I have a message.
That's weird.
You still have an answering machine.
Ted, this is the Captain.
Please call me back at<br/>your earliest convenience.
Oh, crap.
Kids, you remember the Captain.
He was one of the<br/>richest men in New York,
and when I met him, he<br/>was married to Zoey,
who I ended up... befriending.
- Oh, man, he seems pissed.<br/>- Does he?
Yes. Listen.
Ted, this is the Captain.
Please call me back at<br/>your earliest convenience.
Oh, I hear it now.
What? I don't know.
Listen again.
Ted, this is the Captain.
Please call me back at<br/>your earliest convenience.
He sounds pissed.
Yeah, and I think I know why.
It has to do with the<br/>last time I saw him.
It was... it was,<br/>like, a year and a half ago.
Oh, boy, that was a crazy story.
Oh, boy, yeah.
I remember.
You weren't there.
Ted, bubbeleh.
If you have a crazy story, I was there.
That's just a law of the universe.
So what happened?
Well, it was a few weeks
after Zoey and I broke<br/>up, and I was on the rebound,
and I kind of rekindled<br/>things with that girl, Becky.
- Becky?<br/>- Boats, boats, boats.
Boats, boats, boats!
Boats!
What's this a commercial for again?
I can't quite...
Boats, boats, boats!
Oh, get a room, you two.
- You weren't there.<br/>- I was, too.
All right, you were<br/>there? Tell me the story.
I like the way you tell it.
Please, I insist.
Okay, we'll tell it together.
Okay.
- Lily...<br/>- Lily...
- had invited us...<br/>- had invited us...
- to an art...<br/>- Garfunkel concert.
gallery opening.
An Art Garfunkel gallery<br/>opening concert.
Go on, Ted. You're doing great.
Anyway, I get to the gallery...
This place is so fancy.
I hope I don't embarrass myself.
What? Lily, come on.
You got nothing to be embarrassed about.
Dude, look who it is.
And who should walk in but...
Daddy's home.
Nope.
Well, well, Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.
What are you doing here?
Um, well... Lily saw an ad for this...
Gallery?
So we... we came to check out the...
Artwork.
And then we ran into...
Me.
Man, this guy's so rude.
I mean, I get why he's mad.
I did stick it to his<br/>ex-wife... repeatedly.
Still, he's being a jerk.
Someone needs to bring him down a peg.
I'm sorry. Where are my...
Manners.
That's how that feels.
This is my art consultant.
Shelly.
Art consultant? What's that?
Oh, Shelly helps the Captain
select artwork based<br/>on its aesthetic appeal
and value as an investment.
That's why I think she's<br/>gonna love this elephant painting.
I think this artist is going places.
Well, I should go.
Captain, we'll talk tomorrow?
At ease.
Hey, if you like art,
you should see the<br/>painting I just acquired.
It's in my apartment just upstairs.
It's gonna blow you away.
Anyone with this kind of ashtray money
probably has an<br/>island where he hunts people.
Probably somewhere in the Caribbean.
I bet there's good snorkeling.
Hello, my darling, my one<br/>true love, my everything.
So, who wants to see that painting?
Okay, Captain, we know why you<br/>brought us up here. It's...
it's about me and Zoey.
Ted,
if you've got something to say,
say it.
A harpoon gun?
A double-barreled harpoon gun.
- One barrel.<br/>- With a scope.
No scope.
I know you're upset,<br/>Captain, but I promise you
nothing happened between me and Zoey<br/>until after you guys split up, okay?
So let's...
Let's please, just-just-just<br/>put this down.
Okay? Okay, oh, there we go.
Look, Ted,
I'm not mad at you.
The truth is I'm in love with somebody<br/>else now, so we're fine.
Just don't steal this<br/>one from me, too, okay?
Okay?
Of course.
- I promise.<br/>- Okay.
But that got me thinking.
Who was this new lady in his life?
I had this weird sinking feeling.
We both did.
I had to see that picture.
So I waited until everyone
was out of the room, and then...
- Boats, boats, boats!<br/>- No.
No...!
She's "boats, boats,<br/>boats," and he's the Captain.
That's sweet, I'm happy for those two.
Ted, you suck.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
It's him, it's him. What do I do?
- What do I do?<br/>- Ted, wait a second.
- What do I do?<br/>- Wait a second. Wait a second!
Hey, is there any<br/>chance that he is calling
to invite the three<br/>of us out on his boat?
Uh, I don't know, maybe<br/>like one percent.
Ted's phone. Hold for Ted.
Hello.
Ted, I'm gonna ask you something,
and I want you to be completely honest.
What's your friend Robin's number?
What?
Ted, ask about the boat.
Uh, Captain, can...<br/>can I put you on hold?
Affirmative.
He wants Robin's number.
Should I give it to him?
Is he trying to hook<br/>up with my fianc?e?
No, uh-uh.
The only way that's happening is<br/>if I get to hook up with someone, too.
Wait a second... No.
Unless... Absolutely not.
However... Forget it. On<br/>the other hand... Ixnay!
Guys, guys, I got to<br/>make a decision here.
Okay, you know what, I say do it.
If it is a booty call, then<br/>Robin will just let him down easy,
but in the meantime, Ted is<br/>back on the Captain's good side.
We all get to go out on<br/>his boat, I get to steer it.
Everybody wins.
Okay.
Fine. Give him her number.
- You don't think she'll mind?<br/>- I don't think she'll mind.
You gave the Captain my number?
She minds.
Do you not remember that night we<br/>hung out with him at the art show?
Oh, right, of course you don't remember<br/>because, earlier that night,
you shared a big, fat<br/>sandwich with Becky.
Boats, boats, boats!
What's this a commercial for again?
Yeah, so?
I hardly think that changes the story.
Mmm. Mmm.
Delicious!
This place is so fancy.
I hope I don't embarrass myself.
Oh, come on, Lily.
You got nothing to be embarrassed about.
Dude, look who's here.
Daddy's home.
- Nope.<br/>- Nope.
Well, well.
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.
What are you doing here?
Well, Lily...
saw an ad for this...
Gallery.
So we thought we'd...
come and check out the...
Artwork?
And then we ran into...
Me?
And the Captain wasn't glaring at you.
He couldn't take his eyes off...
Hey, nice to see you again.
Yeah, you, too.
Oh.
Man, this guy is so rude.
I mean, I get why he's upset.
I did stick it to his<br/>ex-wife... repeatedly.
Still, the guy's being a jerk.
Someone needs to take him down a peg.
Sorry.
Where are my manners?
This is Shelly, my art consultant.
Art consultant? What's that?
Shelly helps the Captain select artwork
based on aesthetic...<br/>- Manners!
That's how that feels.
appeal
and value as an investment,
and that's why I think she's gonna<br/>love this elephant painting.
I think this artist is going places.
Well, I should go.
Captain, we'll talk tomorrow.
If you like art,
you should see the<br/>painting I just acquired.
It's gonna blow you away.
Snorkeling.
Then, after I saved you from destroying
a priceless crystal ashtray...
You're welcome.
Hello, my darling,
my one true love, my everything.
Ahoy?
So who wants to see that painting?
Okay, Captain.
We all know why you brought us up here.
This is about me and...
Zoey.
All right, Ted.
If you've got something to say,
say it.
Whoa, whoa.
- A remote control?<br/>- A remote control.
Let's relax.
I know you're upset, Captain.
I just... I want to assure you
nothing happened between me and Zoey
until after you guys had split up.
So let's just... let's<br/>just... let's put this down.
Okay, okay.
There we go.
Ted, I'm not mad at you.
Truth is, I'm in love<br/>with somebody else now.
So he invited me back to his bedroom
to show me this painting, and...
Finally.
We're alone.
Robin, no, I don't want
to picture that.<br/>- Nothing happened.
- Aw, that means hand stuff.<br/>- What?
No.
I'm serious... he was on the rebound.
I told him to take some time<br/>to pull himself together and...
call me in a year and a half.
Ah, great.
What if he asks you out?
What does that mean for<br/>our relationship?
What, are we planning to<br/>be in some super-enlightened,
forward-thinking marriage,
where we don't get<br/>hung up on the suffocating
and outdated principles of monogamy,
and instead enjoy the<br/>company of multiple partners,
sometimes bringing said partners<br/>into our marital bed,
but just girls, not dudes,
except maybe one time<br/>just to see what that's like?
I mean, is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Me, neither!
Okay, Robin, look, you-you<br/>need to call the Captain
and let him down easy, okay?
Let him move on with his life.
Let him go out on his<br/>boat with his old friends,
maybe some new friends.
Maybe let one of those new<br/>friends steer the boat.
Just so that one of them could say,
"Iceberg straighthead!"
Fine.
Ahoy.
Hi. Captain, it's Robin.
Ahoy.
Uh, look,
I... have to be upfront with you.
I'm engaged.
Engaged? I thought you<br/>were married to Marshall.
This is Robin right?
The redheaded kindergarten teacher
who wore the gray<br/>dress and the blue shoes
to that art show?
Can you please hold a moment?
Dropping anchor.
He's looking for Lily.
Should I give him her number?
Yeah. We've already discussed it.
It's $4 million cash.
Oh, her phone number. Yes,<br/>I don't think she'll mind.
You gave the Captain my number?
She minds.
It finally happened.
My past finally caught up with me.
Oh, God.
Lily, if you tell me that you
slept with the Captain<br/>for anything under 2.8,
which we agreed was as<br/>low as we were going to go...
No, it's nothing like that.
Do you guys remember the last<br/>time we saw the Captain?
- Yes.<br/>- Oh, right.
Of course you don't. Barney,<br/>you weren't there.
Ted, you had just floated<br/>out of a Snoop Dogg B-side.
And, Robin, you had just come<br/>from that big meeting that ran long.
Delicious. Shrimpy for me.
This place is so fancy.
I hope I don't embarrass myself.
Come on, Lily, you have<br/>nothing to be embarrassed about.
Dude! Look who's here!
Daddy's...
- Nope.<br/>- Nope.
Well, well.
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.
Hello, sailor.
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, yeah, that's what happened.
This is Shelly, my art consultant.
Art consultant!
What's that?
Shelly helps the Captain select artwork
based on its aesthetic appeal<br/>and its value as an investment,
which is why I think she's<br/>gonna love this elephant painting.
I think this artist is going places.
You'd have to be a real<br/>Dumbo not to enjoy this painting.
Get it?
'Cause he's an elephant?
Your sense of humor is as<br/>good as your taste in art.
Captain?
We'll talk tomorrow?
If you like art,
you should see the<br/>painting I just acquired.
- It's in my...<br/>- Manners.
That's how that feels.
In my apartment right upstairs.
It's gonna blow you away.
Snorkeling.
Then, after I saved you from destroying
a priceless crystal ashtray...
You're welcome.
Hello, my darling, my one<br/>true love, my everything.
So, who wants to see that painting?
Ooh, if you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.
So we check out the painting.
Huh. You know,
that elephant painting<br/>would look nice in here.
You're looking at a masterpiece,
and you're talking about<br/>some elephant painting?
No...!
Oh, this one's nice, too.
I just like the<br/>elephant painting better.
You know, it doesn't<br/>matter what you like.
You're just a kindergarten teacher.
Ah, finally we're alone.
Oh, no, Lily, what did you do?
He was a jerk... he deserved to<br/>have that precious painting stolen.
Oh, God, Lily, you didn't...?
Of course I didn't.
I stole this ashtray instead.
- Lily!<br/>- Hey, you know the rules.
You misbehave, I take<br/>away one of your toys.
Aldrin Justice, baby.
So you're telling me that that ashtray
that's been in our<br/>apartment for over a year and a half
is not only stolen, but<br/>also very expensive.
Both of those things... yes.
Guys, can you leave us<br/>alone for a minute, please?
- Ooh, they're gonna do it.<br/>- No, we're gonna fight.
And then maybe afterwards we'll do it.
I can't believe that<br/>was the same ashtray.
I should've recognized it.
I know... me, too.
Barney, you weren't there.
Why is it so important<br/>that you be part of this story?
Because crazy stories are my thing.
You have<br/>architecture, Marshall has the law,
Lily has art,
Robin has pleasing me sexually.
You all have a passion that drives you.
Well, if I have a<br/>passion, it's taking life
and turning it into a series<br/>of crazy stories.
If you can do that without me, then...
I don't even know who I am anymore.
You know what, Barney?
Now that I think about it,
you were there.<br/>- That's right, you were.
- I was?<br/>- Yeah.
I mean, I know I was.
That's what I'm saying, guys.
We just... we just<br/>didn't realize it because...
you were in disguise.
Yeah, you were doing...
one of your plays from the playbook.
On Shelly, the art consultant.
Yes, it was... some<br/>play that had to do with art...
The Royal Archduke of Grand Fenwick?
A simple play you can do using<br/>two everyday household objects...
a Prussian military costume<br/>and an oil painting of yourself?
That's the one, and it worked on Shelly.
I totally nailed her!
And then I nailed her<br/>sister who was even hotter.
Good times.
You are gonna return that ashtray,<br/>and you're gonna pray
that he doesn't press<br/>charges, because I can't be
in a marriage where one<br/>of us is in prison.
I know that we<br/>role-play conjugal visits a lot,
but I can't do that for realsies.
I'm sorry... all rulings are final.
I am not taking it back.
Oh, my God!
Lily,
what is the big deal?
Okay, so what?
So he said you're just<br/>a kindergarten teacher.
- Why do you let that bother you?<br/>- Because he was right.
I am just a kindergarten teacher.
And, yes, I have a degree
in art history and I was<br/>meant to do something with it,
but I didn't.
Somewhere along the line,
I forgot to pursue my dream, and...
and now I'm old and I'm a mom<br/>and it's just too late for me.
Lily, okay, okay.
- It's too late.<br/>- No, no, no, it's not too...
it's not too late.
You're gonna quit your job tomorrow,
and you're gonna... you're<br/>gonna go back and pick up
right where you left<br/>off with that art stuff.
And then you know what?
I'm gonna find Shelly, and<br/>I'm gonna punch her in the face.
I am... I'm gonna punch a girl...
and run away.
Look.
I promise you,
your best and your most exciting days
are all ahead of you.
I love you so much for saying that,
but there gets to be a point in life
where that just stops being true.
I'm sorry I stole this.
I'll return it first thing tomorrow.
And so the next day, Lily returned
to the Captain's apartment.
Well, how about that.
I didn't even realize it was gone.
No harm done.
Wait, if you weren't<br/>calling about the ashtray,
then why'd you want to see me?
Follow me.
Oh, my gosh.
Yep, that night, I ducked back down
into the gallery and bought it.
Shelly didn't stop you?
Shelly was off with some archduke<br/>she met at the party.
No, I just... well,
I liked what you said about<br/>how you just liked it.
I still do.
Me, too.
Anyway, I just sold it for $4 million.
What?
In the year and a half since<br/>I bought this piece,
the artist has turned into a<br/>huge star in the art world.
The next Basquiat, they're saying.
And nobody saw it coming except you.
So I've decided to give you half<br/>my earnings from the sale.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not giving you two million bucks.
I mean, I could.
Easily... it wouldn't<br/>even make a dent for me.
But trust me, the tax<br/>code being what it is,
you do not want to be rich right now.
So here's what I'm thinking.
I want to get back in the art game,
and I need a new art consultant.
Wait, are you offering me a job?
If you want it.
What do you say?
And she said yes. Guys, it was amazing!
- You should have been there.<br/>- Barney!
- Let her tell her story.<br/>- You were not there.
Guys!
What did you say, baby?
I said yes.
Ha! Told you!
How would I know that<br/>she was going to say...?
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">This is the life.
We got the three B's.
Beach, booze and bodacious babes.
I don't know.
I'm starting to think<br/>we should call the police.
Oh, would you relax?
We've got it made.
One whole week at his<br/>bodacious beach house,
no strings attached.
Well, there is one string attached.
Hi, Barney.
Bodacious.
"Weekend at Barney's!"
What is it? What's wrong?
The plays, Robin, the plays.
The ingenious<br/>techniques I used as a bachelor
to pick up busty dullards.
They just keep coming to<br/>me, I can't turn them off.
Okay, Barney, let me<br/>ease your mind, okay?
All right, here we go.
Remember when you set<br/>your Playbook on fire?
That was the moment I realized<br/>you were someone I could marry.
And I'd burn it again if I could.
You're right.
I'm done with all these plays.
Besides, there's no<br/>way I'll ever come up
with anything that tops<br/>"Weekend at Barney's".
"Weekend at Barney's Two!"
Damn it, Barney!
So, there's this big<br/>gallery opening tonight.
Oh, we'd love to, but<br/>we've got this...
Genesis reunion, Madison Square Garden,
front row. It's gonna be legend...<br/>- I wasn't inviting you guys.
Oh, thank God. There is no concert.
As the captain's new art buyer,
I have to go schmooze<br/>this up-and-coming artist,
Strickland Stevens,
so we get first dibs<br/>on all his new stuff.
And I'll be helping Lily seal the deal<br/>by impressing the intelligentsia
with some art-related hilarity.
I've prepared some jokes.
Why couldn't the art<br/>dealer pay his rent?
- I don't know. Why?<br/>- This is gonna be rough.
Because he ran out of Monet.
You're gonna get that on the walk<br/>home. How about this one?
You know what, we'd...<br/>we'd love to hear it,
but we've got that... that...
Steely Dan, Carnegie Hall,<br/>backstage pass. Let's go.
We don't want to miss<br/>whatever their big song was.
Yeah.
Your wedding response card, as promised.
Why didn't you just mail<br/>it like everybody else?
Oh, see, that's sad, Robin.
You should be touched<br/>that I hand-delivered it.
Has social media so eroded<br/>our interpersonal relationships
that we no longer wish<br/>to experience the...
- You wanted to keep the stamp?<br/>- They're 46 cents now.
It's getting out of hand.
"Your invitation is joyfully accepted
by Mr. Ted Mosby and Jeanette.
Kids, as you'll recall,
Jeanette was the last girl I dated<br/>before I met your mother.
My friends only had<br/>one tiny problem with her.
She was nuts.
So you're bringing a plus one?
If you count the voices in her head,
it's plus five.
Guys, I'm bringing her,
and you're gonna love having her there.
Oh, and... by the way,
just so this doesn't turn<br/>into an argument later,
the dress she's gonna wear isn't<br/>technically white, it's eggshell.
The shoes are white, though.
And the gloves.
And the veil. Well, see you guys.
- No, no, no.<br/>- Mosby! Get...
Oh, my God, what happened?
Oh, I trashed your apartment.
See, I got bored,
so I started going<br/>through all your e-mails.
- Sure.<br/>- And I found one from a woman
with the subject line,<br/>"big penis orgasms,"
so naturally, I smashed your plates,
knifed your mattress,<br/>peed in your drawers,
the whole nine, but then,
while I was upper-decking your toilet,
I actually read the e-mail.
Turns out it was spam.
Classic Jeanette, huh?
Oh, my God.
You are certifiably insane...
about me.
Come here, you knucklehead.
- I can't stay mad at you.<br/>- Ted, Ted, I'm breaking up with you.
You're just so intense,
and it's all moving way too fast.
Here's your key back.
I never gave you a key.
And here's your grandmother's ring.
She was buried wearing this.
And just like that,
it was over.
I texted Barney and Robin.<br/>I'm sure they're over the moon
that Jeanette's not coming<br/>to the wedding.
Oh, no, Ted, no.
They're not gonna be<br/>happy about you being sad.
They broke up!
Ted, respectfully,
are you sure that this was<br/>the right girl for you?
Of course not.
She was crazy.
Absolutely a nightmare.
It's totally not worth the trouble.
I mean, no matter how...
no matter how great the sex was.
- Uh-oh. -<br/>Stay with us, buddy.
No matter how hot and passionate
and surprising,
possibly illegal...
- I don't like this.<br/>- Me, neither.
I'm gonna win her back.
Barney and Robin are<br/>gonna be so happy I'm happy.
I know.
I know.
Did you just unhook my bra?
Shh. There, there.
That night was the big gallery show.
Hey. I'm so sorry.
I decided to grab a snack<br/>from the bodega.
Why? They'll have food at the gallery.
Oh, come on, these places<br/>never have food.
It's fine.
I got some Skittles.
That was the last bag of Skittles
your Uncle Marshall would ever buy.
Meanwhile, I headed over<br/>to Jeanette's place
to win her back.
What the hell?
I can't let you do this, Ted.
I want Jeanette back.
Well, then accept my apology.
For what?
This.
Ow, ow, ow! Damn it! You're strong.
That's just from Pilates?
Twice a week.
Look, I don't want you<br/>getting back with Jeanette.
Ted, what is my one rule?
You can tell how old a<br/>girl is by her elbows?
My other one rule.
Flaxseed relieves upset stomach?
My other one rule.
Always have a fake pair<br/>of concert tickets
in your pocket in case Lily<br/>invites you to something stupid?
My other one rule.
Lebanese girls sprint to third<br/>base and then stay there?
- My other one rule.<br/>- New is always better.
New is always better!
Exactly, Ted.
You want to invite a date to our wedding,<br/>it is not gonna be Jeanette.
It is gonna be someone new.
And I am gonna help you find her
with a little help from...
The Playbook.
The Playbook? Didn't you burn that?
Oh, I didn't burn the real one.
That was the ceremonial playbook
for parades,
mall openings,
inaugurations, stuff like that.
That's a pretty big secret<br/>to keep from Robin.
Which is exactly why I'm trusting you,
my best bro, to never let her know
that the Playbook still exists.
Pinky swear?
Fine.
Wow.
See, I told you.
Thank God I snuck in<br/>this bag of goodness.
There's Strickland Stevens.
Wow.
Even his scarf<br/>is up-and-coming.
Are you gonna be okay by yourself<br/>for a few minutes?
Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Well, you're sitting<br/>on an $80,000 sculpture.
For 80 grand,
you'd think it<br/>would be more comfortable.
Lil, I'll be fine.
Do you know who you're talking to?
In high school, I<br/>was voted most outgoing
freshman, sophomore and senior year.
What happened junior year?
Egdud Ferhaki,
that outgoing son of a bitch.
He beat you for most outgoing?
Huh? Oh, no, we tied.
Look, the point is, I can make<br/>friends anywhere, even here.
- Thanks, baby.<br/>- You got it.
Hey, excuse me.
Listen.
Do you think that you would enjoy a show
featuring Donatello, Raphael,
Michelangelo and Leonardo?
Sound like you're a fan of the<br/>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Gotcha. Skin it.
He will get that on the drive home.
He didn't.
- Fireworks?<br/>- Yeah.
Everything in there is a<br/>prop we'll need for tonight.
Everything.
All right, here's how<br/>this is going down.
You'll be wearing this<br/>earpiece and microphone.
I'll be staked out here,<br/>telling you exactly what to say,
so just stay focused and you'll be fine.
Which play are we gonna run first?
How about the "Weekend at Barney's"?
Oh, Ted, your first day at the salon,
and you want to do a cut and color?
No. Tonight we're gonna<br/>start off with...
Ice Man to Neruda.
Ice Man to Neruda.
Bogey at 10:00,
and she is packing two<br/>fully-operational sweater stretchers.
That's bravo, Oscar,<br/>Oscar, bravo, Sierra.
Possible delta cups.
Copy that. Engaging target.
Over.
Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa.
Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa.
Are you Lisa? Are you Lisa?
Uh, no.
But you must be.
I was told to...
deliver this package<br/>to a girl named Lisa,
and that I'd<br/>recognize her because she'd be...
The most beautiful girl in this bar.
So, here's your delivery, Lisa.
Uh, I am definitely not Lisa,
but I would be happy<br/>to help you find her.
Great, and then maybe later...
I could give you a<br/>different package... my penis.
That is a terrible line!
You said it wrong.
I did not say it wrong.
My penis.
- No.<br/>- My penis.
- Still not right.<br/>- My penis, my penis, my penis!
Hello.
This sucks.
I can't get near Strickland.
At least Marshall's having a good time.
Man, he always knows<br/>just the right thing to say.
For a gay guy, Andy Warhol<br/>sure liked cans.
This sucks.
Maybe I've lost my charm.
No, Marshall,
if Lily's gonna make it<br/>in this fancy art world,
you're gonna have to<br/>make it, too, so suck it up,
stop sitting on the art,
and bust out the "A" material.
You two keep chugging like that,
you're gonna have to Vincent<br/>van go to the bathroom, am I right?
It's pronounced van Gogh.
Oh, "blogh" me.
I still don't get why someone<br/>would leave the hospital
without changing into their<br/>clothes first. Over.
Ted, this is my thing. So just...
okay?
Over.
Okay? Over.
Are you all right?
What? Oh.
Yes, yes, I'm fine.
Tomorrow, I'm...
donating a kidney to my best friend.
My best friend Barney.
Not Marshall.
Barney.
Marshall's so lame.
Anyway...
just wanted to grab<br/>one last drink, in case...
you know, I don't make it.
You are so brave.
Hey, listen.
Before I give my best friend<br/>this organ, how about...
Nope.
Nope, I'm not saying that.
I did hear you,
but I'm not saying that.
Because I'm not.
Are you okay?
One second. I know you put<br/>a lot of work into this.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I understand that.
Why can't I just talk to her?<br/>Maybe we'll hit it off...
Fine.
Copy that.
How about I give you a different organ?
My penis.
- You said it wrong.<br/>- I did not say it wrong!
Thank you all so much for coming.
If you'll indulge me, I would<br/>like to share a story
about my dearly departed grandmother.
Oh, God.
News flash, Johnny Ascot:
Lots of people have dead grandmas.
No, Marshall.
Don't be bitter.
You're here for Lily.
Just look at her, so professional.
She hasn't sat on a single piece of art.
You're gonna ride this thing<br/>out with dignity for Lily.
Not one more thing<br/>that might embarrass her.
I will simply stand here.
Perfectly invisible.
And so I dedicate this show
to my grandmother's memory.
Now...
please join me in honoring her
with 60 seconds of absolute silence.
Okay, Neruda, this play is
extremely complicated.
Let me guess. Does it involve me
saying "my penis" in a Scottish accent?
Now you're gettin' it, laddie!
Hey!
Robin. What are you doing here?
I was curious as to whether you<br/>found Ted a date to our wedding
who was a little less,<br/>you know, Antichrist-y.
Is that the Playbook?
No, Robin, that is a couch.
Oh, you mean the Playbook on the couch?
- I can explain.<br/>- Don't bother.
I can ex... Uh, Ted? Uh...
I got to step away from<br/>mission control for a sec.
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.
Robin...
Robin, wait.
Um... shoot. I haven't figured out
what I'm gonna say yet. Keep going.
Robin, wait.
Look, I'm sorry that I<br/>still have the Playbook.
It's just, it's filled<br/>with a lifetime of great ideas.
Am I supposed to just<br/>leave all that behind?
- Yes.<br/>- But...
"Weekend at Barney's"!
Okay, what is that?
Explain the "Weekend at Barney's" to me.
What's to explain?
I play a dead guy,
and Ted and Marshall carry me around.
Okay. And based on that,<br/>girls want to sleep with you.
- Big time.<br/>- But you're dead.
Yeah. Except not really, obviously.
- But the girl thinks you're dead.<br/>- No, she thinks I'm alive.
- Which you are.<br/>- Exactly.
- Except you're dead.<br/>- Exactly.
- Except you're alive.<br/>- Exactly.
Okay, so instead of...<br/>of being an alive person
pretending to be a dead person
pretending to be an alive person,
why not just be an alive person?
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
The movie is called Weekend at Bernie's.
My name is Barney.
I'm so sorry, sweetie.
I don't know if you heard,<br/>but I dropped some Skittles.
Do you know what, I'm just gonna<br/>go home before I make things worse.
You're not going anywhere.
We're a team.
You stuck by me after my nip slip
at your law school graduation.
And after my nip slip<br/>at the GNB Christmas party.
And after my nip slip
at the Honeywell and<br/>Coots Family Fun Day.
I don't know why you<br/>keep wearing that top.
All right, I'll stay put,
but I'm keeping my mouth shut.
No more jokes, no more candy,
no more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Hey, are you guys<br/>talking Ninja Turtles?
I'm a huge TMNT fan.
I grew up on those comic books.
Me, too! I was obsessed.
Did you know that the<br/>original comic debuted
in 1984 at a convention<br/>in New Hampshire?
Uh, yes.
Did you know that Eastman and<br/>Laird always had their doubts
about their characters<br/>being commercialized?
Yes!
Did you know that the painting<br/>on the back wall
is inspired by Master Splinter?
Oh, the one of the rat doing karate.
I see it now.
Hey, I'm Strickland.
Hey. Marshall.
And this is my wife, Lily,<br/>who, as a matter of fact,
happens to represent one of the biggest<br/>art collectors in New York City.
I love your work.
It's great to see you<br/>getting some recognition.
Thank you. It's been a long haul.
The first painting I ever sold,
I used the money to get my car fixed.
You might say...
I used it to make my van go.
That's...
Um, a little something<br/>called rigor mortis?
Oh, come on.
Are you really this mad about a book?
You really think that this<br/>is just about a book, Barney?
You lied to me.
If we're gonna be in a marriage
and trust each other,<br/>you can't lie to me ever.
Really?
Well, that's just great.
Because, in case you haven't<br/>noticed these last eight years,
lying is what I do best.
I'm a magician, Robin.
Misdirection and deceit<br/>are my stock in trade.
You don't want me to lie to you?
Lies are the reason that we're together.
Everything single thing I did
to get you to say yes<br/>to me on that rooftop...
Patrice, the false<br/>engagement, everything...
it was all utter malarkey.
But...
underneath all of those lies
is one true thing.
One true thing that can<br/>support the weight
of all the lies in the world, and...
and that's the fact that I love you.
And you know that when I say that...
I am not lying.
Wha...
Did you just unhook my bra again?
Jeanette,
this is great.
We're back together.
You're coming to Barney<br/>and Robin's wedding.
I found two wine glasses<br/>you didn't smash.
Call me crazy, but I've got a feeling,
from here on out, it's gonna<br/>be nothing but blue skies and...
What...
the hell...
is this?
Check out this text from Ted.
Oh, my...
What the hell happened here?
Jeanette and I had a little spat.
Would anyone like some wine?
It's a nice C?tes du Rh?ne.
Still needs to breathe a bit.
You know what? I got<br/>a decanter upstairs, so...
We should just drink it now.
And for
the grand finale,
I found your fireworks.
Let's see what they do<br/>to your precious Playbook!
No!
Jeanette, please,<br/>that's Barney's life's work!
It's fine, Ted.
Blow it up, Jeanette.
# Put a candle in the window
# 'Cause I feel I've got to move #
# Though I'm going, going
# I'll be coming home soon
# Long as I can see the light... #
Okay.
No more dating.
I'm ready to settle down.
And, kids...
for the first time in my life,
I really meant it.
Oh!
- Oh...<br/>- The boots...

[<div class="full-script">In the spring of 2013,
Barney and Robin were just<br/>weeks away from tying the knot.
But there were still some pretty<br/>big issues they hadn't agreed on.
Adoption.
I don't know.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
I can't... I can't<br/>believe you're not open to it.
Okay. Let's try it.
Nope, it doesn't work with 27 down.
Hey, with the wedding so<br/>close, maybe we should talk about
where we're going to live.
Fine, enough. Stop begging.
We'll live here. But you owe me.
Yeah, I don't know...
there's just a lot of things I<br/>don't totally love about your apartment.
Like what?
Well, for example, why is
your bed on what look<br/>like train tracks?
You were wonderful.
Well, you don't get to be a<br/>state-certified orgasmologist
without learning how to please a woman.
You don't mind if I spend<br/>the night, do you?
Um, how else are we gonna get to know<br/>each other on a deeper level?
Excuse me, I just have to log<br/>tonight's orgasms with the licensing board.
The Ho-be-gone<br/>Sleep System
by Stinson, patent pending.
What-what is on the other<br/>side of the wall?
Where do the hos go?
What am I, a contractor?
We-we need to go into this marriage
with a fresh start.
What do you say we find<br/>a new place together?
I love you.
And if that will make you happy,
then let's do it.
Wow, so we need to find an<br/>apartment where I haven't banged someone?
How do you feel about Cleveland?
Nope. Ted's mom.
Nice job filling in for<br/>Lily on Marvin's lullaby.
Thanks, but I came<br/>in early on the horsie.
Stupid!
No, you really<br/>nailed all of Lily's parts.
It's been three weeks since I have.
I barely see her<br/>anymore 'cause of this new job.
Well, you know what might cheer you up?
Hmm?
There's a new<br/>Woodworthy Manor on tonight.
Woodworthy Manor
was a show about an<br/>upper class English estate
at the beginning of the 20th century.
My word! You can't possibly mean...
But I do!
With the succession of Lady<br/>Eastbrooke to Viscountess of Marlyemead,
our cousin Baldrick becomes...
the Earl of Witherstead.<br/>- The Earl of Witherstead!
I only posted that<br/>prediction 15 times on the forums!
No, I can't.
I promised Lily that I<br/>would wait and watch it with her.
Problem is, the Captain.
Lily had just started a<br/>job as the art consultant
for an eccentric<br/>billionaire, the Captain.
Oh.
Ahoy.
There's a hot new artist in Red Hook.
He's molded
world currency into a<br/>sculpture of a soulless plutocrat
defecating on the poor.
A scathing indictment of capitalism.
I'll go as high as $200K
as long as you think I can<br/>flip it for double in six months.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Sorry.
Ahoy.
Here's this gorgeously<br/>delicate impressionist still life,
reminiscent of Monet's water lilies.
Where is it?
Rikers Island.
The artist is serving two<br/>consecutive life sentences
for aggravated homicide.
I'm willing to go as high<br/>as six cartons of cigarettes
and a jug of toilet wine.
Is it a strain, feeling<br/>like a single dad at times?
Sure, but Lily's been<br/>busting her butt at this new job.
It's not like she's<br/>been out there partying.
Man, I'm 'faced.
I ate a ton of caviar,
but it soaked up none of the champagne.
- Mondays, right?<br/>- Yeah.
When did you get glasses?
Oh...
you mean my glare reduction lunettes.
Yeah. They help me discern genius
from pretentious crap.
Too bad you weren't wearing those<br/>glasses when you bought those glasses.
Well, listen, baby, I'm just
happy to see you.
And if you're not too tired,
maybe we could watch Woodworthy<br/>Manor tonight.
I'd love to.
Great! Because I've come<br/>up with a fun little game.
I made figgy pudding
and I put it in shot glasses.
And every time they say,
"The dowager will be less than pleased,"
you have to...
Oh.
Ugh...
Ahoy.
A seven-foot-tall cross-dressing<br/>Cambodian
is throwing glitter and fish<br/>guts at a billboard on the B.Q.E.
So he's some sort<br/>of conceptual painter?
No, no, just a crazy<br/>person on the local news.
I thought you might have a<br/>laugh. You're off the clock, relax.
I must own it.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Hey, did you find a<br/>Realtor to sell this place yet?
Robin, a Realtor's just gonna<br/>give it to the highest bidder.
I need this place to<br/>go to someone worthy.
And I've made some inquiries.
Barney?
My son.
Barney, enough with<br/>the floating Jor-El head
from the Fortress of<br/>Solitude in Superman, okay?
It's getting old.
I only use it to say really<br/>important stuff.
Last time you used it to tell me
Wendy's had introduced a<br/>spicy version of "The Baconator".
Exactly.
And now, my son...
it is time for me to bestow on you...
Can we just talk<br/>face-to-face like normal people?
Ted, just...
just...
okay?
My son,
it is time for me to bestow on you...
Close the door.
No. This is...
Oh, my God, can you just be cool?
Once? Please?
Just once?
Can you just once be cool?
Once?
Please?
My son...
for many years this apartment<br/>has been my Fortress of Barnitude.
But now the time has<br/>come for me to pass it on.
Soon, this place will become
your "Fortress of Soli-Ted".
Barney, I wouldn't live here even if<br/>you scrubbed every inch of this place
with Purell, amoxicillin and holy water.
Fine.
But I think we can both agree,
it would be totally<br/>awesome to see my deal
floating around all<br/>huge-like on the big Jor-El cam.
Hold on.
Now, it's a little<br/>cold here in the Fortress,
so don't judge the si...
Ted, wait.
What did you...
That's... okay, that's not funny.
Ted, open the...
Uh... walls closing in.
I can't... can't breathe.
Must...
show deal...
on Jor-El cam...
I can't...
Oh, well, guess I'm keeping<br/>this place forever, good night.
Wait a... wait a minute, that's it?
Ted wasn't interested in<br/>buying your apartment,
so you just gave up?
Barney, I gave up my beautiful<br/>two-bedroom apartment
on the Upper West<br/>Side that was rent-free
and the landlord<br/>hand-washed all my delicates.
Which is probably why it was rent-free.
The point is,
I need to buy all new underwear,
and you agreed that we<br/>would find a new place together.
Oh, God, Barney,
relationships are<br/>about trust and compromise.
You can't just... Oh, you are so dead.
If I ever figure a way out of<br/>here, I will make your life a living...
Lily and I really need this night out.
A big fancy dinner and the ballet.
Thank you so much for babysitting.
Hey, three bucks an hour, thank you.
Oh, hey, baby.
Yeah, I'm just on my way<br/>out. If you get there before...
Come on, really?
I'll see you later.
Captain?
I'm sorry, dude. But, hey,
look at it this way:
now you don't have to go to the ballet.
Get your head out of your<br/>ass, Ted. There was no ballet.
We were gonna sneak<br/>into your apartment and bang.
Well, you know what might take<br/>both our minds off that?
A little...
Woodworthy Manor.
No, I can't.
I promised Lily
that I would wait and watch it with her.
And I feel like I'd be cheating on her.
Sure, sure, sure, sure, I get all that.
It's just...
You know, tonight<br/>they're gonna finally reveal
who framed the chimney sweep
for stealing Lord<br/>Stoutshire's gooseberries.
And reveal the winner of the<br/>local gardening competition.
I don't know how they're going to<br/>pack all that action into one episode.
Oops.
No, Ted, you know
- I promised Lily, I...<br/>- Shh, shh, shh.
Just let it happen.
Later that week, Barney<br/>came home to discover
that Robin had a little<br/>surprise waiting for him.
Wha...?
- Mimosas?<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Freshly-baked cookie smell?
A middle-aged woman in a red blazer?
I see what this is.
You finally green-lit my orgy idea!
Okay. It's an open house, Barney.
Say good-bye to your fortress.
If we weren't about to have an orgy,
I'd be so mad at you right now.
If you'll follow me into the bedroom,<br/>I'll show you some beautiful woodwork.
I am way too upset right<br/>now to point out how many women
have seen some<br/>beautiful woodwork in there.
Angry self five!
Rah!
Robin, I did not agree to this.
Yes, you did.
That is why I gave up my apartment.
Not so I could live in a<br/>disease-riddled bang pad
haunted by the<br/>ghosts of your ex-skanks.
The bathrooms are Italian marble.
Hello, old bean. Jolly<br/>good evening, isn't it?
What are you doing here?
And why do you sound like Madonna?
Uh, Robin asked us all<br/>to come here and pretend
that we are prospective<br/>buyers who love this apartment.
And inspired by a character
on Woodworthy<br/>Manor, I've decided to play
Emsbry Postlethwaite,
a handsome cricket player who<br/>secretly hates his life.
You don't have to be a cricket player.
Tell that to Emsbry's father.
Sorry!
Oh...
I was checking out some mole<br/>people's graffiti art
and my cape got caught on the F train.
Oh.
Bisou bisou.
Oh, what a cute baby.
What's his name?
Marvin.
For my father.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Have you two been looking at a<br/>lot of places in this neighborhood?
- Oh, actually they're not...<br/>- Yes, we have.
What?
My husband Emsbry and<br/>I just love this area.
I'm a cricket player<br/>who secretly hates his life.
What are you doing?
Well, you were late yet again,
and so I'm gonna do this little<br/>scene study with Ted.
Why? Because he's there for me.
Pretending you're married?
That's going a little far to<br/>prove your point, isn't it?
Excuse me, but I think it's<br/>offensive to suggest
the only reason gay people<br/>get married is to prove a point.
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't... that's not what I...
Thank you, sister... somebody needs
to get this lady's<br/>mind a rearview mirror
because she is thinking<br/>in reverse. - Mm-hmm.
Hate is a four-letter word.
I didn't... I voted for...
Oh, is this part of a security system?
Sort of.
It's connected to the<br/>welcome mat. You see...
Let's say the young<br/>lady you're bringing home
is dressed for winter.
Under those layers, an<br/>unwelcome surprise could await you.
The scale with body fat calculator
I've hidden under the welcome mat
makes sure you never<br/>have banger's remorse.
The Heavy Set Go
by Stinson, patent pending.
'Cause there's only one kind<br/>of chubby you want in the bedroom.
Am I right, people?
This guy knows what I'm talking about.
I don't want to tell<br/>you and Emsbry how to raise
your child, but I think if<br/>you keep letting him nap,
he's gonna be up all night.
Funny, you sound like someone who's been
around for his bedtime lately.
Uh, can somebody get<br/>this lady a storefront
'cause she needs to mind<br/>her own business, mm-kay?
Would you stop it?
Oh, right, right, because it's a choice.
You know what's not a choice?
Being gay for this kitchen.
That came out wrong... the point is,
let's focus on this awesome apartment.
You're right.
Look at that fabulous plasma television.
My ex-husband, who<br/>never supported my career,
would love to watch the<br/>Vikings never win a Super Bowl
in franchise history on that thing.
- How dare you.<br/>- Don't let her push your buttons.
Right.
I don't care about football.
I'm more of a...
Woodworthy Manor fan.
I very much enjoyed<br/>watching it the other night.
- With Emsbry.<br/>- Oh, you didn't.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I know who deliberately overwatered Lady<br/>Chillsbury's prize-winning roses.
They have been building to<br/>that reveal all season,
Marshall, don't you tell me...
It was Parson Smallsby.
Wow, great view.
And customizable.
Let's say you<br/>promised a girl a surprise trip
to the most romantic place on Earth.
No peeking.
Wow, we must've gone far.
We were on your private<br/>jet for, like, six hours.
Well,
You definitely<br/>weren't on a bus to Delaware
and back wearing<br/>earplugs, I'll tell you that much.
And I think you'll<br/>agree it was worth the wait
once you see the view.
Et voila ma ch?rie.
Oh, my God.
You flew me to Vegas?
It's... it's Par...
Well, hey, whatever works, whatever...
The Room With a Screw
by Stinson, patent pending.
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to drive people away.
No, I'm not... I'm just trying
to show off all of its<br/>one-of-a-kind features.
See, see, there's also... Venice.
Niagara Falls,
African safari.
Oh... and my favorite...
Huh?
Nothing gets a girl<br/>to go from "on the fence"
to "on all fours" faster than thinking
everyone she's ever held<br/>dear is a glowing pile of ash.
Mushroom cloud five.
I love you accent.
Thank you.
I practiced it all morning.
- You are adorable.<br/>- Well...
That Marshall's a lucky man.
Well, aren't you ducky?
Seriously if you were straight,
I'd be all over you.
Huh.
What's this?
Oh, God.
Only the best thing ever.
Let's say you had a<br/>wonderful night with a girl, but now
she's turning into a<br/>bit of a morning-after pill.
See? We need to extend the chute
and add a landing spot.
And you said testing it<br/>with a dummy was a waste of time.
No, I said "dressing the<br/>dummy" was a waste of time.
The Escape From Bitch Mountain
by Stinson, patent pending.<br/>- Okay.
He's kidding, it's just,<br/>you know, in case of fire.
No, but I'm glad you mentioned fire.
See those smoke detectors?
Say these words.
"I'm looking for a deeper commitment".
It's also triggered by "I'm<br/>too tired," "Let's snuggle,"
and "I'm a week late".
Barney, I'm getting wet.
And that turns it off.
Look, just stop talking.
We've made up our minds.
Oh, well, thanks for taking a look.
I'll walk you out.
We'll take it.
If you never get a black<br/>light, you'll be so happy here.
Yes, yes!
Yes, yes.
Trouble in paradise?
We have a child together.
I can't believe you watched<br/>Woodworthy Manor without me.
I can't believe that you're mad at me.
I've been abandoned by my<br/>wife and my gay companion.
If I get blinded in one<br/>eye by a badminton shuttlecock,
you might as well call<br/>me Lord Esterbrooke.
You watched the new one without me?
Betrayal stings, doesn't it, Emsbry?
Hey.
- Hey.<br/>- Listen.
- I...<br/>- No, me first.
I've been thinking
and I realized something.
The Fortress of Solitude is where<br/>Superman went to be alone.
And I never want to be alone again.
Thank you, Barney, that really...
But then I remembered in Superman II,
Superman gave up all his<br/>powers to be with Lois Lane,
and he was honestly<br/>kind of a vag after that.
- Oh, buddy, just quit while...<br/>- Now, Superman III was
a complete train wreck totally.
What's your point?
That...
that I love you.
And...
I'm giving up my apartment for you.
And that the Superman films are uneven.
I really appreciate that, Barney, but...
Congrats. You guys are<br/>getting a fantastic apartment.
I mean, I know some of the<br/>features are a little weird.
A little?
We're gonna rip this<br/>thing down to the studs.
I get it.
But, I mean, some<br/>things might be worth saving.
- I don't see any.<br/>- No.
You don't see any?
Sure some of the stuff in here
is creepy, but it's also brilliant.
I mean, a lot of<br/>geniuses were kind of pervy.
Look at Thomas<br/>Edison... why do you think
that lightbulbs are boob-shaped?
Yeah, we're taking a<br/>wrecking ball to this place
and turning it into<br/>something actually fit for humans.
Excuse me.
Get out!
The Fortress of<br/>Barnitude is no longer for sale.
Also your husband has<br/>been staring at my ass
all afternoon so don't<br/>act all high-and-mighty.
- You turned them down?<br/>- Yeah.
If I ask you to change too<br/>many things about yourself,
you're not gonna be the<br/>man I fell in love with.
Turns out, I accept and<br/>appreciate even the grossest, creepiest,
most sociopathic parts of you.
Sounds like<br/>somebody just wrote her vows.
Mm.
It's the Captain.
Ahoy.
There's a zebra at the Central Park Zoo
who's got quite a keen<br/>hoof at photography.
Ironically, he's<br/>great with color. Now...
Captain, I'll check<br/>it out, just not tonight.
I need to spend some<br/>time with my husband.
You sure?
I know it's been<br/>tough, me working this much,
and I guess I went a little overboard
with the whole artsy thing.
I know.
- The cape.<br/>- What about my cape?
I love it.
And I... I know that you love this job.
I should be more<br/>supportive... I just miss you.
I miss you, too.
Hey, guys.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey.
You guys are all so lucky.
When am I gonna find something real?
Well, Emsbry,
ready to see what it's<br/>like to be with a woman?
I suppose there's a<br/>first time for everything.
- Go ahead.<br/>- My son.
Okay.
Yeah, all right.
Are you guys sure we're gonna like<br/>this Woodworthy Manor show?
Yeah, it sounds kind of boring.
Kind of boring?
Grab a seat guys, but trust me,
you're only gonna need the edge.
Ah-ha, all right, now,
a little backstory.
Lady Stoutshire has developed<br/>a serious case of croquet ankle
and the cook Mrs.<br/>Bootbrush can't find enough chestnuts
for a proper St. Crispin's Day goose.
Let's watch.
- I love you.<br/>- My wrist is broken.
- Worth it.<br/>- Ow.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in April of 2013,
your mother and I were very close
and yet very far apart.
I was living on West 82nd Street.
She was up on West 115th.
She was getting a degree in economics.
I was teaching architecture.
I was always at MacLaren's.
She was always...
not spending all her time in a bar.
She was dating some finance<br/>guy named Louis.
And I...
I was alone.
Ted, get ready to be surrounded<br/>by half-naked, grease-covered bodies.
And by grease, I mean motor grease.
We're going to Robots vs. Wrestlers!
Kids, you remember Robots vs. Wrestlers.
Forget everything you<br/>remember about Robots vs. Wrestlers.
This is Robots vs. Wrestlers: "Legends".
Elderly wrestlers fighting<br/>old-timey robots
in a<br/>wheelchair-accessible wrestling ring.
Why are we still sitting here?
I got a big lecture tomorrow.
Think I'm gonna take it easy tonight.
Ted, trust me, 20 years from now,
you'll be glad you saw Robots<br/>vs. Wrestlers: Legends.
I can't imagine a world<br/>where that's possible.
I'm serious.
20 years from now,
when my 26-year-old third<br/>wife asks me about this...
- You make a lot of those jokes.<br/>- I'm gonna say,
"Yeah, it was awesome, but<br/>you know the funny thing?
- Ted almost didn't go".<br/>- Hmm.
"But thank God he did, because<br/>it was a great night".
And then she and I<br/>will adjourn to the Jacuzzi,
where my fourth wife will<br/>be waiting for us,
already warming herself up on the jets.
Oh, Robin's here... I'll<br/>tell you the rest later.
Please do, that story could go anywhere.
Mwah.
- Hey, hello.<br/>- Hey.
Here we are at the bar once more.
"What will I have to drink?" you ask.
Hmm.
Minnesota Tidal Wave.
"What's that?" you ask.
Only the best cocktail<br/>ever. "Who invented it?" you ask.
Me.
And it's not a girly drink.
Lily, why would you even say that?
Girly drink.
Hey, I am the least girly girl on Earth,
and I love the Minnesota Tidal Wave.
Thank you, Robin.
Matter of fact, I'm going to go order<br/>one right now with my head held high.
Lily.
- Lily. Yes, please, thank you, baby.<br/>- You want me to order it for you?
- Ted, let me tell you the secret to life.<br/>- Hmm.
Every time I make a<br/>decision about what to do
on a given night, I ask myself,
"What would make the best<br/>memory 20 years from now?"
So I let<br/>20-Years-From-Now- Barney call the shots.
And it always works out.
And<br/>20-Years-From-Now-Barney
thinks we should go to<br/>Robots vs. Wrestlers?
I don't know. Let's ask him.
Close your eyes, Ted.
Okay, now open them.
Barney, I swear to God, if I<br/>open my eyes and your bare ass
is an inch away from my face again...
Just open your eyes.
Ted, I'd like you to<br/>meet 20-Years-From-Now-Barney.
20-Years-From-Now-Barney, you remember Ted.
'Sup?
Hey, Ted. What's<br/>this I hear-slash-remember
about you not wanting to<br/>see Robots vs. Wrestlers?
Yeah, it's just that<br/>I don't want to see it.
- You don't...<br/>- I know.
- He doesn't...<br/>- I know.
Ted, trust us, it's gonna be legend...
wait 20 years for it...
dary!
- Legendary!<br/>- Legendary!
Okay... I'm gonna go home.
- No, Ted, look.<br/>- Come on!
If you don't believe<br/>that Robots vs. Wrestlers
is gonna be a life-changing event,
maybe you'll believe<br/>20-Years-From-Now-Ted.
- Whoa.<br/>- 'Sup?
Wow.
Wow, so many things all at once.
But most importantly...
I don't go bald?
Nope.
And neither do I.
Eeh...
Ted, listen to me.
You, listen to you.
Me.
You got to go to<br/>Robots vs. Wrestlers: Legends.
Trust me, you will<br/>regret it if you don't.
So, what, do I go bald or something?
Is that a toupee?
- Ted, scalp check!<br/>- Can't Robin do this?
Come on, you've been doing it for<br/>years. You know the frame of reference.
Scalp check!
Hmm, that's odd.
Little early in the<br/>week for scalp check.
Five tablespoons of sugar,
a whisper of vanilla vodka
and you're done.
Maraschino cherries.
Oh, and a handful of maraschino<br/>cherries on top.
Wait, you're<br/>ordering a Robin Scherbatsky.
Why didn't you just say that?
One second there, barkeep.
Unless I'm mistaken,
the drink this lady just ordered is<br/>called the Minnesota Tidal Wave.
Origin unknown.
Oh, well, you know, Robin's<br/>been ordering them so much lately
that we named it after her.
You named a drink after me?
Right there in the menu.
Congrats.
I can't drink this.
That's better.
I'm still seething, but that's better.
Okay, 20-Years-From-Now-Me,
level with me.
You. Us.
Is Robots vs. Wrestlers worth it?
It was the single greatest<br/>night of my life.
Even greater than your wedding?
Well, I mean, when I get married,
that'll be the greatest<br/>night of my life.
But who knows when that's<br/>going to happen?
Oh, my God, you still haven't...
Man, I hope I meet her soon.
Oh, God, what is wrong with me?
I'm sorry!
I'm just messing with you!
Now, come on, are we going or what?
Fine, let's go.
Yeah!
Not so fast.
Barney, Ted, 20-Years-From-Now-Barney,
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.
Who are you?
I'm<br/>20-Hours-From-Now-Ted.
And you bastards aren't going anywhere.
So, you're the Ted from<br/>20 hours from now?
Shh.
Just... shh.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
This dummy's about to<br/>go to Robots vs. Wrestlers...
and yes, it'll be awesome...
See?
at first.
But then you're gonna<br/>drink way too much,
hence the headache.
Then you're gonna jump into the ring and<br/>sprain your wrist, hence the splint.
And then afterwards, you're gonna<br/>smoke half a pack of cigarettes, hence the...
Well, that's the sound a good time.
And 20 hours from now, when you're me,
you're gonna want to come back<br/>here, right to this very spot, right now,
and smack yourself upside the head.
Yeah, but obviously I wouldn't do<br/>that 'cause I'd only be smacking myself...
Ow!
Don't do this to me,<br/>Ted. Don't do this to us.
Don't listen to<br/>yourself, Present-Day-Ted.
It's a day of pain for<br/>a lifetime of memories.
20-Hours-From-Now-Me,
just tell me one thing:
do I hurl?
Yeah, kid.
You hurl.
A lot?
Remember when Mom
bought the beef from the Price Club?
Okay, how about this:
we go to Robots vs. Wrestlers,
but I don't drink too much?
Interesting.
- I'm good with that.<br/>- No, forget it.
If Ted doesn't get wasted,
there's no way he'll end up making out
with that surprisingly realistic-looking<br/>female robot.
Wait, I kiss a female robot?
Oh, you do a lot more than that.
Now, look, nobody is saying<br/>you need alcohol
to have an exciting and memorable night.
- Absolutely not.<br/>- Absolutely not.
But in this case, yeah, you<br/>kind of have to be wasted.
You drink beers in cans still.
It makes the robot scarier.
They named my drink after her.
The Minnesota Tidal Wave.
It's my usual.
Immaterial!
If it's gonna be named after anybody,
it should be called<br/>The Marshall Eriksen.
Sorry, it's The Robin Scherbatsky.
Read it and weep.
Oh, so you're gonna Zuckerberg me?
That it?
You're Zuckerberging me?
That's fine.
I'll see you in court.
Little court known as the dance floor.
Dance-off. Now.
No, no dancing.
Marshall, we've been through this.
The doctor said your dancer's<br/>hip is worse than ever.
You have to lay off dancing for a while.
You're killing me, Lily!
You're killing me!
I'm an adult.
You have to let me dance my own battles.
Marshall, there's not<br/>gonna be a dance-off
because the name is staying.
Period, end of story.
I just like having my name on something.
Oh, you do?
Oh, that's great, Robin.
Then that's what you will get.
That's...
what you...
will get.
Mmm,<br/>mmm-mmm-mmm.
Oh, hey, Robin.
You here "for a good time"?
Classic.
Did you write my<br/>number in the men's room?
It... Well, I don't know.
I guess you'll never know unless you go<br/>in there, which I highly doubt that...
There she goes.
Okay, boys.
Close your eyes and zip your flies.
Hi. Don't mind me.
I don't think you should have done that.
Lily, I know what I'm doing, all right?
I'm a lawyer.
I've thought about every<br/>possible scenario.
I'm ten steps ahead of...
Where's she going?
Probably into the ladies' room
to write something<br/>on the wall about you.
Nobody writes things on<br/>the walls of the ladies' room.
Have you been in the ladies' room?
Of course not.
Lily, I know that I have the<br/>sexual charisma of a bad boy,
but I certainly don't<br/>have the manners of one.
What'd you write in there?
Why don't you go in and look?
You know I can't do that, Robin.
Lily, can you go look?
Oh, I thought you wanted<br/>to dance your own battles.
Ladies, put your blouses back on!
I'm coming in!
Dear Marshall,
I know this is a<br/>strange way to apologize,
but I'm sorry I let Carl<br/>name your drink after me.
Why didn't I say something?
Gosh, I guess that goes<br/>back to my childhood.
Okay, guys.
Let's go to Robots vs. Wrestlers.
- Huzzah!<br/>- Now you're talking!
- Here we go.<br/>- Nope, sit down.
Everybody sit down.
Okay, who are you?
Hello, Ted, Barney, 20-Hours-From-Now-Ted,
20-Years-From-Now-Ted, 20-Years-From-Now-Barney.
Hey, how's it going?
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm<br/>20-Minutes-From-Now-Barney,
and I have got<br/>something very important to...
What's the stain on your shirt, bro?
Please, please, I really do<br/>have something very important to...
You look stupid.
Here's your spaghetti.
And be careful...
with the meatball.
And that's the only time my father
ever said he was proud of me.
Maybe that's why I stole<br/>credit for your drink.
Maybe that's why I needed<br/>to pour my heart out like this.
Or, maybe I wrote this so<br/>you'd be in here long enough
for a lady to walk in,<br/>causing you to freak out
and hide in the stall.
- So, you got a text message?<br/>- Yeah.
Whoa.
Try to get some in your mouth next time.
Okay, everybody, listen up.
When I walked in here,
I was<br/>20-Minutes- From-Now-Barney.
But that was 19 minutes<br/>and some serious acid reflux...
who orders spaghetti at<br/>an Irish bar?... ago.
Now, I'm<br/>20-Seconds- From-Now-Barney,
and I'm telling you, watch that door.
Why?
That's why.
Um, oh.
In-in, like, 12 seconds.
Your skin looks great.
Thanks.
And thank you for<br/>taking such good care of it.
Shh.
That's why.
Who is that?
She's the coat check girl
from that dance club we<br/>went to seven years ago.
You remember that night.
When Barney grinded with his cousin.
Oh, man, you remember<br/>that 20 years from now?
He won't let anyone forget.
Coat check girl.
I always meant to go back to that<br/>club and get her number, but I didn't.
And now she's here?
She's in this bar seven years later?
I can't believe this.
So, wait, do you guys<br/>think I should go talk to her?
- Are you kidding me?<br/>- Yes, go...
- How many different ways...<br/>- Idiot.
Hello?
Is anybody out there?
Sounds like the coast is clear.
No, no, wait! Please,<br/>it's not my fault!
I was tricked!
Not cool, Marshall.
This is a nice bar.
Girls come here, they just<br/>want to relax with their friends,
maybe have a few Robin Scherbatskys,
and not have to worry out some guy
pulling a Marshall<br/>Eriksen in the bathroom.
No, no, no, I know. I just...
Wait a minute, did you just use my name
as shorthand for a guy being creepy?
Yep.
Well, you know what, Carl?
I think that you are making
a broad and prejudicial assumption.
So next time I meet a<br/>guy who just goes around
rushing to judgment, I'm gonna say,<br/>"Hey, that guy's being a real Carl..."
You don't know my last name.
You've been drinking here for years,
and you don't know my last name.
I will name every<br/>drink in this bar after you
if you can tell me my last name.
Well, that just seems confusing.
How will you know what<br/>people are ordering?
What's my last name, Marshall?
It's Carl...
's Junior.
Okay, wish me luck, everyone.
Break a leg...
What the hell?
Do not talk to her.
What-what... Who are you?
We are<br/>20-Months-From-Now- Coat-Check-Girl.
But there's two of you.
Right, because if you go over<br/>there and you talk to her,
20 months from now, it's<br/>gonna end in one of two ways.
Either you are gonna get sick of me.
I made you muffins
because of your nickname: Muffin.
Or...
I am gonna get sick of<br/>you and your stupid habits.
Stop DVR-ing the news. You're<br/>never gonna catch up.
Oh, stop it,
you're scaring him off.
- By the way, I'm pregnant.<br/>- No, she's not.
Okay, no, I'm not,
but that made you<br/>happy for a second, right?
- Please shut up.<br/>- Okay, wait,
so you're saying it's<br/>doomed completely?
One of us is just<br/>guaranteed to get sick of the other
and call it quits?
You've been dating for a long time, Ted.
Has it ever gone any other way?
Look at this one.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.<br/>- Hey, you look kind of down.
Have a Robin Scherbatsky, on me.
None of this would have<br/>happened if Lily had let me dance.
Baby, wait.
God, you're still clinging to that?
Marshall, it doesn't matter,
'cause you'd lose<br/>anyway, and you know why?
'Cause I'm Sparkles, bitch.
Oh, and you think you can step to me?
You think you can<br/>step up to the streets?
To me?
You think you can step<br/>up over me to the streets?
- I guess we'll never know because you are not allowed...<br/>- Wait, wait.
That's my jam.
Who's playing my jam?
# Like you carry dairy<br/>there # Carry dairy there #
# Heinie heinie heinie ho<br/># Heinie heinie heinie ho #
# Work your derriere<br/># Work your derriere #
Dance-off.
You're on.
# Work that booty
# Work that booty, work that booty #
# Work that booty
# You got that pretty brown round #
# Want both hands all on<br/>them chocolate mounds #
# Give you my Almond Joy...
Oh.
I think I'm gonna head home.
I understand.
What, you're not gonna try and stop me?
And how would I try and stop you?
I don't know, by<br/>telling me life is short,
and if you ever come across a beautiful,
exciting, crazy moment in it,
you got to seize it while you can
before that moment's gone?
Ted, this moment already is gone.
The whole Minnesota Tidal<br/>Wave thing happened five years ago.
It's just a memory.
And the rest of this
never happened.
Right now, Marshall and<br/>Lily are upstairs,
trying to get<br/>Marvin to go back to sleep.
Robin and I are trying<br/>to decide on a caterer.
And you've been sitting here all<br/>night, staring at a single ticket
to Robots vs. Wrestlers
because the rest of<br/>us couldn't come out.
Look around, Ted.
You're all alone.
Kids, it's been almost 20 years
since that cold April night in 2013,
and I can safely tell you,
if I could go back in<br/>time and relive that night,
there's no way in hell I'd<br/>go to Robots vs. Wrestlers.
No, I'd go home.
I'd go to my old apartment,
see all my old furniture, my old stuff.
I'd see my old drafting table,
where I sketched out my first building.
I'd sit on that old couch
and smell the Indian food cooking<br/>three stories below.
I'd go to Lily and Marshall's place,
be back in that old living<br/>room where so many things happened.
I'd see the baby.
I don't know if you<br/>can picture me holding
your six-foot-seven cousin<br/>Marvin over my head,
but back then I could.
I'd go have a drink with<br/>Barney and Robin,
watch them fight about their caterer
or whatever it was they<br/>were fighting about that night.
But none of those things<br/>is the thing I'd do first.
You know the thing I'd do first?
Hi.
I'm Ted Mosby.
And exactly 45 days from now,
you and I are gonna meet,
and we're gonna fall in love,
and we're gonna get married, and...
we're gonna have two kids.
And we're gonna love<br/>them and each other so much.
All that is 45 days away.
But I'm here now,
I guess, because...
I want those extra 45 days...
with you. I want each one of them.
Look, and if I can't have them,
I'll take the 45 seconds before<br/>your boyfriend shows up
and punches me in the face,
because...
I love you.
I'm always gonna love you,
till the end of my days
and beyond.
You'll see.
Can I help you?
Oh, hey, it's... Louis, right?
It's okay.
It's fine...
I'm in love with your girlfriend,<br/>and... we're gonna get married.
- What?<br/>- Yeah.
Okay, guys, I've been<br/>waiting 20 years for this.
Just like we practiced.
No mistakes, ready?
One, two, a<br/>- one, two, three, four.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
# For the longest
# For the longest time
Whoa-oh-oh
# For the longest
# For the longest time
# If you said good-bye to me tonight #
Ooh-ooh-ooh
# There would still
# Be music left to write
Doo-doo-doo
# What else could I do?<br/>I'm so inspired by you #
# That hasn't happened<br/>for the longest time. #
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, by the spring of 2013,
Lily and Marshall had life figured out,
Lily was making a name as the<br/>art consultant for The Captain,
Marshall was a<br/>superstar environmental lawyer
and home life was a well-oiled machine.
And then...
something changed.
Captain, you wanted to see me?
Captain? Hello?
Permission to come aboard?
Granted.
Lily, small order of business:
I'm moving to Rome and<br/>I'd like you to come with me.
Carry on.
What? That-That-That's<br/>amazing,
but I don't know if I<br/>can just uproot my life.
It's only for a year. Carry on.
But I'm married and we have a baby
and they just opened a Shake Shack<br/>on our block and there's never a line!
I understand it's a big<br/>decision. Take all the time you need.
Just let me know by the end of the day.
Also, I need your advice<br/>on purchasing some luggage.
- What kind?<br/>- Carry on.
Well, this has been fun. I should go.
But you literally just got here.
I didn't "literally" just get here.
I hate when people misuse that word.
So do I. But you<br/>literally just got here.
Hey, Ted.
Well, this has been fun. I should go.
Okay, fine, now I'm leaving.
Why do people go to a bar, anyway?
To get your drink on and<br/>some girl's pants off.
I can do both at home.
What are you looking at?
The girl in the big coat?
We were in the same yoga class together.
You know how sometimes you'll meet<br/>a girl and there'll be that
one bewitching little<br/>detail that'll make you
fall in love with her instantly?
You know, a little freckle on the nose,
the-the lilt of her laugh,
the way she pronounces a<br/>certain word or phrase?
Sure, totally.
Well, in this girl's case,
the bewitching little detail is the fact
that she has just a "redonkulous" body.
- Redonkulous?<br/>- Redonkulous!
I've only heard you use<br/>"redonkulous" to describe
Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.
Barney,
this girl has
the Mission Impossible:<br/>Ghost Protocol of bodies.
Whoa.
Just wait till she takes that coat off.
Oh, wait, sorry, you were just<br/>about to leave, right?
I mean, I've already<br/>paid for this drink.
Guys, The Captain just made<br/>me a very interesting offer.
Finally, we get around to<br/>the real reason he hired you.
Just promise you film<br/>it, and please use a tripod.
There's nothing<br/>artistic about shaky-cam.
It just looks sloppy.
He wants me to move to Rome<br/>for a year to buy art for him.
Whoa! Seriously?
- Is that something you want to do?<br/>- Are you kidding?
I've always wanted to live abroad!
My summer in Paris, back in<br/>college, was so enlightening:
the art, the history, the free cheese
just for wearing a low-cut top.
Well, how does Marshall<br/>feel about moving?
I haven't told him yet.
He really loves his job here.
Yeah, but he also loves Italy!
He took a week of Italian in college,
and the only reason he dropped<br/>it was 'cause he had a conflict...
with being not stoned.
But he still knows how<br/>to say the phrase,
"Come on, bro, don't<br/>Bogart all the Funyuns".
All right, I'm gonna call him.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby, I can't talk right now.
I'm working on a big case. Bye.
And that's when Lily realized
what moving to Rome would really mean.
And before you know it...
his life turns into an angsty,
existential<br/>black-and-white Italian movie.
Exactly.
I used to be a lawyer.
I don't know anymore.
I'm sorry. I got to<br/>hit pause for a second.
Why is it so hot in here?
Oh, right. While you<br/>were blabbering on and on
about your whole life<br/>crisis or whatever,
I slipped Carl a hundred to<br/>turn the heat up in here.
What? Why?
Because she is still in<br/>the big puffy coat!
- Barney, what are you doing?<br/>- I'm trying her out of that coat,
that's what I'm doing! I'm fighting<br/>hotness with hotness!
You're engaged.
Okay, Lily, clearly<br/>you're forgetting something.
Yes, I'm engaged to the<br/>coolest girl on Earth.
This is about looking, not touching.
Robin understands there is<br/>one set of balls she can't tie up
with a necktie and lightly<br/>hit with a Ping-Pong paddle.
These balls.
Okay, I'm gonna call The Captain,<br/>get this over with.
Ahoy.
Hello, Captain?
Lily,
I hope you're not calling to<br/>harpoon our big move to Rome.
Thank you, but I can't ask my<br/>husband to abandon his career.
Would you like me to<br/>try and convince him?
I'm very persuasive.
I'm sorry, the ship has sailed.
What's that mean?
Well, you know, "The ship has sailed"?
That it's over and<br/>there's nothing you can do?
What a peculiar expression. Hmm.
Well, thanks for all<br/>your hard work, Lily.
I've never been good<br/>at good-byes, so...
Well, that's that.
My dream job as an art<br/>consultant is over.
- And the sad part...<br/>- Okay, I gotta stop you right there, Lily,
'cause unless I'm<br/>mistaken, lock and load gentlemen.
A scarf? No, don't put on, take off!
Okay, you're starting to drool.
I'm calling creepy.
Lily, it's fine.
This is purely academic.
It's-It's like<br/>bird-watching.
And right now, I am<br/>watching a double-breasted... Robin!
Wait... they know each other?
Whoa, wait... what is going on here?
Oh, my God, it's happening.
This is just like I imagined.
Right in front of Ted, so<br/>I can rub it in his face.
The belt is mine!
Hi, guys. Barney, you remember Liddy.
I do?
Yes! Libby.
Liddy. We met when Robin hired me.
Robin hired you? Naughty girl. Okay.
Okay, so how's this gonna go down?
You two just gonna<br/>start, and I'll just jump in?
Uh, she's our wedding planner.
Of course she's the wedding planner!
Good to see you again, Libby.
- Liddy.<br/>- Yeah.
Hey, I'm Ted. We...<br/>we met once before.
Oh, right, in yoga class. How are you?
She's talking to me.
Well, I would love to stay,<br/>but now that I'm unemployed,
I think I'll go<br/>surprise Marshall at work.
Wedding planner.
So Lily went to visit Marshall at work,
hoping she wasn't<br/>interrupting anything important.
She wasn't.
Whoa. What is going on?
Bernard, if we just<br/>glue the cards together...
Lily! What are you doing here?
Well, I baked you brownies
because I thought you<br/>were busy working, but...
so when you said...
Lily, hey, I can't really talk.
I'm working on a big project right now.
It's a real house of cards.
Is this the "house of<br/>cards" you were talking about?
I thought you had some big client.
Oh, sweetheart, we haven't<br/>had a client here in months.
Mmm! Brownies! Hey!
What is going on? What do you mean
you haven't had a client in months?
Ever since the Gruber<br/>case, we lost a lot of business,
people got laid off... it's<br/>just me and Bernard now.
Where's Cootes?
He's holed up in a<br/>bomb shelter in Colorado,
waiting for the apocalypse<br/>and tending to his herb garden.
So all those times I've<br/>called you in the past few months,
when you talked about<br/>how busy you were...
you were just lying to me?
Technically, I never lied...
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby, I can't talk right now.
I'm working on a big case. Bye.
That is a big case.
Bad time, Lily. I got<br/>to focus on the client.
Gotta go. Bye.
Where were we?
Chapter 19.
I can't talk right now,<br/>I got a lot on my plate.
Well, let's dig in.
If we start now, we<br/>can be done by lunch.
Now's not a good time, Lil.
We got a lot of<br/>balls in the air right now.
Okay, toss me the stapler.
Unbelievable.
Wait...
when you said you<br/>were about to get reamed...
Oh, right. That.
No, sometimes, for fun,
We throw reams of paper at each other.
Bernard! Not a good time!
Read the room!
I'm sorry, baby, I...
I didn't want you to see me fail.
Damn it! Do you realize what<br/>you cost us by lying to me?
The Captain is moving to Rome,
and he offered to bring me<br/>along as his art consultant,
but I turned it down,<br/>because I thought you loved your job.
Oh, my gosh.
If we lived in Italy,
I could just spend my<br/>days taking care of Marvin
and trying to make pasta and watching<br/>Italian Price Is Right.
- It sounds like a dream!<br/>- Oh, it's too late.
No, no. Lily, I'm going<br/>to The Captain's right now!
I'm gonna make this right!<br/>I'm gonna get you that job!
- No, Marshall...<br/>- You're getting that job!
You can just make it out to Liddy Gates.
That's L-D-D-Y.
L-I, two D's...
double D...
two D's... Y.
Well, here is the<br/>final menu, as we discussed,
but let me be clear. You're<br/>the boss, I'm here to serve you.
So if there's<br/>anything you want me to remove,
just tell me to remove it and it's gone.
I'll remove anything you want.
That sounds like a sound policy.<br/>Up to you, whatever you feel like.
That's a good... That's<br/>a good thing to know.
That's fine, you can remove<br/>whatever you want.
I'm serious, and I won't<br/>be offended, you want it gone,
I'll take it right<br/>off. Is it hot in here?
- You know what?<br/>- It's not cold.
- It's hot, it's sticky.<br/>- It's not... It's like
Bikram, right?
We're yoga buddies.
# Yoga buddies.
Well, I'll let you guys read the menu.
- Can you point me to the...<br/>- Coat rack?
restroom?
Uh, it's right over there.
But it's hard to pee in a giant coat.
Okay, what's going on?
Why are you guys being so weird?
Ted says that Liddy<br/>has a ridonkulous body,
but there's no way of verifying because<br/>she won't take off the coat!
Is that why it's so hot in here?
Did you pay Carl to<br/>turn up the heat again?
Well, yes.
But I was curious.
I want to get that coat on the rack
so I can see the rack<br/>that's under the coat.
My God.
I have been wondering the same thing.
I mean, she never takes that coat off.
Whatever she's smuggling<br/>under there has to be thermonuclear.
I bet she has WBDs.
Weapons of bra destruction.
Thank you.
This, this is why
you're the coolest fianc?e ever.
So, Ted, when you say ridonkulous...
I can't even describe it.
It'd be like trying to<br/>explain a rainbow to a blind person.
Is she single?
Why don't you ask her out?
Actually, I almost<br/>did the first time we met,
before she took off that coat.
Sandstorm?
Dubai? That hoodie?
I mean, it's ridonkulous.
Oh, I know. I so want to see it again.
Well, hey, I mean, maybe after<br/>this, if you're not doing anything.
Totally, and maybe later,<br/>we could get a bite to eat.
There's this great<br/>place that's super close.
No, I...
No, I... No.
It was just too much.
Indiana Jones<br/>wouldn't look at this body.
This is a body that<br/>would melt a Nazi's face.
Oh, man, I want my face to melt.
It's too bad Marshall isn't here.
Why Marshall?
'Cause he could just say...
Hey, Liddy,
why don't you take off that coat?
- And Liddy would be all...<br/>- Sure, should I take my shirt off, too?
No, the coat's probably enough.
And he'd get away with it.
You know why? No stink.
You obviously haven't split a<br/>cab with him after basketball.
No, I don't mean "physical stink".
I mean the pheromonal stink
a guy gives off when he's<br/>desperate for action
to a pathetic degree.
You know, like Ted.
- I have stink?<br/>- Bro, you dipped in stink.
If Liddy came back to<br/>the table and you said...
Uh, Liddy,
why don't you... take off that coat?
You want me to take my coat off? How<br/>about instead, I take off your face?
Ow!
Ow, oh!
Really?
You had to have her beat me up?
She's not done, Ted.
Ghost Protocol
wasn't that good!
Marshall, on the other hand,
girls take one look and just know
there's a guy who's<br/>met the girl of his dreams
and wants to spend the rest of<br/>his life with her and only her.
So why don't you ask her?
Pardon me?
Aren't you a guy who's met
the girl of his<br/>dreams and wants to spend
the rest of his life<br/>with her and only her?
Of course, baby.
So why don't you ask<br/>her to take her coat off?
Um...
And you never even saw Ghost Protocol.
So, the big day's coming up.
How are you guys feeling?
I talked to the caterer, and the<br/>mini lamb shanks are gonna be amazing.
Oh, by the way, I talked to<br/>the florist, and the violets
- are gonna be gorgeous.<br/>- Okay, Barney. You can do this.
Just say it. Say it.
- Say it.<br/>- little ones and big ones...
Hey, Liddy, do you<br/>want to take off your coat?
Sure.
I did it! I proved to<br/>myself and everyone else
that I have no desire to<br/>be with any other woman.
I am completely immune to every other...
Holy crap!
And it was, indeed,
ridonkulous.
And we got to see it, all thanks
to this lovely lady right here.
Robin, thanks to you, I<br/>can now walk up to any girl
and say whatever<br/>creepy, disgusting thing I want
and totally get away with it.
- Mm.<br/>- Man!
I think I'm gonna like being married.
Hello?
Ahoy.
Ahoy, Lily.
I just had a long<br/>talk with your husband.
He convinced me to offer<br/>you that job in Rome again.
How do you respond?
Thanks, but the answer is still no.
Lily, why the hell did<br/>you turn that down again.
Because I'd have to<br/>get a new passport photo.
And I'd miss out on New York in August.
Unless they open the<br/>Shake Shop in a box.
Lily, what's the real reason?
What if we moved to Rome...
- What's so funny?<br/>- I'm uh sorry.
I can't believe you paid a 10<br/>million euro this painting.
Why not?
This is not even a painting.
I spin my plate, it's<br/>gonna fill a blank canvas.
Smell it.
It's like a toilet.
It just make you look uh
stupida.
- Lily, you're fired.<br/>- What?
But no. I... it's<br/>still a great painting.
I like what it says<br/>about the structure in society
and the changing worlds of women.
I used to be an art consultant.
Hey baby. It's time<br/>for Marvin's... bottle.
And it's all because I<br/>screwed up and through away
a perfectly<br/>comfortable life here in New York.
Lily, you're not going to screw up.
You know what, just<br/>please, just leave it alone.
Besides,
deep down, I don't think
Marshall's even excited about Italy.
At that very moment in little Italy.
Marron!
I can't wait for my wedding day.
I mean, there is no way
that Liddy is gonna be<br/>wearing that coat, right?
Right?
"Barney Stinson, do you hope
she wears something<br/>slinky and backless?"
"I do".
Okay, can I just say<br/>something as your best man?
Be careful.
What do you mean?
You just... you<br/>haven't been acting like a guy
who's about to get married, and<br/>I know you think it's okay
because Robin's so<br/>cool, but I'm telling you,
she's not as cool as you think she is.
Oh,
I see.
And you'd know this
because you know Robin better than I do.
You know what she<br/>appreciates better than her own fianc?.
I'm just saying,
if I was getting<br/>married in three weeks...
But you're not getting<br/>married in three weeks, Ted.
I am.
Robin's marrying me, not you.
You're right.
Not my place.
Why don't I get the next round?
So...
how many times are you<br/>gonna say no to your dream job?
I'm just trying to plan my day.
I'm a scaredy-cat, okay?
I want to be the type of<br/>person that just charges fearlessly
into the unknown, but
I came back two weeks early from Paris
because I was lonely.
I went to San Francisco,
and I was never more<br/>depressed in my life.
I'm small town, Marshall.
I'm a hick from Brooklyn<br/>who's terrified of living
more than ten subway<br/>stops from where I was born.
Okay, Lily, if I can move<br/>from St. Cloud, Minnesota,
to New York City,
then you can move to Rome.
We know nothing about Italy.
We have no friends there. We<br/>don't speak the language.
Okay, so you know that one sentence.
Can you say anything else?
That-that was the same sentence.
You just changed the inflection.
I love you, too.
All right.
We're going to Italy.
Si!
You may not know this yet, but...
I've already done some shopping.
Welcome home.
Oh...
You are so cool,
but not for long.
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Kids, this is the story of the night
Barney's life completely fell apart.
My life is finally perfect,
and that is never going to change.
Fired up for dinner<br/>with my mom tonight?
Yeah. To help<br/>streamline the rest of our lives,
you can always assume my answer<br/>to that question is no.
- W...<br/>- I'm pretty nervous.
Nervous? Why? It's<br/>just gonna be two hours
of "I love Barney the most".<br/>"No, I love Barney the most".
You're right. I may not<br/>even get a chance to talk.
But I'm still... I don't<br/>know. I'm worried she won't think
I'm good enough to be engaged<br/>to her precious little Love-Love.
Okay, first of all,
it's "Wuv-Wuv".
And second, don't worry.
I'm just gonna drop<br/>off our catering deposit,
and then I will be there for you.<br/>- Mm.
Okay, well, please don't be<br/>late. I am counting on you tonight.
And be careful... that's<br/>5,000 bucks in there.
Uh, I think I'll be<br/>okay walking four blocks here
on the Upper East Side.
Please, I swear I never<br/>talked to the North Koreans!
Unless you are the North Koreans, in<br/>which case I never talked to the South Koreans!
Barney Stinson,
you are being kidnapped.
For your surprise bachelor party!
A kidnapping.
Respect.
I was secretly worried you might not<br/>be able to pull off my bachelor party.
Yeah, it wasn't that secret.
You two? Planning my bachelor party?
Look, you seem like nice kids.
But this is a sacred event,
a man's rite of passage with his bros.
His...
bro mitzvah!
You didn't just think of that.<br/>You've been saying it for months every...
But here's my dilemma:
my average night is like an<br/>average guy's bachelor party.
So, no offense, but if you two plan it,
it's gonna be ordi... why<br/>wait for it?... nary.
Ordinary.
I can help.
You?
Look, you seem like a nice kid,
but bros' fianc?es<br/>cannot plan bachelor parties.
Sorry. You two are on your own.
And you will disappoint me.
But make it great, okay?
But this is a strong start.
The students have become...
the intermediate students.
I just have to make one call.
Hello.
Robin, great news!
I've been kidnapped for<br/>a surprise bachelor party
so I won't be there at all!
What? Barney, I can't do<br/>dinner with your mom alone.
Okay, I'll call her, make<br/>up an excuse and cancel.
And don't worry, I'll<br/>take all the blame.
Hold on.
Hi, Wuv-Wuv.
Hi, Momsies.
I forgot, I'm mentoring an underprivileged<br/>child tonight,
and Robin can't stand the<br/>idea of dinner with you by herself,
so we're not gonna be able to...
Don't bother. She's already here.
Hold on.
Robin? Too late. She's already there.
Barney, don't...
Robin can't stand the<br/>idea of dinner with me?
Great! We're all set then.
Don't you leave me alone with her.
- That problem is solved.<br/>- I told you...
So what's the plan?
Well, you know the Taj<br/>Mahal in Atlantic City?
Yeah.
You know the secret penthouse
in the top of the Taj Mahal<br/>in Atlantic City?
Yeah!
Boom! There it is.
Visible from our window.
In the distance.
Behind the refinery.
Okay, you can't quite see it.
Why are we outside Atlantic City?
Well, we thought it was best,
what with your<br/>weakness for games of chance.
Kids, Barney was addicted to<br/>one Chinese gambling game
that was, well, sort of complicated.
But don't worry.
Back when you were engaged to Quinn,
you told us everything<br/>you wanted for tonight.
A bachelor party is a man's...
bro mitzvah!
- Did you just think of that?<br/>- Totally!
We can wear...
bro-mulkes...
spin the bro-del...
and consult the wisdom
of the Bro-rah.
Written in...
He-bro.
Not at all bro-ffensive.
Ooh, ooh! Couple other<br/>ideas... and I'm just spitballing here...
so take 'em or leave 'em.
Booze, duh, cigars,<br/>duh, strippers, duh...
Ooh! Things should get so crazy that<br/>at some point we should fear for our lives.
Oh, we'll fear for our lives, all right.
When we watch Al<br/>Gore's An Inconvenient Truth!
Yeah. We're gonna pound a<br/>beer every time we hear the word
"catastrophic"
Oh!
Could that be...
the next item on your list?
Mind-blowing entertainment,
like a naked fire<br/>show or a naked magic show.
There's a good chance our<br/>engagement doesn't work out, isn't there?
Not now, honey.
Or a naked contortionist!
Or...
a balloon contortionist!
Balloons.
Not the inflatable,<br/>round, squishy pouches
I was hoping to see tonight.
Hold on.
I told you no clown.
Well, you didn't like<br/>the bubble guy either.
Hey, Robin.
Did you tell your mother I'm a virgin?
What? Why would you think that?
- Save yourself room for dessert.<br/>- Mmm.
And I hear you excel at saving yourself.
You are so funny.
What's gotten into you?
Oh, that's right... nothing ever.
You may be nervous as to what goes<br/>where on your wedding night.
It's really simple.
Let me show you.
And let's start with the fundamentals.
Why would you tell her I'm a virgin?
I panicked.
Look, I really want her to like you,
so just go with it, okay? Okay!
Listen, Wuv-Wuv, you<br/>better get your ass back...
Another guest?
Who could this be?
Why, it's Lily!
And she's here to<br/>deliver one of your requests!
Oh, thank you, Marshall.
Oh, not that one.
An appearance by my all-time idol,
the Karate Kid!
The Karate Kid was an<br/>uplifting '80s classic
about a teen, played by Ralph Macchio,
who defeats the local<br/>jerk, played by William Zabka.
At least, that's how most people saw it.
Here he is,
just as hot as when his Tiger<br/>Beat photo spread gave a young girl
the courage to explore the suddenly<br/>unfamiliar topography
of her changing body...
the Karate Kid!
Hey, Barney. It's Ralph.
- Listen, it's always flattering...<br/>- No!
I hate Ralph Macchio!
I hate him, hate him, hate him!
He is not the Karate Kid!
The Karate Kid was William Zabka,
star pupil of the Cobra Kai Dojo,
who this monster defeated with a cheap,
illegal head-kick
in the most tragically<br/>haunting film ending of all time.
Oh, see, I thought you meant fun-crazy.
Shut it, Ralph Macchio.
Why don't you go have a<br/>party with Luke Skywalker
and Harry Potter and War Horse<br/>and all the other movie bad guys
and stop ruining mine!
This night has been catastrophic.
"Catastrophic"! Everybody pound.
Sorry, bro.
I'm staying.
If this is anything like my bachelor<br/>party... strippers, booze,
definitely no hand<br/>stuff... wink-wink...
it is gonna be in... wait for it...
credible.
- Incredible!<br/>- Wow.
- You guys are actually a lot alike.<br/>- You take that back, sir!
I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
I mean, did you guys<br/>even get a stripper?
Bro.
Bro.
Of course we got a stripper.
Do we look like the kind of dweebs
who wouldn't get a stripper?
And as the saying goes,
what happens in the sensibly-priced<br/>business hotel outside Atlantic City
stays in the sensibly-priced<br/>business hotel outside Atlantic City.
Who is it?
Police. We got a noise complaint from...
Oh, who am I kidding? I<br/>can tell it's dead in there.
I'm the stripper!
Barney?
Quinn?
This is your bachelor party?<br/>You're engaged again,
less than a year after we broke up?
- Is it Robin?<br/>- Now, hold on.
You're not the only<br/>one with questions here.
You didn't vet the stripper?
Well, I'm glad you're so happy.
After we broke up, I had<br/>to move out of the city,
my car got totaled, and I had to<br/>go back to stripping just to pay rent.
It's like everywhere I<br/>look, my life is a dead-end.
Wow.
I am...
I'm so sorry, Quinn.
So, how does this work?
- Do you give me a private show, or does everyone...?<br/>- I am not stripping for you.
Whoa, whoa! I was promised boobs.
- Oh, Ralph, if you want, I can...<br/>- Lily.
Is that the Karate Kid?
- Yes! - Yes!<br/>- Yes! - No!
- He's a lot like Barney, huh?<br/>- You take that back, madam.
I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
Okay, okay. I'll tell you what.
I am going to strip for everyone here
except Barney.
And I'm gonna make it dirty.
Yeah... I'm the bachelor.
Kind of no stripping without<br/>the lap of honor.
Back me up, bros.
How'd you even do that?
- What the...?<br/>- Oh, my God, yeah!
Hey, Robin.
Hey, sweetie, having<br/>fun at your bachelor party?
- No.<br/>- Good, 'cause my night's been hell!
And that's the inverted chimney sweep,
the last of the 17<br/>basic sexual positions.
- Now, bondage...<br/>- Stop! I'm not a virgin!
My napkin ring has<br/>seen plenty of breadsticks.
And one baguette.
I dated a center for the Knicks.
Oh, thank God you're not a prude.
Now we can really talk.
Four cosmos, pronto!
Now she's drunk,
holding up a napkin<br/>ring and three breadsticks,
and talking about her night<br/>with Crosby, Stills and Nash.
Waiter, can I have another breadstick?
And Young.
Please come back.
Okay. I'll be there soon.
- Real nice.<br/>- So beautiful.
I think we really did it. I<br/>think we did it, you know?
You didn't miss a thing.
- Oh, Quinn?<br/>- Yeah?
You got a little... something.
Oh! Oh.
Let's head back, guys.
This night has been completely<br/>half-assed.
- You obviously missed<br/>the strip show. - Hey-oh!
Ted, this was my bachelor party.
A man only gets two or<br/>three of these in his lifetime.
And this is all you do for me?
That's it, I'm calling it.
Who needs a ride back to the city?
Oh. Oh, guys, wait, hold on, hold on.
Drinking.
A shot.
Shooting.
A gun.
Shot, gun.
Shotgun?
Man, it's crowded in here.
I know, it's like a clown car.
Well, I can make some room<br/>by grinding on Ralph's lap.
Si-Sitting! I meant, I meant sitting.
This is the worst bachelor party ever.
Man, my bachelor party<br/>was incr... wait for it...
and I hope you're hungry, 'cause the<br/>second half of this word is... edible!
Incredible!
Self-shake.
You take that back, clown.
I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
Yeah. You've got more in<br/>common with the clown,
except his suit's more expensive.
Hey, yo!
I mean, what kind of<br/>loser has his bachelor party
ten yards from A.C.<br/>and doesn't even gamble?
- Oh.<br/>- Oh, sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh... oh, wait.
Just a little more. Okay, sorry.
Okay.
bro mitzvah!
Kids, I'll skip over the gambling.
Like I said, it was a complicated game.
Although your old man did<br/>pick it up pretty quickly.
Hey!
You just won 300 bucks!
I just lost $5,000.
Oh, right. 'Cause the chicken.
Yep, that-that's $5,000, yeah.
See, I'm laughing
because you couldn't<br/>see me take my top off,
but I just saw you lose<br/>your shirt. - Hey-yo!
We have to go back.
Loser! Sorry, that was a real sneeze.
Might have made you<br/>miss what I was saying.
- Loser!<br/>- Loser.
We're not going anywhere.
I can still make this night legendary.
Uh...
Oh, oh.
Okay, I got some credit.
I just... mm...
- Marshall, stand over there for good luck?<br/>- Oh, sure.
Okay, okay.
Oh! Oh!
You crazy son of a bitch, you did it!
I just lost $80,000.
Oh, right, right, yeah. 'Cause<br/>the black jelly bean.
- That-That's<br/>$80,000. - He's right.
You know, Ralph,
earlier at the salon, I<br/>waxed on, then waxed off.
Everywhere.
Uh, listen, lady, your<br/>husband is, like...
Hey, where is your husband?
Marshall?
Where's Marshall?
Okay, Lily, don't overreact, but...
Oh, oh.
Okay, I got some credit.
- Marshall, stand over there for good luck?<br/>- Oh, sure.
You sold my husband?
Lily, can you be more<br/>like the Chinese mobster
and give me some credit?
I'm going back for Marshall,<br/>I just need to get some money.
You have nothing to worry<br/>about, these are the "good" mobsters.
Wow, what kind of bozo<br/>does that to a friend?
Shut it, Ralph Macchio!
No, you shut it!
Ralph Macchio's right, you are a bozo.
Um, I think they prefer<br/>"people of bright color".
You know what a bachelor party's about?
Hanging out with your<br/>friends and having a good time.
But you only care about the<br/>good time, not the friends.
So you know what? I'm-I'm<br/>done caring about you then.
I'm out of here.
Ted...
Ted, Ted, I have...
I just tore your mom<br/>away from a living version
of a Nick Nolte mug shot<br/>and put her in a cab home.
Thank you for abandoning me
on what has been one of the<br/>worst nights of my life.
So, it's my usual<br/>fee, plus I always charge
an extra hundred for<br/>girl-on-clown action.
What the hell is she doing here?
Robin, I swear, nothing happened.
That means just hand stuff.
- You...!<br/>- Oh!
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Sorry, Barney, this...
this-this is unforgivable.
It's over.
You know...
I never got to do that.
Ted?
Robin.
We're right on schedule.
- Barney is suicidal.<br/>- I know, it's awesome!
Yep, kids, we had planned out<br/>every step of the night.
It started three weeks earlier.
and you will disappoint me.
But make it great, okay?
Oh, it'll be great, all right!
Okay, after two weeks of brainstorming,<br/>all I have on my list so far is Purell.
Marshall, what do you got?
Well, nothing now.
This is impossible!
How do you make<br/>something memorable for a guy
who makes every night the<br/>best night of his life?
Give him the worst night of his life.
We'll give him the worst hotel room
with the worst entertainment,
the wrong Karate Kid,
and the absolute last<br/>stripper he would want to see.
Hold on.
You want me to<br/>pretend my life's gone to crap
and I'm back to stripping just<br/>screw with my ex-fianc??
I love it!
That party will be so<br/>terrible, he'll have to leave it.
Then I'll instruct his<br/>arch-nemesis to say...
"I mean, what kind of<br/>loser has his bachelor party
ten yards from A.C. and<br/>doesn't even gamble?"
Barney will take the<br/>envelope of cash I gave him
and head straight into our trap.
Hold on.
You want us to rig a casino game
to trick one of our<br/>former high rollers?
Um...
I love it.
Well, then you get Barney to<br/>use one of these guys as collateral.
- He'll probably choose me.<br/>- What?
Well, I'd be worth<br/>more. Yeah. Perfect teeth.
Yeah, it's just...
just I'm way more athletic than you.
Yeah, this coming from the guy<br/>who's never beaten me at skee-ball.
The only reason a mobster<br/>might choose you is because
they'd be afraid I'd go all<br/>"Marshall Unchained" on them,
which obviously isn't a risk with you.
Oh, you want to see some<br/>"Ted Unchained," huh?
I'll show you Ted Unchained!
Marshall, would you mind<br/>standing over there for good luck?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Meanwhile, I'll make sure
he's abandoned me in<br/>my nightmare scenario.
Hold on. You want me to help<br/>you trick my own son?
I love it.
Barney deserves it.
You know, he told me you were a virgin.
Ridiculous!
I know.
You are a dirty ho-bag just like me.
But he loves you so much.
And so do I.
Wait, hold on. Is there any chance
this is all too mean to Barney?
Just kidding.
Okay, we just need the finale.
Oh! The Chinese mobsters chop<br/>off my hand right in front of Barney!
Yes, we're all equally enthused!
Okay, here's the<br/>plan. After I storm off...
Barney!
Barney, hurry! Give them the money!
- Please, hurry!<br/>- Oh, no!
The Chinese mobster is<br/>giving Marshall back
and taking me hostage instead,
because he says I'm obviously<br/>more valuable!
Can you, can you unlock the door?
Barney, please!
- They're gonna chop off my hand!<br/>- No, they're not!
They said you're free, and I think
we agreed that's not something<br/>mobsters would do.
Ted, come on! This is my thing!
Don't hurt him. I've got the money.
Too late!
Not my skee-ball hand!
- No...!<br/>- No...!
No!
Please, just don't shoot me<br/>in the face... or the crotch!
Surprise!
What's going on?
Well, we decided to give you<br/>everything you wanted for your bachelor party
without you even realizing it.
Wait, so that's why you made<br/>me think Marshall might die?
And I'd lost all that<br/>money and my friends hated me
and my wedding was off?
You just decided to-to check off
everything on this list in<br/>the most twisted way imaginable?
That is
awesome!
And it was all planned by a girl.
Wow!
So, Lily...
later on tonight, you want to...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was all just part of the act.
Y<br/>- You knew that, right?
Yeah! Totally.
We pulled it off, right?
Platonic shake!
Everyone, everyone, thank you<br/>for an incredible bro mitzvah.
Mazel brov!
Mazel brov!
Mm, oh, you didn't really<br/>get everything on the list.
N<br/>- No offense to Ralph Macchio,
but he ain't the Karate Kid.
I couldn't agree with you more.
You know,
they almost didn't get me.
But after 18 voice mails...
I returned Robin's call.
And she told me
how you're one of the<br/>few people in the world
who truly gets The Karate Kid movie.
So when she asked if I'd help,
well, my answer just had to be...
Hai!

[<div class="full-script">NARRATOR: In 1994, Robin's dad took her<br/>to New York City
for the first time...
This is amazing!<br/>Thank you, sir!
Well, a little father-son<br/>bonding trip never hurt anyone.
I-I did almost die<br/>from malnutrition
on that wolf hunt last year...
I had to almost kill you
for you to learn how to kill.
(sighs happily)<br/>New York City's the best, eh?
I despise it.<br/>It's like Edmonton,
minus the arts and culture.
Come on, we'll miss our flight.
I'll catch up.
One day, I'm gonna move here,
marry a sophisticated<br/>big-city man
with a sick mullet--
like all the way down to his<br/>shoulder pads,
and at night,
he'll let me brush it...
and I'll dig up this locket
so it can be my "something old"<br/>at our wedding.
ROBIN SENIOR:<br/>R.J.!
Coming, sir!
(whispering):<br/>I'll be back for you.
Back then, I was-I was too embarrassed<br/>to tell you why I've done that,
but we're closer now.
(phone ringing)
I feel like I don't have to hide<br/>my feminine side anymore
just because you've<br/>always wanted a...
Son!<br/>It's Barney!
Great!
I'll be there in 15, B-dawg.
Woof, woof!
(laughs)
That's our thing.
Uh... be where in 15?
Laser tag.
Never been.<br/>B-dawg's gonna teach me.
Look, I-I think that it's great<br/>that you and Barney are...
B-dawg.
...B-dawg are bonding,
but, um... you agreed<br/>to help me with this.
Fine.
Where did you bury this tampon?
It's a locket.
I'm sorry, I get all these
girlie things confused.
Do you need my help or not?
Nah, it's stupid.
(laughs)
NARRATOR: So while Robin searched<br/>for her something old,
Lily and Marshall packed<br/>for their something new:
Lily's year-long art consultant<br/>gig in Italy.
I still can't believe
we have to say goodbye<br/>to this place...
Oh. I know, baby.
But look at it as an excuse<br/>to simplify our lives.
You know, we can't bring<br/>everything to Italy,
so we gotta throw out<br/>some junk.
For example, look...
my old Sasquatch binders
that "I could never throw away"
because<br/>"I was gonna be the guy
who proved the existence<br/>of Bigfoot..."
These are obviously<br/>coming to Italy.
But these handbags?
Gonzo.
No way!
These have sentimental<br/>meaning to me.
Didn't you shop-lift these<br/>in your 20s?
Yes, and I get very nostalgic<br/>for that time.
You get older, you have kids,<br/>you stop stealing, it's sad.
Lily...
we just don't have<br/>room for these.
Oh, but you get to keep<br/>your Bigfoot binders?
Wait, why is this one<br/>just December 1999?
Oh. Y2K was coming.
Lot of people took to the woods.
Saw the truth.
Okay, Marshall, we don't<br/>have time to argue
over what stays and what goes.
Ooh, you know who<br/>we gotta bring in?
Okay, I agree he is<br/>good at this stuff,
but he just gets so cocky.
No, he doesn't.
So I heard you guys have<br/>a bit of a...
packing situation.
I acknowledge now<br/>this was a mistake.
Look, I came here to chew<br/>bubblegum and pack boxes.
And I'm all out of bubble...<br/>(gulps, chokes)
(coughing):<br/>Oh, my God.... Oh, my God.
I swallowed it.
Is that bad?
Okay, thank you.
Well, Dr. Goldsmith says<br/>I should be fine.
I just have to look for it<br/>in my stool.
So as I was saying...
I heard you guys have<br/>a bit of a...
packing situation.

Now, as you know,
I'm a bit of a legend<br/>when it comes to packing.
We know.<br/>We know.
Tales are still told
of the time I traveled<br/>all through Spain...
...for two weeks...
...with everything I needed
efficiently packed into<br/>a hands-free belt satchel.
The locals called me...
Yeah, it's not a "hands-free<br/>belt satchel," Ted.
It's a fanny pack.
It's not a fanny pack.
In Spanish,<br/>El Ganso con la Riñonera
means "Fanny Pack Dork."
No, it doesn't.
It means "Packer of Great Skill<br/>and Merit."
NARRATOR:<br/>I looked it up.
It means"Fanny Pack Dork."
And as a Packer<br/>of Great Skill and Merit,
I will tell you how to pack<br/>with Tetris-like precision.
We get it, you pack<br/>a lot in your fanny.
Obvious yet delightful.
TED:<br/>Okay.
I got a big interview at 3:00
about possibly designing<br/>another building.
Until then,<br/>if you abide by my rulings,
I will tell you<br/>what goes to Italy
and what goes in...<br/>The Triangle.
NARRATOR: Kids, as you know,<br/>"The Bermuda Triangle"
was the name we gave<br/>to the curb
right outside our apartment,
which possessed<br/>the magical ability
to make any item disappear.
Instantly.
The biggest rule for<br/>de-cluttering is,
"Have you used it<br/>in the last year?"
If not... Triangle.
Have you used this jump rope<br/>in the last year?
(scoffs) Are you kidding?
I hop threads<br/>every morning, son!
Do three in a row<br/>and you can keep it.
Well-played, Mosby.
Next!
Have you used it<br/>in the last year?
Gee, I can't remember.
Are you trying to bribe me?
I don't know what<br/>you're talking about.
(coughing):<br/>Take it.
Triangle!
(whimpers)
Next!
(laughing)
Wow, you're a natural...<br/>Dad.
You know, I love Robin.
And her sister's okay, I guess.
But there's something nice<br/>about finally having...
a son.
A s...
(choked up):<br/>I...
Cristalli twins, nine o'clock!
(Barney laughs evilly)
Now make like your mommy's<br/>ovum and split!
(laughs)
Solid biology joke, B-dawg.
BOTH:<br/>Woof, woof!
(laughs)
NARRATOR:<br/>Now, I'll admit,
to the untrained eye,
a few of my packing rulings
may have seemed arbitrary.
Let's Go Italy? Triangle.
Triangle...
let's go Italy.
A gorilla suit and a blonde wig.
Have you used either of these<br/>in the last year?
(grunting)
(silly high-pitched voice):<br/>Please, Queen Kong...
be gentle.
(growling)
Nope, haven't used those.
I don't think those<br/>even belong to us.
Okay, here's an easy one.
A leaky, ten-year-old<br/>beanbag chair
covered in beer, bong water
and fossilized Cool Ranch<br/>Dorito fingerprints.
Italy.
Vieni ancora per Fudge Grande?
Guys, this chair<br/>has been here forever.
You gotta take it with you.
Italy.<br/>MARSHALL: Ted...
Italy doesn't need something<br/>that is wrinkled,
red and leaky,
and smells like booze<br/>and narcotics.
They've already got former Prime<br/>Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
(laughs)
I don't know who that is.
All rulings are final.
Okay, why are things that<br/>we like getting "Triangled"
and crap you like sneaks through?<br/>Like what?
That old 50-pound<br/>karaoke machine.
Come on!
We sang in the New Year in '02
on this thing, remember?
We were Destiny's Child!
And since I was Beyonce ,
I'm pretty sure<br/>I get final say here, so...
Oh, we were not your<br/>backup singers, bitch,
we were a group.
I'm sorry, are you guys<br/>married to Jay-Z,
or am I married to Jay-Z?
Italy.
(feedback squeals)
(laser guns firing)
(grunting)<br/>Wow.
The way you used that kid<br/>having an asthma attack
as a human shield?
That took my breath away.
Yeah.<br/>Okay, next,
I'll be point guy<br/>and you lay down cover.
So I'm...<br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
are you suggesting that<br/>I will not be point guy?
(laughs)
Look,<br/>if Michael Jordan's healthy,
you don't let Scottie Pippen<br/>run the offense.
Oh, you're from Canada, right.
If... how do I put this?
If Wayne Gretzky's healthy,<br/>you don't let...
uh...
François...
What I'm saying is: hockey<br/>is stupid and I'm point guy.
Well, I'm point guy<br/>or I'm off the team.
Gah! You are the most stubborn<br/>human being I have ever met!
You better get used to it...
you're marrying a Scherbatsky.
Your daughter is not<br/>even a fraction
as obstinate, stubborn<br/>and... insane as you are!
Where are you,<br/>you son of a bitch?!
Look away, kids,<br/>she's about to pee.
What...?
I am not some animal.
I peed 20 minutes ago
and I buried it neatly<br/>because I am a lady!
Ted, we haven't used this chair<br/>in the last year.
Ergo, Triangle.
Yeah, I guess I see your point.
I mean, if you haven't used it<br/>in the last year...
Oh! (laughs)
Using it!
Italy!
Triangle!
Italy.
Triangle!<br/>Triangle!
Italy.
Okay, stop!
Every time he lands,
that chair farts out<br/>ten-year-old Dorito dust.
Yeah, it's the chair.
Guys, trust me: you're gonna<br/>want this chair in Italy.
I... it'll feel like home.
All right, buddy.
You win. Italy.
Really?<br/>Yeah.
We asked you to be<br/>the judge here
and we gotta trust your opinion.
She's right.
And with all the traveling
that we'll be doing...
we could probably use<br/>a couple of your...
hands-free belt satchels.
You said they were lame.
I hate to admit it,
but they actually sound useful.
Could you buy us a couple?
Two hands-free belt satchels,<br/>coming right up.
Oh, and don't worry,<br/>I'll get cool colors
so you guys don't look like
whatever the Spanish term really<br/>is for "Fanny Pack Dork."
Men, it's us... versus them.
Our actions here today
will echo through eternity...
Stand up straight, Kaden!
I only have one rule,<br/>you worthless maggots:
We all respect each other.
I only have one rule:
For every three tens you bang,
throw a bone to a five.
They're grateful and<br/>hard-working and let's face it,
sometimes you just want<br/>to lay there.
What's that got to do<br/>with Laser Tag?
Everything!
...and we will prevail,
even if it takes all night!
Tanner.
I have to be home by 4:00.
(ray gun zapping)
Anyone else have<br/>any scheduling issues?
You can take down anyone<br/>on their team...
but I want the big man<br/>for myself.
What's your beef with oldie?
He's...
my father.
Father-in-law.
Shut up, Kai.
Wait a second...
We get it, you pack<br/>a lot in your fanny.
Obvious yet delightful.
Oh, no!
No!
El Ganso!<br/>El Ganso!
Liars!
You sent me on a fool's errand.
Okay, to be fair,
buying a fanny pack is<br/>inherently a fool's errand.
Hands-free belt satchels.
And just for that,<br/>I will not move from this chair
until you agree to keep it!
Ted, unlike that chair,
you, sir, are full of beans.
You have a job interview<br/>in half an hour.
Screw the interview.
I'm staying.
And because the forecast<br/>calls for rain...
This... is a raincoat.
(groans)
(sighs)
Go for Barney.
Hey. Um...
I'm having an issue.
Now, listen, Robin...
is this urgent or can we talk<br/>about it later?
Nah, it's stupid.
Have fun.
(laughing)
So long, losers!
(laughing)
Um...
Look, can you guys<br/>help me down?
I... um...
Ted, if this chair really<br/>means that much to you,
why don't you just<br/>take it for yourself?
No, it's important<br/>that you keep it.
Why?
This is the first thing<br/>we bought
when we moved here<br/>after college.
It was the only piece of<br/>furniture we had for a week.
And now you two are
moving to Italy.
What if our friendship<br/>doesn't pass
the "Have you used it in a year"<br/>test?
If you can throw<br/>out this chair...
who's to say you can't<br/>throw me out, too?
That could never happen.
You're not a chair,<br/>you're our best friend.
You can say that,<br/>but a lot can change in a year.
Buddy, I...
Look, I know I'm being crazy.
I just...
I just need a moment<br/>with this chair.
You know... to say good-bye.
We'll give you two<br/>some space.
NARRATOR: Kids, you can't cling<br/>to the past.
Because no matter how tightly<br/>you hold on...
...it's already gone.
Hello?
Hi.
I'm at the Central Park Carousel<br/>and, um...
I'm having a little bit<br/>of an issue.
Uh, what kind of issue?
Actually, it's a long story...
Um, Robin, listen,<br/>I'm-I'm late for a big meeting.
Is it important?
Nah, it's stupid.
Good luck.
All right, here's<br/>the bottom line, cockroaches.
There's no end in sight
and we've got no provisions.
If it comes down to it,
I need a volunteer to let<br/>the rest of us...
eat him.
Barney's team seems<br/>way more fun.
Nonsense.
Candy for everyone!
(kids whooping)
Okay, Team Animal House...<br/>who wants to try a cigar?
Yeah!<br/>Yay! (laughs)
I'm not saying we're gonna start<br/>with your face or anything,
but is there seriously<br/>no one here
willing to give up<br/>a hand or a foot?
We're outta here!
Ted, why are you here?
You had that meeting;<br/>I told you not to come.
You said, "Nah, it's stupid,"
which is Robin-ese for,<br/>"It's important."
Everyone knows that.
Well... not everyone.
But you shouldn't have<br/>skipped that meeting.
Was it important?
Nah, it's stupid.
And yet, my future husband--
who I sometimes fear<br/>is troublingly similar
to my emotionally<br/>unavailable father--
is off shooting laser guns<br/>with, oh, yeah, you guessed it:
my emotionally<br/>unavailable father.
Oh, come on, that's not fair.
If you told Barney<br/>that you needed him,
he'd be here in a heartbeat.
I didn't have to tell you.
And you're here.
You don't even know why.
Seems like I'm here to dig.
(kids' ray guns zapping)
Looking for "D"s?
Long story short,<br/>I promised my future self
the locket would be my<br/>"something old" at my wedding.
What?
No, I just like that there was
ever a version of you
who imagined having a<br/>"something old" at your wedding.
Robin Scherbatsky--<br/>you're a girl.
Shut up. You're a girl.
That's been established.
The new information here<br/>is that you're a girl.
Wait... is that...?
Oh, my God, I found it.
(sighs, laughs)
Okay...
what's really going on<br/>with this locket?
(sighs)
I'm gonna admit something<br/>that I couldn't admit
until I found this.
I've been having fears<br/>about marrying Barney.
I mean, in many ways,
he's-he's grown up<br/>into a mature, caring adult...
I'm gonna shoot you<br/>with your own gun.
(laughs manically)
...but I still don't know<br/>if he's ready for this.
I still don't know if I am.
But if I could find<br/>this locket--
if it was still here,<br/>waiting for me--
that would mean<br/>that the Universe
wanted me to marry Barney.
And that everything<br/>was gonna be okay.
And when it was gone,<br/>it was like...
every doubt I-I ever had<br/>about Barney,
about myself, got dug up.
But I found it. (laughs)
And everything's gonna be okay.
Any last words?
You know, seeing you<br/>on the field of battle--
ruthless, manipulative,<br/>untrustworthy--
you've got all the qualities<br/>I would've wanted in a son.
Now I say to you
the last words<br/>my father said to me:
"Shoot me already."
Or we could keep playing,<br/>if you want.
Nah, it's stupid.
Okay, Team Animal House,<br/>I got him!
Come on out!
You're point guy, R-dawg.
BOTH:<br/>Woof, woof.
(ray guns zapping)
(phone blips)
(phone blips)
Oh, thank God.
This is a sign<br/>from the Universe.
It's not a sign<br/>from the Universe...
Yes, it is!
The-the locket is just gone
and you're telling me<br/>that doesn't mean anything?
You know this is a bad omen,<br/>Ted-- you're Universe Guy!
And you're Skeptic Girl!
You're-you're not supposed<br/>to believe any of that.
Well, maybe I've grown skeptical<br/>of being skeptical.
(voice breaking):<br/>This is a sign.
Look, it's not a sign.
You're doing the right thing<br/>marrying Barney.
The Universe isn't<br/>sending you some message.
(thunder crashes)
As we know from science,
rain is liquid water<br/>in the form of droplets
which have condensed<br/>from atmospheric vapor
and then precipitated.
It's not a sign.
Ted, this is a sign<br/>and you know it.
I mean, the Universe is<br/>screaming at me right now!
How-how-how can you,<br/>of all people,
tell me to ignore that?
Because maybe it's dumb to look<br/>for "signs from the Universe."
I mean, maybe the Universe<br/>has better things to do.
Dear God, I hope it does.
Do you know how many<br/>"signs" I've gotten
that I should or shouldn't<br/>be with someone?
And where has it gotten me?
Maybe there aren't any signs.
Maybe... maybe a locket's<br/>just a locket,
a chair is just a chair.
Maybe we don't have to
give meaning<br/>to every little thing.
Maybe we don't...
maybe we don't need the Universe
to tell us what we really want.
Maybe we already know that,<br/>deep down.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, in the spring of 2030,
we were all tying up loose ends<br/>before the big wedding.
I was right here<br/>in this very room,
putting the finishing touches<br/>on the house.
Oh, come on!
Barney and Robin<br/>were wrapping up rehearsal
for their first dance.
That was amazing.<br/>We can do better.
Back to one, everyone!
Reload the cannons,<br/>we'll go again right away.
And Lily and Marshall<br/>were packing
for their year in Italy.
Hello.
How's my favorite<br/>daughter-in-law?
Oh, things are
a bit crazy here.
We've got this big move to Rome<br/>coming up,
and I, I just can't shake<br/>the feeling
that I'm forgetting something,<br/>you know.
I know, I know,<br/>I'm being crazy, right?
Right, Judy?
Right,<br/>Judy?
You're moving to Rome?!
Is that my mom?
Don't mention Rome.
♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x24 ♪<br/>Something New<br/>Original Air Date on May 13, 2013
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You didn't tell<br/>your mom about Rome?
It didn't feel right.
This isn't<br/>over-the-phone news.
This is face-to-face news.
I was gonna tell her<br/>when we see her at Christmas.
You were gonna wait and tell her
after we had already been living<br/>there for six months?
That... was a great plan.
Damn it.
Hey, Mom, it's Marshall.
If you're moving to Rome,
I at least need to see<br/>my grandson before you go!
Of course, and that is why<br/>we would love
for you to come visit us<br/>for a week.
No.
The place will be all packed up.
Oh, oh, uh, okay, hey, Mom,<br/>better idea:
how about we all come visit you<br/>for a week?
I can't go to Minnesota<br/>for a week.
I have a job.
Okay, Mom, here's the plan:<br/>um, Lily has to work,
so Marvin and I will come visit<br/>you for a whole week,
and I-I'll see if I can<br/>get a last-minute flight.
You are going to take<br/>my infant son
away from me for a whole week?
Whoo!
So, what do you want<br/>to do tonight--
drink ourselves blind,<br/>set a car on fire?
Ooh, watch a movie<br/>that doesn't start
with a desk lamp jumping<br/>on top of a capital "I"?
I'm all yours, Teddy Westside.
Actually, tonight<br/>it's Teddy Westchester.
Got to head up to the house,<br/>take care of some stuff.
Oh, yeah,<br/>how's the restoration going?
Actually, done.
You finished the house?
Well, I want to see it.
Marshall already canceled<br/>the cable, huh?
And the Wi-Fi.<br/>It's like Little House
on the Freaking Prairie<br/>up there.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the wedding<br/>planning is done,
so tonight is all about relaxing<br/>and celebrating
everything that makes us<br/>awesome,
which is why
I requested our favorite table.
The one by the window.
Where we were sitting the night<br/>we saw those two bums fighting.
Over a sandwich.
We almost called the cops.
And then we realized<br/>they weren't fighting at all.
They were making love.
Over a sandwich.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Ha-ha, yeah.<br/>No way, is that...?
El Piramide.
The first cigar<br/>we ever smoked together.
Aw, Barney.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Could you not?<br/>Thanks.
Uh...
dude, I'm not gonna<br/>light 'em up in here.
I'm just looking<br/>at 'em.
Right, but even<br/>when they're unlit,
the smell-- it's very...
Pungent.
Exactly--<br/>thank you.
It's a very pungent smell.
So, could you not?
Thanks.
Okay.
I'm sorry, can you also<br/>put the bag away?
It-It's just really<br/>unappetizing to look at.
You're unappetizing to look at.
You know what?<br/>Um, I'll put them away, okay?
Enjoy your night.
We'll try.
Did those two just become<br/>our archenemies?
No, Robin, they've<br/>always been
our archenemies.
They've only just<br/>revealed themselves.
Hi, Kristen?
Everyone pronounces it wrong.
The "R" is<br/>after the "I""
Kirsten.
And before the "I""
It's Krirsten.
Your table's ready.
Wow, they're "trerrible""
You know what?
Don't even think<br/>about them, okay?
Tonight is about celebrating us.<br/>You're right, you're right.
- We shouldn't let a couple...<br/>- Nope, nope.
I'm a self-diagnosed<br/>claustrophobic.
I have to sit<br/>next to the window.
No, that's our table,<br/>that's our table,
that's our table, that's our table,<br/>that's our table,
that's our table.
You know what?
Screw celebrating us.<br/>You know what we're gonna do?
Make those smug,<br/>obnoxious sons of bitches pay.
Aw...
So Aunt Lily and I drove up<br/>to Westchester.
Hey, baby,
how's Minnesota?
It is so much fun.
Oh, hold on one sec.
Marshall, I made you this<br/>welcome-home ice cream sundae.
But I can't remember,<br/>do you like crushed nuts?
I love
crushed nuts.
Oh!
Anyway, it's,<br/>it's great to be home.
How's Judy doing?
Oh, she's great.
It's cute, you know,<br/>she keeps joking
about how she's not<br/>gonna let us leave.
I'm really not.
It's not a joke.
Judy's going to talk him<br/>out of going to Rome.
I knew something was going<br/>to screw up our plans,
and this is it.
She is going to convince him<br/>never to leave the country.
I think<br/>you're imagining things.
Oh, yeah? Well, check out<br/>what's already on Facebook.
Inconclusive.
Oh, really?
It's getting<br/>conclusiver.
Hey, Lily.
What?<br/>Come on.
Okay, open 'em.
Your eyes-- sorry,<br/>they should have been closed.
That one's on me.
Let's try again.
Wow.
Ted, you did this<br/>all yourself?
Just like Ryan Gosling<br/>in The Notebook.
I was pretty manly<br/>till I mentioned
Ryan Gosling<br/>in The Notebook, huh?
Even I haven't seen it, Ted.
Just think, this is the house
your kids are going<br/>to grow up in.
They are going to<br/>roast marshmallows
in this fireplace.
They're gonna<br/>experiment
with recreational drugs
on that porch.
They're gonna sit<br/>on a couch right here
and listen to your<br/>boring stories about...
"For sale" sign?
Are you selling this place?
Yeah.
Why?
Because I'm moving to Chicago.
Ow.
So, what are<br/>we gonna do--
put something in their food,
key their car?<br/>Ooh,
do either<br/>of those cigars explode?
Hold on, Wile E. Coyote,<br/>I think I got something.
He's checking<br/>out the hostess.
Now, a guy who's happily in<br/>a relationship sees a girl
like that, he'll check her out<br/>maybe 14, 15 times, tops.
16 times, tops.
So Krirsten's more invested<br/>in the relationship
than her fella is.
That could spell trouble.
Challenge accepted.
Hey, do you think it's bad luck<br/>for a bride
to break up two strangers<br/>a week before her wedding?
I'd say it's very bad luck...<br/>for Krirsten.
Ow, I hate this table so much!
Why would you move
to Chicago?
Because it's the perfect town<br/>for me.
I-It's like a Clevelandy<br/>New York,
and-- don't act like<br/>you haven't noticed--
my hair excels in the wind.
Besides,
you're moving to Rome.
Yeah, for a year,<br/>a-and when we get back,
we need you to be here waiting<br/>for us,
hopefully living in this house<br/>with your future bride.
Wha... what future bride?
The girl.
She's out there
walking around New York City<br/>right now,
probably in a pair<br/>of really cute boots
that she's gonna let me borrow<br/>whenever I want
because we're the same size.
She is out there, Ted.
Is she, really?<br/>Because I've looked.
I have looked high
and low for someone I can love
and adore and cook waffles for.
The closest I've come is<br/>Marshall.
He does love your waffles.
It's the<br/>cinnamon.
I add cinnamon.
She's not in New York.
Maybe she's in Chicago.
Okay, you are being ridiculous.
You are going to find someone<br/>here in New York
that you love<br/>just as much as I love Marshall.
And you,
if you let Judy talk you out<br/>of going to Italy, so help me,
I will never let you stuff<br/>my ravioli again.
I'm gonna take you<br/>off speaker.
Lily, you got to relax.
Okay, my mom is psyched<br/>about Italy.
She keeps making jokes<br/>about how she's gonna
come live with us in Rome<br/>and sleep on the couch
and cook every meal for us
so we never have to go<br/>to a restaurant
the whole year we're there.
It's not a joke.
By not saying no
to me right now,<br/>you are giving me
your full consent<br/>for that to happen.
I got to go.
"I'm probably saying<br/>some political stuff
right now to sound smart."
"I'm probably referring<br/>to some snooty podcast
to sound even smarter."
"I'm probably saying<br/>something in French."
Aah!
My God...
Ow.
Okay,
you want to break them up?
I got a plan.
It's something I know has worked<br/>in the past,
but it-it's, it's risky,
so it's, it's not too late<br/>to call it off.
No way, I'm in.
Good, 'cause it's too late<br/>to call it off.
Observe.
And that is<br/>why the senate
can't push anything through.
And Doug Mand said<br/>the same thing in his podcast.
It's like,<br/>"Après moi le déluge!"
Ooh.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes!
What?
Yes!
I will marry you!
Even though<br/>a ring in a champagne glass
is a total cliché<br/>and this is a cushion cut.
And how long have I been hinting<br/>that I want a princess cut?
But yes!
That's a mistake.<br/>That's not from me.
It's not?
We've only been together<br/>seven years.
Now it becomes clear.<br/>Here we go.
You want commitment the same way<br/>you want my brother to work for you.
I'm sorry I didn't put an<br/>engagement ring in your drink.
The way you chug booze,<br/>I'm surprised you even noticed.
So, when are you leaving?
Day after the wedding.
What?
You can't miss the day<br/>after the wedding.
That's when we sit around<br/>all hungover, drinking mimosas
and talking smack<br/>about who looked fat.
That's my Christmas.
Why are you in such a rush<br/>to get out of there?
Oh.
Of course.
You're not leaving<br/>because you think
the love of your life<br/>isn't in New York.
You're leaving because<br/>you think she is.
And this time next week,
she'll be married<br/>to your best friend.
Baby!
I am in the middle
of something super<br/>dramatic here.
But real quick: If you let Judy<br/>come to Rome with us,
you are going to have<br/>to find someone else
to do your laundry<br/>and massage your feet.
Oh, my gosh, she's going to do<br/>all that, won't she?
Lily, you have to stop<br/>freaking out.
Nothing is going to screw up<br/>the plan.
We're doing this.
I love you.
I love you, baby. Bye.
Hello?
Hi. Marshall Eriksen?
I'm calling from the New York<br/>State Judiciary Committee.
Uh, you applied for a judgeship<br/>a few months ago, remember?
Uh, of... of course.
Well, I have good news.
We have a last-minute opening<br/>on the bench.
What are you saying to me<br/>right now?
I'm saying congratulations.
We want you to be a judge.
So, you want me to be a judge?<br/>Yes.
And I would start a week from Tuesday?<br/>Yes.
Could I maybe start<br/>a year from Tuesday?
No.
Got to be a week from Tuesday?<br/>Yes.
And I'd be a real judge?<br/>Yes.
With a robe?<br/>Yes.
Gavel?<br/>Yes.
Wacky Southern accent?<br/>No.
Now, counselor,
are you absolutely sure?
Yes.
And I have to be<br/>in New York for this?
Yes.<br/>I can't telecommute?
No.
I couldn't be the crazy<br/>speakerphone judge?
No.<br/>Could I be a hologram?
No.<br/>Animatronic robot
like Abe Lincoln<br/>from the Hall of Presidents
that I control from afar<br/>with a joystick?
No.
Do you remember the giant<br/>Jor-El head from Superman?
Yes.<br/>Well, what if I...?
No.<br/>Is there any way
that I could do this
and also spend<br/>the next year of my life
in Italy with my wife?<br/>No.
This is such a big decision.
I-I'm not good at big decisions.
Are you sure you want<br/>to be a judge?
Wow. Now that we've broken up<br/>a seven-year relationship
just 'cause they<br/>stole our table,
I feel kind of...<br/>Awesome?
I was going to say horny,<br/>but yeah, awesome, too.
No way.
Are you kidding me?<br/>What?
Whoa. Is there<br/>going to be a fight?
Okay, here's the play.
You take the girl, and<br/>the guy and I will watch.
Hello. Just the people<br/>we want to see.
We got in a pretty big fight<br/>because of you guys.
We had to call our<br/>therapists after hours.
Not cool.
Anyway, it got us<br/>to where we are now.
We're getting married!
And I'm taking<br/>her last name.
You should think<br/>about doing the same thing.
Well, good night.<br/>Good night.
Good night.<br/>Congratulations.
Yes, definitely.
That was us.
We made that happen.
We're pretty cool.
And, you know,<br/>a week from today,
we are going to be legend...<br/>wait for it...
Married.
Legend-married.<br/>Legend-married.
Robin Scherbatsky,<br/>I love you so damn much.
I love you, too,<br/>Barney Scherbatsky.
That sounds good.
Shh.<br/>Think about it.
They're happy.
And I'm happy for them.
I want them to have an amazing<br/>life together. I just...
I just think it would<br/>be best for everyone
if I wasn't around for it.
Did something happen recently<br/>between you and Robin?
No.
Where's the poop, Ted?
She called me up the other day.
She was trying<br/>to dig up this locket
she had buried behind<br/>the Central Park Carousel,
and I blew off that<br/>big interview to go help her.
And then... it started raining.
I'll, uh...
I'll see you<br/>at the wedding.
Yeah.
Even now,<br/>after all these years,
there's still just<br/>this part of me where,
if there's even<br/>the slightest chance
something I do<br/>could make Robin smile,
I don't even think about it--<br/>I just do it.
I mean, if I could make
that locket magically appear,<br/>I would.
I would open a vein in my arm
if I could bleed<br/>that locket out,
just to make her happy.
That's just<br/>a really sucky way to feel
about your best friend's<br/>fiancée.
So I'm going to come<br/>to the wedding,
you know, I'll have a good time,<br/>but after that, I...
What?
I know where the locket is.
What?
I know where the locket is.
It-it was a few years ago,
right before you were<br/>supposed to marry Stella.
I went down to the bar<br/>one night
to get a drink,<br/>and what should I see?
Lily!
Hey, girl.
I got a question for you.
Why isn't Ted marrying me?
Whoa...
I'm sorry. Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I just... I-I should<br/>be happy for him,
and yet here I am,
moving off to Japan just<br/>to get away from him.
And-and I guess<br/>to see those...
those terra-cotta warriors<br/>and the Great Wall.
Well, that's China.
What? This?
No, it's just a paper plate.
Uh, we should<br/>get out of here.
Come on. Come on.<br/>Oh, totally.
I know just where we should go.
Man, you're fast<br/>when you're drunk.
But at least you're still<br/>making good decisions.
Central Park,<br/>around midnight,
digging a hole<br/>with a spoon.
Solid.
Jackpot.
What is that?
My something old.
This locket was my grandma's.
She kept it hidden in her butt<br/>all through World War II.
What? Where was she?
Winnipeg.
Oh, come on.
Lily, it's a joke.
Yeah, I was<br/>going to wear this
when I married Ted.
I guess that's not<br/>going to happen.
So I am taking it<br/>with me to Japan.
Okay, Lily, help me put<br/>this locket in my butt.
Okay. Uh, you know what?
Why don't we put it<br/>in this pencil box instead?
Oh, and then I will take the<br/>pencil box with me to Japan.
Okay. Hey, Lily?
Help me put this<br/>pencil box in my butt.
Wait!
There's one other thing<br/>I have to do.
Lily, it's very important.
It's something<br/>that needs to happen
right now.<br/>Yeah?
Then she barfed in my face.
It was a lovely night.
Wait. You put the locket<br/>in the race car pencil box?
Yep. And then Robin<br/>took it to Japan.
No, she didn't.
It's sitting on my desk<br/>at home right now.
It's been with me all along.
Ted.<br/>The locket is in the pencil box.
This is awesome.
Ted.
No, I just... I just mean,
this is going to be<br/>the best wedding gift ever.
It's going to blow her mind.
Ted.
Be careful.

Hi. One ticket<br/>to Farhampton, please.

[<div class="full-script">TED:<br/>Kids, Barney and Robin's wedding...
... turned out to be a life-changing weekend<br/>for all of us.<br/>Ripped By mstoll
- Well, not just us.<br/>- One ticket to Farhampton, please.
But I'll get to that.
[HORN HONKS]
- Who are you honking at?<br/>- You. You're going 40 in a 65.
Pick it up, Grandma!
Look, I'm happy to rock it up into the 50s,<br/>but I'm gonna need a hand...
...or two.<br/>- Oh, no, not the driving gloves.
In 99.9 percent of highway accidents,<br/>the driver was not wearing gloves.
Because they're stupid.<br/>They don't help you drive better.
That's why no one wears them.
Then why is it called<br/>the "glove compartment"?
I'm not having this argument again.
Now as you know, a Mosby Road Trip<br/>is not only safe, but informative!
Chiggedy-check it!
Manhattan To Farhampton:<br/>Lil and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
That baby's stuffed with fun facts<br/>about our unsung neighbor to the east...
...Long Island. For instance, just up ahead:<br/>The historic childhood home...
...of Florian van Otterloop...
...the Dutch buckle-smith<br/>who revolutionized the belt industry.
- Fun story about that colorblind genius...<br/>- Please stop!
I was gonna slow down for pictures,<br/>but that enthusiasm can't go unrewarded.
[TURN SIGNAL CLICKING]
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Aw... Look at my little cousins<br/>in their flower-girl dresses.
- Aw, they'll look so cute next to the ring bear.<br/>- Yeah.
Wait, you said ring bearer, right?
- Ring bear.<br/>- Ring bearer.
- Ring bear.<br/>- Are you planning some crazy stunt...
...with a dangerous wild animal<br/>at our wedding because...
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Oh, boy, my brother wants to know<br/>what time he goes on at the reception.
What does that mean?
Every wedding he attends,<br/>James insists on performing.
[SINGING]<br/>Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
So? What do you got against K-Rodge?<br/>Everybody loves "The Gambler."
Wait for it.
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other<br/>Uh-huh
That is nothing. I have invited Scherbatskys<br/>from all over Canada...
...and they are Canuckin' nuts.<br/>Like my cousin Ruth, from the Yukon.
I don't like to encourage<br/>Canadian stereotypes...
...but that woman practically<br/>rides a moose! Ha, ha.
- Does she actually ride a moose?<br/>- Yeah.
And I'm worried she'll<br/>bring it to the wedding.
She and the moose are very close.
Whoa.
Every wedding's got a wild card,<br/>but we've invited a whole set.
Someone is gonna ruin this wedding.
It's just a question of who.
I'm gonna ruin this wedding.<br/>My wife is gonna kill me.
CAPTAIN [OVER PA]:<br/>Flight attendants, prepare for departure.
We were gonna move<br/>to Italy for her dream job...
...so I brought my son here to Minnesota<br/>to see my mom before we left.
And then I got offered<br/>ajob as ajudge in New York City...
...which is my dream.
- But that would destroy her dream.<br/>- You are destroying a lot of dreams now.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
[CHUCKLES]
Wait. If I got this...
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
- Aren't you gonna check that?<br/>- No.
It's just another obnoxious update<br/>from Marshall's mom.
She's been posting these<br/>"cute" baby pics of Marvin...
...but it's all just propaganda.<br/>First, it was "Don't move to Italy."
Followed by an extremely subtle guilt trip.
And then, randomly preachy.
No, not looking.<br/>It's just gonna piss me off.
Why are we exiting again?
Turn your binder to the section labeled<br/>"Mennonite Windmills"...
Get back on the expressway, now.
The expressway's for gloveless amateurs.
I'm done. There's a train station coming up.<br/>Drop me off.
But some train's not gonna stop at the<br/>40-foot tall butter churn in Ronkonkoma!
Yes, but unlike any<br/>of your 18th-century stops...
...at least the train<br/>will have a 21st-century toilet!
- You're a 21st-century toilet!<br/>- Train, now!
Fine!
Okay, so far, I've got 12 wild cards,<br/>not counting the ring bear.
- Ring bearer.<br/>- Oh, oh. Here's another one.
You know how I found out I'm one-quarter<br/>Canadian, but blocked that out...
...because your nation's ridiculous?<br/>- Sure.
Turns out I have a crazy cousin Mitch<br/>on that side of the family.
That's funny, I have a crazy cousin Mitch.<br/>But I guarantee he's crazier than yours.
He built his own house from timber he<br/>chopped down from other people's houses.
That's funny, my cousin Mitch<br/>is a lumberjack.
Except mine has six fingers.
- On one hand or total?<br/>- Total.
- Are truckers always beating him up?<br/>- Yes, because...
[IN UNISON]<br/>He has to hitchhike with his middle finger!
Wait.
Is it possible that we're...
Could we be...
[CHITTERS THEN GULPS]
Ranjit, be a dear<br/>and pull over for a second?
Pulling over!
[BOTH VOMIT]
All right, train. Let's show your critics<br/>you're not just a dumpster on wheels...
...full of drunk idiots!
CONDUCTOR [OVER PA]: We're being held<br/>at this station until further notice.
I gotta sober up.
Eriksen residence, Judy speaking.
- Why did you post that judge photo?<br/>- Because I'm guilty...
...of being one proud mama!
Lily doesn't know that I took the job,<br/>so if she sees it, I'm dead! Just take it down.
Fine, let me just get on the online<br/>so I can Internet.
I love the lingo!
[DIAL-UP MODEM BLEEPING]
Just click on the photo on your wall...
...and then under "Menu,"<br/>click on "Options."
Some kind of advertisement popped on.
Oh, my.
That appears to be pornography.
Just click on "Options."
[WHISPERS]<br/>It's men with other men.
Just click on "Options."
- Excuse me. Are there any other seats left?<br/>- No.
I've been going to Pilates, I can just<br/>hang on to the landing gear.
- Sorry, ma'am.<br/>- I only signed up for Pilates.
I haven't actually started going yet.
I didn't sign up.
LILY:<br/>No, I'm not looking.
I don't need<br/>to see my child used against me.
My sweet, beautiful child...
... who I haven't seen in a week.
Whose head smells like love and unicorn<br/>teardrops and why are trains so Ionely?
- Damn it, I'm looking.<br/>THE MOTHER: Hey, are you okay?
You look stressed.<br/>Plus, you muttered a few words out loud.
I heard "Ionely" and "unicorn."
Which actually gave me a great idea<br/>for a children's book, so thank you.
- Are you okay?<br/>- No.
- But there's nothing you can do...<br/>- Want a cookie?
- Yes. Yes, I do.<br/>- Wow.
You took a cookie from a complete stranger<br/>on a train. I like how trusting you are.
- There could be drugs or poison in there.<br/>- There's not, is there?
No idea, I found them under my seat.
Kidding! Sorry. You looked stressed<br/>so I thought you could use a cookie.
Then I thought you could use ajoke,<br/>should've stopped at the cookie.
You know, I don't care<br/>if these are poisoned.
There's chocolate and peanut butter<br/>and caramel in these sumbitches!
- I call them "Sumbitches!"<br/>- Ha-ha-ha.
TED:<br/>And that's how Lily met your mother.
Are Cousin Mitch and I directly related?
No, Mom, I'm asking is Cousin Mitch<br/>a blood relative?
Not asking about Cousin Pete.<br/>I'm asking about Cousin Robin.
- Mitch! Cousin Mitch!<br/>- Find out from Uncle Frank. Call me back.
Well, then go visit Cousin Cecil<br/>at his sky-diving school and ask him.
Oh, God, he did?
I guess that can happen no matter how<br/>experienced you are. I'm so sorry.
[SIGHS]
My cousin Cecil got fired.
Oh.
- That's a relief.<br/>- He was so distraught...
...he jumped off a bridge. He's dead.
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.
It may be our loss.
Just click on "Options."
All I see is a man holding a bratwurst!
- Oh. No, the pornography's back.<br/>- I said, please turn off all electronic devices.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
This isn't an electronic device,<br/>this is actually a toy.
For my son.
- We call it "Phone-y."<br/>- Hm. I call you phony.
We can't take off till you hang up.
Okay, enough. Give me that phone.
- Just click on "Options."<br/>- I don't see it!
- I said, give me the phone.<br/>- Just click on "Options."
- Stop yelling at me!<br/>- Just click on "Options."
- Give me the phone!<br/>- Click on "Options."
Click on... I have a baby!
Please, I have to get to New York.
Should have thought about that<br/>before you attacked me.
All right, boys, you got this? Good.<br/>Let's get this bird in the air.
You're both banned from this flight.
So I was driving with my friend,<br/>who thinks he's the road-trip master.
He has leather driving gloves.
Who wears those?
Huge dorks. That's who.
TED: Your mother was lying.<br/>She had her own pair.
And he always makes us stop to see<br/>some weird roadside attraction...
...no one except him gives a crap about.
Nerd alert!
Kids, you remember the seven-hour detour<br/>on our trip to Disney World...
... so your mother didn't miss<br/>that goat in South Carolina...
... who could blow smoke rings.
And he won't go one mile an hour<br/>over the speed limit.
That would drive me crazy.
I would give him a humiliating nickname<br/>until he stopped driving like a little girl.
It was Lady Tedwina Slowsby.<br/>And it worked.
Look, if it's true, if we are...
...you know...<br/>It's really not that big a deal.
We know we won't have kids.
Even if we did, King Joffrey's<br/>parents were brother and sister...
...and he was a fair and wise leader!<br/>- No one ever needs to know but us.
- Exactly.<br/>- I know.
BARNEY: We might have to...<br/>ROBIN: Take care of Ranjit.
BARNEY: Hey, you just finished my...<br/>ROBIN: Creepy telepathic murder thought!
Aw... It must be a soul-mate thing!
BARNEY:<br/>Unless it's a weird cousin thing.
So we'll be good either way, right?<br/>Honey?
That's right, sweetie.
Now get over here, you.
Gah. Just try and stop me!
BARNEY: Oh. Ooh. Mm, mm, mm.<br/>ROBIN: Mm. Mm.
Well, I can't wait till tonight.<br/>I have got some naughty things planned.
Well, you've certainly piqued my incest...<br/>Interest! Interest!
[BARNEY SIGHS]
I still can't believe he dragged me<br/>to the childhood home...
...of some stupid buckle-smith<br/>no one's ever even heard of.
- Who cares about Florian van Otterloop?<br/>- I never told you his name.
Sumbitch?
I mean, why'd he have to act that way?
He knows I hate how he gets on road trips.
It almost seems like<br/>he wanted you to storm off.
But we're going to the same place. There's<br/>no reason why he'd want to ditch me.
TED:<br/>Suddenly, Lily remembered a week ago...
...I'd helped Robin look for her<br/>long-Iost locket, but it was gone.
Then Lily told me the locket<br/>actually got stashed in my pencil box...
... but when I opened it,<br/>the locket wasn't there.
Good, because that locket's trouble.
How? It's a friendly, innocent wedding gift.
It's not innocent. Ted, you think if you can<br/>get that locket for Robin...
...you'll win her back.<br/>- Lily, I've let it go.
- I mean...<br/>- What?
There's a one-percent chance<br/>Stella has the locket...
...from when we lived together.<br/>- You didn't call the woman...
...who left you at the altar<br/>so you could find that locket!
Of course not! I e-mailed her.
- Ted!<br/>- But Stella's living in L.A. Now.
If she has it,<br/>it's buried in some storage unit.
She said I'd have to fly out there<br/>and look for it myself.
- Promise me you aren't about to do that.<br/>- I promise.
Sumbitch!
You better hope when Sweaty<br/>gets off that phone...
...he can get me<br/>on the next flight to New York.
Got the password from my mom.<br/>I'm gonna take that photo down.
I don't give a damn about your photo!
My daughter is giving a speech<br/>for the model U.N. At school.
I'm gonna miss it because of you.
[SIGHS]
Her father and I are separated.<br/>She lives with her dad.
And if I don't make it,<br/>she's never gonna trust me again.
- I'm so sorry.<br/>- Wow, that worked on you?
Let's hope Pit Stains is as dumb as you are.
Why was this so hard for my mom?<br/>All you do is you click the photo...
...then you click on...<br/>I don't see "Options."
- Just click on "Options."<br/>- But where is it?
- Just click on "Options."<br/>- Is it up in the toolbar?
- Click "Options."<br/>- It's not there!
Just click on "Options"!
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Hi, Grandma. You can explain<br/>how Cousin Mitch is related to us?
- Explain, Grandma! Explain!<br/>- He married Barney's dad's cousin Renee...
...who he met selling Vachon cakes outside<br/>a curling bonspiel in Chicoutimi.
- English, Grandma!<br/>- On our side of the family...
...he was adopted because his real parents<br/>were eaten alive by their sled dogs?
That's awesome! Thanks, Grandma.
[BOTH SIGH<br/>THEN ROBIN CHUCKLES]
- So...<br/>- You and I share no DNA whatsoever.
Let's change that.
RANJIT: Don't hold back.<br/>This divider is totally soundproof.
Go all the way!
- Wait till the hotel?<br/>- Totally.
Hey, you know what? I'm not worried<br/>about a wild card at our wedding anymore.
Whether it's Uncle Vic,<br/>or Aunt Shelly or the ring bear.
Ring bearer.
Whether any of those mammals go rogue,<br/>our wedding is gonna be legendary.
No "wait for it"?
I've got you.<br/>I don't have to wait for it anymore.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
[LINE RINGS]
It's a long story, but if we don't beat my<br/>friend to that wedding, it's gonna be bad.
This is too stressful. I need to see Marvin!
No. You made me promise<br/>not to let you look. It's gonna upset you.
Here, have another Sum... Bitch.
No more Sumbitches?
Give me the damn phone!
[BOTH YELL]
- Go to "Edit" on the toolbar!<br/>- No, "Account Settings!"
- Just click on "Options."<br/>- Stop!
It can't be done.
That photo is etched in eternity.
Long after humanity's reign has ended,<br/>the only traces of our civilization...
...found by Earth's new ape masters<br/>will be the top of the Statue of Liberty...
...and this photo of me pretending to be<br/>ajudge with a banana gavel.
They'll probably like the banana thing.<br/>The ape masters.
Sorry.
Lily's gonna see it. We'll have<br/>the biggest fight of our lives.
Oh. I wish I could see your wife<br/>kick your ass.
I don't mean a physical fight.<br/>She's not an animal.
I'm sorry I tried to bite you.
I'm sorry I swatted you on the nose<br/>with a rolled-up magazine.
It's the only way I'll learn.
Look, I haven't seen my baby in a week.
You know what? Go for it.
It's gone. It's gone! You did it!
[GROUP CHEERING]
You did it! Ha-ha-ha!
- No new insulting Marvin photo.<br/>- Hm.
[VOICE BREAKING]<br/>No new insulting Marvin photo.
I know I'm just a stranger on a train<br/>who you tried to bite...
...but do you want a hug?
[CHATTERING]
[LILY YELLS]
Lily! What the hell?
Ted and I had some road-trip issues.
- Did he put on the gloves?<br/>LILY: Mm-hm.
The tackle was justified.
- What's this?<br/>- It's for you.
Don't open it.
With all the big changes coming up, I just<br/>wanted Robin to remember her friends.
We all want nothing but happiness<br/>for you and Barney. Right, Lily?
- Right.<br/>- Wow.
- That was what, eight years ago?<br/>- Yeah, eight years.
Thanks, Ted.
- I'm gonna get checked in.<br/>- Okay.
Marshall's flight just took off.
- My boys will be here soon!<br/>- Yay.
TED: Actually, Lily's boys were learning<br/>there was only one more flight to New York...
... with one seat left,<br/>all the way across the airport.
- You're not gonna tackle me again?<br/>- I'm the maid of honor.
There's a good chance that won't be<br/>my only tackle of the weekend.
TED:<br/>It wasn't.
Look, I'm sorry.<br/>I just got it in my head...
...that you somehow managed to track<br/>down that locket in Los Angeles...
...and were gonna blow up the wedding.
You really think I'm that crazy?
I guess that's fair.
Look, even though I was wrong...
...tell me you aren't thinking about doing<br/>anything insane this weekend.
Of course not.
And all I can say, kids, is at that moment,<br/>I really thought I meant it.
But the truth is...
... you never know who's gonna be<br/>the wild card at a wedding.
Hi. One ticket to Los Angeles, please.<br/>Ripped By mstoll

[<div class="full-script">So the hairdresser shows up at 2<br/>on Sunday.
Great. And while you do that,<br/>I'll check in on the ring bear.
I'm sorry,<br/>you're saying "ring bearer," right?
- Ring bear.<br/>- Look into my eyes and say:
"I promise that I'm not bringing<br/>a dangerous wild animal to our wedding."
- Ha, ha.<br/>- Hmm.
L...
[BUS BEEPING]
That's the shuttle<br/>with our elderly relatives pulling up.
There's nine steps<br/>between the bus and that door.
We've only got about 45 minutes<br/>until they get inside.
We won't have a moment to ourselves...
...once those old bastards<br/>latch onto us like leeches.
- But they're family and I love them.<br/>- Ha, ha. Our living link to history.
Oh, God, this is gonna be rough.
My great-grandparents<br/>never stop bickering.
But I guess that's what happens<br/>when you've been married for 60 years.
Sixty years.
Man, when was the last time<br/>you think they had sex?
Probably not since the Maple Leafs<br/>won the Cup. Ha, ha.
1967.
That's not gonna be us, right?
Like, when we get married,<br/>it's not all fighting, no sex?
What? No. Hey, it's us.<br/>R-Train and B-Nasty.
- That will never happen.<br/>- Heh.
[IN UNISON]<br/>We have to have sex right now.
Oh.
TED:<br/>Kids, as you recall...
... Uncle Marshall had gotten kicked off<br/>his flight home from Minnesota...
... and was hightailing it<br/>across the country...
... with another stranded traveler<br/>named Daphne.
- How's it going, baby?<br/>- Fine.
Except the flames of Lucifer<br/>keep singeing our back bumper...
...as we drive through this hellish,<br/>cheese-infested wasteland.
- Wisconsin?<br/>- Wisconsin.
Packers Country.
But don't worry...
...the Eriksen men are repping<br/>the purple and gold like two bosses.
Go Vikings!
- How are you doing, Daphne?<br/>- Not bad...
...considering Marshall's been spouting<br/>Vikings trivia for the last hour.
Do you know I Don't Care led the league<br/>last year in dumb sports stuff?
I should be back in time<br/>for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow.
Oh, the rehearsal dinner.
Daphne, you should've seen the dress<br/>I was gonna wear.
Up top, it packed the gals together like<br/>opening night of a Sex and the City movie.
And down south, it made mama look...
...like a dream Sir Mix-A-Lot<br/>would never wanna wake up from.
Ooh! What happened to that dress?
[SCREAMING]
The drunks at the dry cleaners<br/>destroyed it.
[SLURPS]
Thank you, Linus.
Okay, Lily, I have to go.
I have to alert the villagers<br/>that there is a Viking amongst them.
[BLOWING HORN]
- Marshall's driving through Wisconsin?<br/>- Yup.
Ooh, is that your toast?
- Uh, yeah.<br/>- Yeah, I'm just gonna wing mine.
Because if you get up there<br/>and speak from the heart...
...things good...
...mouth words...
...memory times.<br/>Can I take a peek at your speech?
No, uh...
"Have a drink with my favorite students.
See one last sunset over the Hudson."
Ted, your speech sucks.
Well, it's no<br/>"mouth words, memory times."
But if you must know, it's, uh...<br/>It's not a speech.
What is it then?
TED: A week before the wedding, I realized<br/>I couldn't stay in New York any longer.
So I decided to start fresh in Chicago.
It's a list of all the things I wanna do<br/>before I leave New York.
Okay, I don't know which I hate more,<br/>the fact that you're moving away...
...or the fact I'm the only one that knows<br/>about it. Why won't you tell anyone?
You don't drop a bombshell like that<br/>this close to a wedding.
That's an excuse. You have been avoiding<br/>Barney and Robin since the carousel.
And now on Monday,<br/>you're running away to Chicago.
I'm not running away. I'm moving on.
This list isn't written<br/>by someone who's ready to move on.
It's written by someone<br/>who loves New York.
I mean,<br/>"Fix graffiti on 96th and Amsterdam"?
I hated looking at it.
"Buy the whole bar a round of drinks."
Hey, everyone, next round's on me!
[ALL CHEERING]
ALL: Ted, Ted, Ted.<br/>- Yeah. Come on.
Ted...
Hey, everyone. Next round's on me.
- Can I have a double bourbon...?<br/>- No doubles.
"Say goodbye<br/>to the Empire State Building."
Bro.
What? Sometimes I go...
...talk to her about life.
And I just hate the thought of leaving you,<br/>Empy...
...but my gut tells me<br/>my future's in Chicago.
What do you think?
MAN:<br/>You need to move.
Oh, my God. Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You can't just stand there<br/>talking to a building and petting it.
Wait, are you one of those freaks<br/>who's sexually attracted to buildings?
An objectophiliac? No way.
Then why do you know<br/>what they're called?
Why do you know what they're called?
Wait. You know what would prove<br/>we're not some old married couple?
- Doing it somewhere we're not supposed to.<br/>- Huh!
Not what I mean.<br/>Like the elevator or the pool cabana.
- Uh, how about the roof?<br/>- Oh.
MORT:<br/>Who gets married this far away?
MURIEL:<br/>And the humidity.
[IN UNISON]<br/>They're here.
What do you say we make this bang<br/>a home game?
- We're locked out.<br/>- I guess we could try the back door.
- Huh!<br/>- Of our suite. There's a back door.
No, I locked it.
It's fine, we'll race down to the front desk<br/>and get a key before anyone notices us.
Too late. It's like we're in a zombie movie.
Seriously. They move at a slow shuffle,<br/>they moan a lot...
...and if given the chance,<br/>they chew your ear off.
- But they're family and I love them.<br/>- Their wisdom is priceless.
"Finally tell my upstairs neighbor<br/>how I've been feeling all this time."
Yeah.
Hi. Um, I live downstairs,<br/>and I've always wanted to say this to you...
...but I've never had the guts.<br/>And so here goes.
Are your shoes made of lead?
Because you are the loudest<br/>upstairs neighbor in history.
Oh, and you suck at the bongos,<br/>but, hey, heh, keep practicing.
In the middle of the night before<br/>any important interview I've ever had.
"Come clean about April 26th."
What happened April 26th?
Uh, ha, ha...
Can you believe<br/>people used to swim in those?
"Meet me at Coney Island, see.
I'll be doing the Charleston<br/>atop my giant-wheeled bicycle...
...in an era where folks<br/>inexplicably talked like this." Ha, ha.
Ted.
- Oh. Hey.<br/>- Hey, bud.
I was about to take Lily's<br/>rehearsal dinner dress to the dry cleaner.
Oh, that's too bad.
Because, uh, I was just watching<br/>The Princess Bride...
...when something occurred to me.
How, at the end, Andre the Giant<br/>hooks them up with those horses...
...and then Inigo Montoya is like,<br/>"Fezzik, you did something right."
And it's like, bro, Andre's been<br/>doing stuff right the whole movie.
Knocking out serpents,<br/>busting down castle doors.
Basically carrying your<br/>revenge-and-sangria-soaked ass.
So instead of being a patronizing jerk,<br/>how about a simple:
"Hey, thanks for the horses, bro"?
That's totally what you were thinking,<br/>right?
No, l... No, I came over here...<br/>God, that's a really good point.
- Yeah.<br/>- But here's my point...
...and your point.
Why haven't we done this in forever?
Ted, you know damn well<br/>why we haven't.
[ALL SHOUTING]
[IN UNISON]<br/>Sorry, Lily.
I almost killed my wife, Ted.
I almost killed my wife. I almost...
[GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
[IN SPANISH ACCENT]<br/>"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya."
[IN SPANISH ACCENT]<br/>"You killed my father."
BOTH:<br/>"Prepare to die."
[IN SPANISH ACCENT]<br/>You son of a bitch.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]<br/>I loved that dress you cut in half.
It was the perfect combination<br/>of slutty and classy.
- Well, what about your backup dress?<br/>- Oh, it's just classy, Ted.
[SLURPS]
Thank you, Linus.
- Look, I'm really sorry.<br/>- No, it's not good enough.
Since I'm being forced<br/>to wear something I don't want to...
...you should have to wear something<br/>you don't want to.
Why am I the only one being punished?
Marshall's just as responsible as I am.
Yeah, but he's in the middle of Wisconsin.<br/>How am I gonna punish...?
DAPHNE:<br/>Say, "Cheese."
[POLKA MUSIC PLAYING]
Go, Pack, go.
I'm sorry, Dad.
- There's gotta be someplace to bang here.<br/>- I'm starving. We should've hit the buffet...
Don't say "buffet."<br/>That attracts old people.
Same goes for "coupon," "60 Minutes,"<br/>and "Mandy Patinkin."
What? Robin, you're being paranoid.
Old people don't magically sense it<br/>when you say "Mandy Patinkin."
[ECHOING]<br/>Patinkin.
Oh, quick, the ice-machine room.
- It's too cold for them in there.<br/>- Oh.
I'll protect you, Robin.
You'll always be safe with me.
- Aah! Take her.<br/>- What...?
You bitches best get out<br/>of my hiding spot.
Well, the only thing not checked-off<br/>on this list is "Scotch with Barney."
That's the easiest one on here.
You are avoiding him.
I'm not. We've both been busy.
Besides, Marshall and I are<br/>saving that Scotch...
...to have a drink with Barney<br/>before the rehearsal dinner.
Because it's not just any bottle...
...it's a $600 Glen McKenna 30-Year.
TED:<br/>What I didn't know at the time was:
I told those idiots<br/>these death-rods are not welcome here.
What is it with dudes and swords?
- This is fun.<br/>- Oh, yeah.
And it's so cool when I go like this:
[IN SPANISH ACCENT]<br/>Hi. My name is Rodrigo DeGoya.
You killed someone I love.<br/>Prepare to dance.
TED: Yes, kids, that's what your Aunt Lily<br/>thought the line was.
[BOTH GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
[BOTH GASPING]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] We'll switch it<br/>with this cheap bottle of whiskey.
- You peel the label off the Glen McKenna.<br/>- On it.
Then we'll pour the... Robin.
Damn, that's smooth.
Pour it into the other bottle.
[SIGHS]
Wait, the colors aren't dark enough.
- Still not right. I think it was a little redder.<br/>- Mm-hm.
Okay, now the consistency's off.
[SIGHS]
Ehh.
Looks good.
I mean, look at that color.
It's almost chocolaty in its richness...
...with a reddish hue...
...and something that looks<br/>sort of clumpy.
Oh, yeah, I read about that.
Isn't the Highland region known<br/>for its clumps?
Thanks, Lily.<br/>I'm very aware of the Highland clumps.
Know what?<br/>Think I'm gonna sneak a taste.
What? But Marshall's not even here yet.
Ah. A quick nip won't hurt.
[CHUCKLES]
She's breathtaking.
- You avoiding the family too?<br/>- I'm gay, I'm black...
...and I'm getting a divorce.<br/>Those walking skeletons are gonna have...
...more questions for me<br/>than their pharmacists. Ha, ha.
But they're family and I love them.
- The greatest generation.<br/>- Smother me before I'm that age.
What are you two doing?
- We're trying to do it someplace naughty.<br/>- Huh!
Not what I mean.<br/>That is never what I mean.
We're trying to sneak in one last bang...
...because we're afraid that the magic<br/>might fade after we get married.
Are we being crazy?
That is what happened with me and Tom.
But it doesn't mean<br/>it's gonna happen to you.
I won't let it.
Wait, wait, you can't go out there.
It's suicide.
Consider it your early wedding gift.
Why does the brother always die first?
Aunt Muriel.
Aunt Muriel.
Aunt Muriel.
- James.<br/>- Where's Tom?
I have a gay question for you.
How do you decide which one?
- No, no, no.<br/>- No!
- He's gone, Barney. He's gone.<br/>- No, James.
You check the second floor<br/>for open rooms.
- I'm gonna check the gym.<br/>- No, no, no, that gym has a sauna.
My Papa Sid can't go 10 minutes<br/>without a schvitz.
- What about the gazebo out back?<br/>- Next to the lawn-bowling court?
Get you head out of your ass. It looks like<br/>they're casting Cocoon 3 out there.
- What about the business center?<br/>- A room full of computers? Perfect.
Technology is their<br/>compression-sock-covered Achilles' heel.
[BOTH GROANING]
- Stay safe, R-Train.<br/>- You too, B-Nasty.
Oh, my. I found Waldo.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
What's this list?
Whose is this?
TED:<br/>I was faced with a tough call.
Come clean about Chicago,<br/>or cleverly lie my way out of it.
Oh. Well, you see,<br/>mouth words, memory times.
It's mine. It's my list.
- It's everything I wanna do before I go to Italy.<br/>- Oh.
You wanna say goodbye<br/>to the Empire State Building?
Sometimes I go and I talk to Empy.
- That's kind of weird.<br/>- Is "weird" the right word?
Seems pretty reasonable to me.<br/>Maybe even kind of cool.
"Have a drink with my favorite students."
- Lily, you taught kindergarten.<br/>- That does seem pretty irrespons...
"Come clean about April 26th."
You told Ted about our sword fight?
- Wait, you guys had a sword fight?<br/>- Maybe a tiny one.
I was pretending to be Mandy Patinkin.
[ECHOING]<br/>Patinkin.
- But it was no big deal.<br/>- No big deal?
We destroyed<br/>their 30-year Glen McKenna...
...and replaced it with cheap booze,<br/>ketchup, and hand sani.
- I knew it.<br/>- You knew nothing.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?<br/>- The third floor's a ghost town.
Tons of empty rooms to bang in. Hurry,<br/>I've started without you. I mean, I love you.
I gotta go. Bye.
- We made it.<br/>- Ha, ha.
[BOTH MOANING]
Remind me to put a $5 bill<br/>in Barney's wedding card.
You know, to get them started.
[BOTH CHUCKLING]
MAN: No, Elizabeth. Leave the dentures in.<br/>ELIZABETH: Mm.
[IN UNISON]<br/>I never wanna have sex again.
Oh.
Blah.
They broke our $600 bottle of scotch?
Well, I'm not wearing<br/>this abomination anymore.
[POLKA MUSIC STOPS]
Put it back on.
[POLKA MUSIC PLAYING]
I can't believe my great-grandparents<br/>still do that.
I never imagined a walker being used<br/>for anything other than walking.
Plus, how about those balls<br/>dragging all over the ground?
- Barney.<br/>- No, the tennis balls...
...on the bottom of the walker.
Plus, his testicles were swinging<br/>like a broken yo-yo.
Still, when you think about it...
...married for 60 years and they still wanna<br/>jump each other's bones.
I mean, it's kind of sweet.
In 60 years, that'll be us, right?
Yeah. It will.
[CHUCKLES]
So, what do you think? Hmm?<br/>On the count of three?
- Mm. Okay.<br/>- Okay.
[IN UNISON]<br/>One, two, three.
Mandy Patinkin.
- Look at you.<br/>- Thank you for making it.
We got lucky.
The Farhampton liquor store<br/>is actually pretty high-end.
And their security's a total joke.
Thanks.
And thanks for not telling Robin<br/>the list was mine.
But I don't get it.<br/>You're so against me moving...
...why'd you help me out?
For a guy who loves New York this much,<br/>to leave it...
...you must really need to go, huh?
Yeah. I really do.
Okay.
But there's still one item left on this list.
- Time to check it off.<br/>- Yeah, I should probably wait for Marshall.
Well, we both know<br/>he may not get here in time.
Be honest.
Have you been avoiding Barney?
Maybe a little.
This is the biggest weekend of his life<br/>and you're his best bro.
No matter how awkward you feel...
...if you're not there for him,<br/>you will always regret it.
- Hey, Ted?<br/>- Yeah?
You wrote down all these things<br/>to say goodbye to...
...but so many of them are good things.
Why not just say goodbye<br/>to the bad things?
Say goodbye to all the times you felt lost.
To all the times it was a "no"<br/>instead of a "yes."
To all the scrapes and bruises.
To all the heartache.
Say goodbye to everything you really want<br/>to do for the last time.
But don't go have one last Scotch<br/>with Barney.
Have the first Scotch<br/>toasting Barney's new life.
Because that's a good thing...
...and the good things<br/>will always be here waiting for you.
- What?<br/>- Turn the page.
"Get one last life lecture from Lily."
You're dreaming<br/>if you think that's the last one of those.
[SIGHS]
Ah. Been waiting<br/>for the perfect time for this.
- And, my friend, that time is...<br/>- I saw you and Robin at the carousel.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">TED: Kids, it was two days before<br/>Barney and Robin's wedding...
... and everything was going off<br/>without a hitch.
Ah. I've been waiting for the perfect time<br/>for this. That time...<br/>Ripped By mstoll
I saw you and Robin at the carousel.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
TED:<br/>Okay, there was one slight hitch.
BARNEY: She called me to help her,<br/>and there you were...
... in the rain, holding hands<br/>with my fianc?e.
What up?
Nothing up.
Everything down. All parts of me down.
Look, you were busy...
...so I went to the park to help her look<br/>for this locket she buried years ago.
She couldn't find it, she got upset,<br/>I held her hand. End of story.
Cool. I just wanted to air that out,<br/>you know, bro to bro.
You're my best friend and my best man.<br/>Of course I trust you.
Oh, come on,<br/>you don't have to cry about it.
[SOBBING]
It's not that.
That was a $600 bottle of Scotch.
Oh, my God.
[BOTH SOBBING]
I hope Marshall gets here<br/>for the rehearsal dinner.
Thank you, Linus.
He's somewhere in Wisconsin<br/>in a rental car.
- Hertz?<br/>- I mean, it hurts a little...
...but I'm not gonna cry about it. Hey!
We've been doing that all afternoon.
ROBIN: Who's that for?<br/>- Marshpillow.
TED: Kids, as you may recall,<br/>whenever Marshall left town for a few days...
... Lily would compensate with a body pillow<br/>she dressed up and named Marshpillow.
Pretty normal stuff.
But with Marshall stuck driving across<br/>the country, Lily decided to upgrade.
Meet Marshpillow 2.0.
Yay.
Am I on?
- Hey, guys.<br/>ALL: Hey, Marshall.
It's like you're really here.
Hey, Ted, can you give me a gander<br/>of the environs?
Wow, this place looks beauti...
Wait for it.
He's frozen.
Same thing happened last night<br/>at the worst possible time.
I had just gotten on all fours<br/>and taken off my pantie...
Now Lily's frozen.
- Ful. This place is beautiful.
Wow, Lily, looks like you really put<br/>some time into this, huh?
Though I wonder if instead of dressing up<br/>your giant husband doll like Malibu Ken...
...you could have spent a minute or two,<br/>I don't know...
...planning the weak-ass<br/>bachelorette party you threw me.
It's possible I forgot to send out the Evite.
Robin, happy bachelorette party.
You invited Patrice<br/>to my bachelorette party?
No.
You know, it's funny, when I was planning<br/>Barney's bachelor party...
... I managed to wrangle his boyhood hero,<br/>Billy Zabka from The Karate Kid.
But you scored Patrice.
I'm sorry, Robin. I've just been<br/>so consumed with our move to Rome...
...I guess I forgot to invite the girls.
I'd like to show you how it's done.
Billy Zabka, what a great guy.
Look at how thorough Ted was...
...planning the poker game<br/>he's throwing for Barney.
Wait, I think I'm on some sort of delay here.
Ahem. "Best Man" visor for the dealer.
Customized playing cards.
Barney's the king.
And the queens are naked.
It was my first decree.
Plus Ted handwrote all of the table cards<br/>for the reception in calligraphy.
The man's a wizard with a pen.
Oh. Ha, ha. I don't know about all that.
Though I was approached<br/>by the decorating committee...
...to make the signs for our senior prom.
I'm told they were quite the hit.
[HISSES]
Hey, buddy, listen, you're gonna kill me,<br/>but I forgot to bring the table cards.
Uh, I'd hate to ask you to re-do them...
Say no more. The best man is on it.
Thanks, Ted.
So now the best man is painstakingly<br/>handwriting 200 table cards...
...but my maid of honor forgot<br/>to click "send" on an Evite.
I didn't forget to invite the girls<br/>to your bachelorette party.
You have no girls.
What?
What?
What?
What? L... All my girls.
I gave you a list.
- This list?<br/>- Yeah.
"Tall girl from work.<br/>Mouth-breather from coffee shop.
Average-sized girl from that place."
Ooh, sorry I didn't track her down.<br/>She sounds great.
She's actually kind of a bitch.
Face it, Robin, you hate women<br/>and women hate you.
Ted didn't go to his prom? Classic.
TED: While Lily was dropping the ball<br/>as maid of honor...
... the best man was busy<br/>knocking it out of the park.
[HISSES]
Hey, buddy, listen.
My Great Aunt Ida has corns on her feet<br/>and needs a first-floor room.
Uh, would you mind switching rooms...?
- Say no more. The best man is on it.<br/>- Thanks, Ted.
[BOTH SHOUTING]
Hey, buddy, listen.
The wedding doves got here early<br/>and I don't know where to put them...
- Say no more. The best man is on it.<br/>- Thanks, Ted.
Poor guys.
All cooped up.
I guess there's no harm in letting you out<br/>for a bit, huh?
They carpet-bombed my entire room.
I wish I'd closed my suitcase.
And my mouth.
Hey, buddy, listen.
I see you wrote "N-O-period"<br/>instead of the number sign.
- That might confuse the guests...<br/>- Say no more. The best man is on it.
Thanks, Ted.
Here they are, freshly penned table cards<br/>in a pretty decent Chancery...
...considering I only had my travel quills.
Wait, why has the poker game started?
Oh, um, the best man moved the time.
- No, he didn't.<br/>- Yes, he did.
Hey, Ted. Thanks for the sweet lid, bro.
Billy Zabka is your new best man?
He's the best around.
Sorry, Ted. Maybe next wedding.
You're playing the best man poker game<br/>without me?
Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?
I'm Barney's personal tailor.<br/>Of course I'm here.
Plus I've never played poker before.<br/>It looks like a hoot.
I moved into a dungeon.<br/>I wrote hundreds of cards.
I even gave your batty Great Aunt Ida<br/>a foot massage so vigorous...
...it put her to sleep in the lobby.
Yeah, I don't really have a Great Aunt Ida.
So you are mad about me<br/>and Robin holding hands.
Of course I'm mad, Ted.
Holding hands is like the fourth grade<br/>equivalent of banging.
Well, in your case, 12th grade.<br/>Self-five.
- You broke the Bro Code.<br/>- No, I did not.
I only went to help Robin as a friend<br/>because you didn't show up.
- I did not break the Bro Code.<br/>- It's in the text:
"A bro shall not have a weird moment<br/>with another bro's fianc?e."
Too bad we're in Farhampton<br/>and can't actually check.
I'm pleased to announce the Bro Code<br/>has replaced the Gideons' Bible...
...at select hotels throughout the country.
- I'm sorry I said you hate women.<br/>- Don't be.
For whatever reason, I just...<br/>I can't seem to connect with them. Down!
Can you help me? I've got a bunch more<br/>wedding gifts in the van.
Yay, I love Robin so much.
God, I'm gonna strangle that bitch.
Robin, what is it with you and women?
Ugh. They're so annoying.
I'm glad that you're my<br/>only female friend.
Girls are always whining<br/>and crying over every little thing. Ugh.
[SOBBING]
Yes. Yes, exactly. Thank you.
"Boo-hoo, look at me.<br/>I'm a sensitive little girl..."
I'm sorry, you're actually crying. Ugh.
It is just so sad.
I can't be your only girlfriend.
Well, I don't need anybody else.<br/>I got you.
For another six days,<br/>and then I'm off to Rome for a year.
What are you gonna do<br/>without our Saturday morning brunch...
...with a side of sassy gossip?
A one-shot power play?
Hey, Boston,<br/>why not drop your hockey pants...
...and actually take a dump on the ice<br/>next time? Aah!
I love it. Ha, ha.
Ugh. See? It is just too horrible<br/>to even think about.
- Yeah.<br/>- You need another female friend.
Whenever I try to talk to women,<br/>they look like they want to punch me.
Well, maybe you're accidentally giving off<br/>the wrong vibe.
Like, what do you say to other women<br/>at the gym?
Oh, I haven't been to the gym in forever.<br/>My metabolism is all messed up.
See, I can moose down a pint<br/>of fudge ripple for a midnight snack...
...and wake up having lost weight.
Well, everywhere except for my boobs.
So annoying.
You're gonna need a lot of work.
It's in here somewhere. It has to be.
Damn it. I should've done these<br/>in alpha-bro-tical order.
Who cares about the Bro Code?<br/>It's just some stupid book you made up.
[GASPS]
How dare you?
The Bro Code has been around<br/>for centuries. Nay...
...whatever's more than centuries.
- Don't launch into a fake history lesson.<br/>- The Bro Code can trace its lineage...
...all the way back to Broses himself.
Article 1: Bros before ho's.
Okay, I see what you're doing.
You can't prove I broke the Code,<br/>so you're making up...
This sacred text was eventually brought<br/>to the New World in 1776...
...by none other than<br/>Christopher Brolumbus.
Article 62:
A bro who calls dibs first has dibs.
Oh? Dibs.
And that's why he got<br/>to bang Pocahontas.
- Pocahontas was with John Smith.<br/>- Maybe according to the hotel register.
Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus didn't know<br/>couldn't hurt her, right?
Except maybe that New World syphilis,<br/>but I digress.
Barney, if you believe in the Bro Code,<br/>how come you've broken it so many times?
[GASPS]
How dare you?<br/>I have never broken the Bro Code.
Hmm, hmm, ah!
"Article 104: The mom of a bro<br/>is always off-limits."
Okay, look. We've all had a lot of fun<br/>joking about me banging your mom.
Not all of us. Continue.
But I swear nothing ever happened<br/>between the two of us.
- Trust me.<br/>- Then what's going on with your fingers?
That's how our bodies were intertwined.
All right, this is ridiculous.
It's ridiculous you won't admit<br/>holding Robin's hand was weird.
- It wasn't weird.<br/>- Yes, it was.
You know what? We need a third,<br/>impartial bro to settle this.
To resolve this, I really need to parse<br/>the text of the Bro Code.
Too bad Marshall doesn't have a copy.
Actually, I do.
They were in the seat-back pockets<br/>of my flight in place of the safety cards.
I'm also pleased to announce<br/>the Bro Code is now available...
...in select airlines across the country.<br/>And Lufthansa.
Der Bro Code is, like, huge in Germany.
Okay, so prove to me<br/>you can make a female friend.
What about her?
Ugh. The girl with the bangs?
Any chick who does that to her hair<br/>is going through a big life transition...
...I don't wanna hear about.
Next time grow your bangs long enough<br/>to cover your mouth. Pass.
Okay, well, what about her?
ROBIN:<br/>Ugh. Comfortable shoes?
Ha, ha. What, are you filibustering later?
It's after 5, put on some heels. Pass.
Okay, well, what about...?
- Ugh.<br/>- I haven't even pointed to anyone yet.
Now, although not expressly stated<br/>in the Bro Code...
... a weird moment between a bro<br/>and his bro's fianc?e...
... is, in my bro-pinion, a violation.
- No.<br/>- Yes.
However, Ted was helping Robin<br/>as a friend.
Therefore holding her hand<br/>isn't necessarily a weird moment.
- No.<br/>- Yes.
That being said...
... if we decide that holding any friend's hand<br/>is weird...
... then, yes, Ted did break the Bro Code.<br/>So the question is this:
If Ted had gone to the park<br/>and held Barney's hand...
... would it have been weird?
- Yes.<br/>- No.
See?
It's not weird at all.
- I don't know what to say.<br/>- Just be yourself. Say something nice.
Which one? I can't do both.
Heh. Slut alert.
That's my 14-year-old daughter.
Crappy mom alert. Ugh, it's you. Nice bangs.
- What is wrong with you?<br/>- Look, I can't do this, okay?
I was raised as a boy.<br/>I don't get along with women.
Can we just drop it?
Okay, I never thought I'd take a page<br/>out of your fianc?'s playbook...
...but it's time to target the crying chick.
Not weird at all.
Marshall, why are we doing this?
Two dudes on a beach with a lifeless blob<br/>they're pretending is alive?
It's stupid.
So I guess that means<br/>Weekend at Bernie's is stupid too.
E- lawyered.
Now, before I can render a decision...
... we need to re-create the variables<br/>at the carousel as closely as possible.
Since Ted says that he was comforting<br/>Robin, he needs to do the same for Barney.
So, Ted, comfort Barney.
I don't see how that...
Comfort Barney.
Barney, what is going on with you?<br/>Why are you so upset with me?
Marshall, this is stupid. I don't...
- Accept the comfort.<br/>- Fine.
I guess I'm not really mad at you.<br/>I'm mad at myself.
I should have met Robin at the carousel<br/>when she called...
...but I was having such a good time<br/>greasing 12-year-olds.
- Laser tag.<br/>- Helpful. Continue.
Look, Ted, I'm sorry that<br/>I've been taking it out on you.
You were just being a good friend<br/>to Robin.
It's okay.
It would be different if you still had feelings<br/>for her, but you don't, right?
Right?
[THUNDER CRASHING]
Okay, now it's weird.
You still have feelings for Robin?
What? What? What?
Wha...? Okay, yeah, sometimes I do.
- Then turn them off.<br/>- I'd love to, but it doesn't work that way.
I'm a human being.<br/>I don't have an off switch.
I'm shutting off.
There, there.
Sister.
Who needs a lady hug?
Ugh. What the hell are you doing?
- Wait, did you just ugh my hug?<br/>- I don't need a hug.
I'm pissed off because the Rangers<br/>just lost to the Boston Bruins.
[IN UNISON]<br/>I hate the Boston Bruins.
[BOTH CHUCKLING]
Look, I hate these feelings.<br/>I hate myself for having these feelings.
No one wishes they would go away<br/>more than I do.
But I just... I can't seem to make<br/>that happen. I've tried.
Well, then try harder.<br/>I'm marrying her in less than two days.
What the hell are we gonna<br/>do about this?
TED: As she watched Robin make a new friend,<br/>Lily was happy.
For two seconds.
- Oh, no.<br/>- Come on, ref.
I haven't seen that much hooking go<br/>unpunished since my last trip to Vegas.
And I was on that trip,<br/>because we're best friends now.
[BOTH CHUCKLING]
Hey, this might sound a little nutty.
But how about we inject a sexual edge<br/>into our abiding friendship that...
BOTH: In no way jeopardizes our emotional<br/>connection or respective marriages?
- Hell, no.<br/>- Excuse me.
I've got a Boston brewing,<br/>if you know what I mean.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
You listen and you listen good.
If I see your face around Robin again...
...you'll be crying about a lot more<br/>than your precious New York Rodgers.
- Rangers?<br/>- I will cut you.
[GRUNTING]
Forgot my purse.
You know what?
That's why I only need you.
Because you're a psycho.
My psycho.
- I am, aren't I?<br/>- Mm-hm.
[CHUCKLES]
- There's the blushing bride.<br/>- Back off, Patrice!
Look, Barney, the truth is,<br/>it was weird at the carousel.
On some level, it's probably been weird<br/>ever since we broke up.
But you're my brother.<br/>I would never do anything to hurt you. Ever.
I mean it. I swear.<br/>I'll even swear it on the Bro Code.
- The Bro Code's stupid.<br/>- Huh! How dare you?
I'd be honored.
I can't promise that I'll ever get to a place<br/>where it won't be at least a little weird...
...between me and Robin.
But I don't want to lose you as a friend.<br/>Either of you.
So I will do everything I can<br/>to move on and live with it.
The question is, can you?
I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do this.
I fold.
What about the best man?
I fold too.
I fold.
There goes my belly buster.
You sandbag all night only to bluff<br/>a couple of rags pre-flop...
...and wind up with a dry board.
That's what you get for limping in<br/>short-stacked with a pack of donkeys.
Muck city.
- I fold.<br/>- Oh, right. I knew that.
I knew that, I knew that.
Okay, two players left.
- You're bluffing, robot man. I raise.<br/>BARNEY: Oh.
Hey, Billy, do you mind pushing my chips<br/>into the center of the pot?
Preferably with gusto, because I'm all in!
[ALL SHOUTING]
TED:<br/>All right, all right.
[ALL SHOUTING]
TED: And that's how I became Barney's<br/>best man again.
Everything was back to going off<br/>without a hitch.
I'm coming for you, Mosby.
TED:<br/>Okay, there was one slight hitch.<br/>Ripped By mstoll
</div>]

[<div class="full-script">Ooh! Chicago, there is this pizza place<br/>called Gazzola's, it's fantastic.
It was closed for a while, but reopened.
I'm sure they got a Godzilla's in New York.<br/>We're not stopping.<br/>Ripped By mstoll
It's just pizza.
Just pizza?
Let me tell you about<br/>the thing you say is just pizza.
We begin with the first bite.<br/>Oh, the crunch.
And then the marinara, that roiling lava<br/>of tomato and oregano, it overtakes you.
I'm falling.
And that's when she catches you.
That chewy, voluptuous mistress,<br/>mozzarella.
Her oven-kissed cheeks<br/>crackle with warmth in your mouth...
...cradling the sauce and the bread,<br/>letting you know that from now on...
...this is home.
This pizza...
...is home.
If it was so delicious...
...why'd they close it in the first place?<br/>- Rats.
- We're not stopping!<br/>- This road trip sucks!
TED: Barney's bachelor poker game<br/>was winding down. Tim Gunn, out.
Lily, busted.
Marshpillow, fluffed and turned down.
We were playing what we thought<br/>was our final hand, it was getting intense.
Action to Ranjit.
Ranjit, action to you.
What?
Hey, Ted, thanks again for your gift.
He gave us a framed photo<br/>of all of us at the bar.
And he's getting us<br/>two other wedding gifts.
What can I say?<br/>I just love giving wedding gifts.
I love giving wedding gifts so much<br/>I wish I could marry giving wedding gifts...
...and then get myself and<br/>giving wedding gifts a wedding gift.
Maybe saying things like that's<br/>why I'm not married.
TED: Oh, you know what?<br/>I should explain why Lily was angry.
Six years earlier,<br/>a few weeks after their wedding...
... Marshall and Lily<br/>were going through their gifts.
That's weird. Did Ted get us anything?
Come on, Lily, I mean, Ted's our best friend.<br/>If his gift hasn't arrived yet, it's on the way.
TED:<br/>But time passed and no gift arrived.
Finally, Marshall started dropping hints.
Hey, man, it was great<br/>having you at our wedding.
Thanks, bro. And thanks for this coffee.<br/>It is great.
You were not wedding absent. No, sir.
You were wedding present.
Do I detect a note of hazelnut?
[CHUCKLES]
Wedding present.
I think he got it.
TED:<br/>But I didn't get it.
More months passed.<br/>His hints got more desperate.
- Happy Halloween.<br/>- What are you supposed to be?
Well, I'm a wedding present, Ted.
How could you not get me<br/>a wedding present?
I mean, how could you not get<br/>that I am a wedding present?
Get me? A wedding present.
Get me a wedding present.
Why isn't he getting it?
I don't know, why didn't you<br/>get the message...
...to dress up like a pregnant teenager,<br/>home skillet?
TED:<br/>But he kept on waiting.
Until the summer of 2008<br/>when I got engaged.
So Ted's getting married, huh?
Bet he'd love a gift from his old pal<br/>Marshall. Well, he can forget it.
We're getting them a gift.
But Lily, this is the dream. The whole<br/>reason we wanted Ted to get married.
So we could not give him a gift,<br/>he'd know exactly how it feels.
Baby, I'm as pissed as you are,<br/>but we're getting them a gift. We have to.
Fine.
We'll get them a gift.
A gift that'll send a message<br/>loud and clear.
A gift-wrapping station.
Oh, boy, this time he has to get it.
TED: And not long after that,<br/>a package arrived.
Well, well, well, package<br/>from one Mr. Ted Mosby.
It's a little late, but...<br/>What the balls is this?
It's a thank-you note<br/>for the gift-wrapping station.
TED:<br/>Which explains the face.
Wedding gift.
Hey, Barney,<br/>I've got a wedding gift for you too.
Don't get married. Ha, ha!
In fact, it comes in his and hers.<br/>Don't get married.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]<br/>Don't get married. Ha, ha.
I'm not cheating. Don't tell anyone.<br/>I'll cut you in on half.
Hey, Barney, can you ask James<br/>to stop crapping all over marriage?
- He's not crapping on marriage.<br/>- He literally drew this on the toilet.
Robin, please don't ask me to pick sides.
In two days<br/>he's gonna be your brother too.
Just be honest and tell him<br/>what's bothering you.
Okay.
- Vroosh!<br/>- Marshall, are you...?
Hey, Andretti, beat it.
Marshall, are you sitting down?
I'm in a car. And you were pretty clear...
...about the No-Teen-Wolfing-Now-That-<br/>I'm-A-Dad rule, so yeah, I'm sitting down.
Ted is getting Barney and Robin<br/>three wedding gifts.
I hate him.<br/>Lily, requesting permission to make a stink.
Stink away.
Hurry up and get it over with.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh. That's Marshall. I should take this.
Well, call me Akira Yoshizawa.
World's most famous origamist?
I fold.
Don't worry, it's just a play on words.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]<br/>Barney. Here's a good one.
What's the difference between<br/>a Journey song and a husband?
A Journey song has a climax. Ha, ha.
I'm sorry, Robin. I'm just messing with you.<br/>Raise a hundred.
No, it's fine. It's just funny<br/>hearing all this anti-marriage stuff...
...from a divorced guy<br/>who still wears his wedding ring.
- What, this?<br/>- Mm.
Only wear it because nothing attracts<br/>a gay guy faster than a wedding ring.
Except saying hi to him.<br/>Or being in the same room.
Or every app on my phone.
People, it is a good time to be gay.
So you could just take that ring off<br/>any time you want?
Any time.
I'm all in and I raise you...
...one ring.
ALL:<br/>Ooh.
Fine. It's just a ring.
Okay, let's see what you got.
Robin has three jacks.<br/>James has just shy of a pair of sixes.
Thank you.
I'm gonna hit the gym.<br/>Let me know if you wanna get dinner.
We'll give you a ring. Just not this one. Ho!
[CHUCKLES]
You, Ted Mosby, never got me<br/>and Lily a wedding gift. J'accuse!
I did too get you a gift.<br/>It was a coffeemaker.
And you never sent me a thank-you note.
Oh.
So me-cuse?
You-cuse.
When I said be honest<br/>and say what's bothering you...
...I meant stuff it, never do anything.<br/>How'd you not get that?
It's fine. He's a grown-up.
[DOOR OPENS]
What did you do to my little boy?
[THUNDER CRASHING]
Hi, Mom.
- You get your brother's ring back.<br/>- Please don't make me take sides.
That's your brother out there. You two<br/>shared bunk beds and baseball mitts...
...and when you were hungry,<br/>these supple breasts...
Arguably a little too long.
Stinsons stand up for each other.
Take care of this.<br/>I'm gonna play some cards.
All right, chumps.
I'm gonna tell you what I told Frampton's<br/>guitar tech when he couldn't find a condom.
Let's gamble.
You gave us a coffeemaker?
Not just a coffeemaker. I asked what<br/>they used at your favorite coffeehouse...
...and got you that exact<br/>one-tier-down model.
And you know what you got me? Huh?
No thank-you note.<br/>So I started dropping hints about it.
Do I detect a note of hazelnut?
Wedding present.
Kind of wanna say thank you<br/>to that note of hazelnut.
Thank you, note.
Ha, ha. Wedding present.
Anyway.
Thank-you note.
Yeah, he got it.
But you never got it.
I drank so much coffee that year<br/>hoping you'd take the hint...
...my resting pulse was like the drum solo<br/>from "Wipe Out."
And then Halloween rolled around.
Get me a wedding present.
On that note,<br/>I think you'll like my costume.
I'm a thank-you note.
- Thank-you note.<br/>- Ah.
I guess you could say<br/>that we sort of go together.
That's right, Marshall.
That's right. When someone gets you a gift,<br/>you give them a thank-you note.
- That is how it works.<br/>- Give a gift, get a note.
- Agreed.<br/>- Exactly.
Exactly.
- Exactly.<br/>- Exactly.
I think he got it.
Yeah. Yeah, he got it.<br/>I have to find the bathroom.
- I didn't get it.<br/>- I thought for sure you'd get it...
...when I sent that note<br/>for the wrapping station.
Dear Marshall and Lily...
... this is a thank-you note<br/>to thank you for the gift-wrapping station.
Because even though the wedding<br/>never happened...
... there's one thing that didn't leave me<br/>at the altar and that's my manners.
I can't believe this.<br/>Eriksens send thank-you notes.
It's the one thing that we always do.
We even have a family saying about it:<br/>"Lick it before you stick it."
"It" being the stamp on the thank-you note<br/>before you stick it in the mailbox.
I will make this right.
I know, right?<br/>We're about to go through a tunnel.
Guys, big dilemma.
My mom's insisting<br/>that I get Robin to give James his ring back.
But Robin's refusing.
But James seems like he's really upset.
But Robin's gonna be my wife.
But James is my brother.
But Robin lets me do sex to her.
But I have to spend eternity<br/>in my mom's mausoleum.
I just wish there was a way<br/>I didn't have to take sides.
What should I do?
Choose your wife.<br/>You always choose your wife. Easy.
Got any other stumpers, like how to answer,<br/>"Does this make me look fat?"
Maybe a little around the hips,<br/>but no more than usual.
You're getting married, I'll deal<br/>with that one after your honeymoon.
TED:<br/>And she did.
Belize was amaz... Aah!
In marriage, being right<br/>is less important than being supportive.
Remember, happy wife equals happy life.
Wow, thanks, that's some great advice, Lil.<br/>I knew I could count on you.
He's gotten very respectful with his fake<br/>listening. Anyway, Lily, I told Marshall this...
...but don't worry about not sending a<br/>thank-you note for the coffeemaker. It's cool.
Uh, we did send a thank-you note<br/>for the coffeemaker.
Uh, no, you didn't.
Uh, yes, we did.
To Stuart and Claudia.
The people who gave us<br/>the coffeemaker.
Uh...
What?
- Hey, you two.<br/>- Hey.
Hey, thanks again for that coffeemaker,<br/>we use it all the time.
Especially when Ted's over.
Yeah, it's a great machine.<br/>We have one at home and we love it.
Did I forget to get you a wedding gift?
What kind of monster am I?<br/>Mosbys always give wedding gifts.
We even have an expression:<br/>"Wrap it before you tap it."
You know, wrap the gift...
...before you tap the person on the shoulder<br/>and say, "Here's your gift."
I will make this right.
Two things. Number one,<br/>are you dropping heat right now?
- No.<br/>- Great.
Number two.
- Nice.<br/>- Thanks.
Anyway, I came up with an amazing plan<br/>that I think will make everyone happy.
Step one, you let my mom<br/>win the ring back in a hand of poker.
Step two...
No, that's all the steps.<br/>What do you think?
So your plan is you do absolutely nothing<br/>to get your fianc?e's back?
Okay, let me propose a different plan.
Step one...
Good game, everybody. Ha, ha.
And that's all the steps.
That's a really pretty bra, Mom.
Well, I'd better leave now<br/>before I lose any more of my dignity.
The likelihood of which is increasing<br/>every moment in this very chilly room.
Not good, Robin. Very not good.<br/>How do you keep winning, anyway?
Well, to the keen observer, all of you<br/>Stinsons have the same very subtle tell.
Whenever you're bluffing,<br/>you say the word "bluff."
Hey, I'm hungry,<br/>should we get some bluffalo wings?
Raise you 20.
When I walked in,<br/>I saw an all-you-can-eat bluffet.
Raise 50.
Mm. I could use a bluffberry muffin.<br/>A blueberry bluffin. Sorry.
A bluebluffy muffbluff. All in.
I don't believe it. Robin, you've got to<br/>give her that blouse back.
She loves that blouse.
She got those sequins from<br/>Rick James' open casket.
Nope. Not happening.
Woman, as your bridegroom,<br/>I command you.
We'll leave and give you guys<br/>some privacy.
You, uh, wanna take back<br/>that "I command you" thing?
Please, can I?
Why is this so important to you?
Because it's my family.
And so help me, you and I will never have<br/>sex again if you don't give back their bluff.
Stuff. Damn it.
Look, I just... I wanna feel like you're<br/>on my side once in a while. That's all.
Look, I'm gonna be your wife,<br/>for God's sakes.
But look,<br/>if it's that important to you, here.
Do what you want.
Thank you.
And please don't play<br/>strip poker with my mom again.
It's all kinds of confusing.
[SIGHS]
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Oh. That's where my phone is.
I wasn't eavesdropping. Hey, baby.
Lily, we were wrong the whole time. Ted got<br/>us the coffeemaker. He's a wonderful man.
Wait, no, Claudia and Stuart<br/>gave us our coffeemaker.
Ted's a rat bastard.<br/>Never mention his name again!
Coffeemaker? Ted got that.<br/>I was with him when he bought it.
- I don't know what to feel.<br/>- But Stuart said he got it for us.
Stuart and Claudia checked in.<br/>I saw them in the lobby.
Let's go get to the bottom of this.
Stuart, no BS, did you really get us<br/>that coffeemaker for our wedding?
Of course.
What a crazy thing to ask. They never<br/>give you enough of these things.
Oh, my God, Ted got us that coffeemaker,<br/>and you just played it off as your gift.
- You're a weasel. Admit it.<br/>- No. That's insane.
Really? Housekeeping. Conditioner thief.
Okay, yes, I am a weasel.
I ripped the card off Ted's gift<br/>and I wrote my name on it.
Does Claudia know about this?
No. Please don't tell her.
That gift was a turning point for us.
I gotta admit, I came pretty close<br/>to leaving you.
Bags packed, plane ticket purchased...
...topless pics sent to your brother,<br/>the whole nine.
But seeing that you got our friends<br/>such a nice gift, ugh...
...it just really puts you<br/>in a whole new light.
I'm a pretty great guy.
And since that day,<br/>on the foundation of that coffeemaker...
...we've built a strong,<br/>nurturing relationship.
Well, out of respect for your marriage,<br/>I won't say anything.
Say hi to Claudia<br/>when she gets out of the shower.
That's not Claudia. Good night.
Tap, tap. Look what I wrapped.
What?
So I went to give James his ring back?
Glad you came to your senses.
You can't let being married<br/>keep you from being you.
It's like Tom, always telling me<br/>I spend too much time at the gym.
Is it wrong if you wanna<br/>work out a couple times a week?
Right? Or a couple times a day?
Or a couple times...? A couple times a day?<br/>Really?
A few hours before work,<br/>a few hours after.
Only way to keep up<br/>the chocolate xylophone.
[MIMICKING XYLOPHONE]
Still, that's a lot of time at the gym.
Especially with two kids.
It's like I always said to Tom.
I've gotta stay in shape<br/>in case I'm ever single again.
And, hello, I was right.
Oh, my God.
I think I finally understand what Lily was<br/>mumbling in my peripheral vision earlier.
I'm marrying Robin<br/>so I can be part of a team.
Not just some guy alone at a gym<br/>with admittedly amazing abs.
- Thanks, bro.<br/>- No. Thank you, bro.
You're not getting this ring.
I am always gonna have your back.<br/>No matter what.
Thank you.
- I love you.<br/>- I love you too.
Mm, oh! I didn't tell you the best part.<br/>There's more.
Really?
James, let me spell this out for you.
Now that I've got Robin,<br/>we are not brothers anymore.
- What?<br/>- Ha, ha.
If you and Robin are both ever hanging<br/>from a cliff and I have one hand free?
Enjoy the fall. Bye-bye.
If you... Mom, good,<br/>you should hear this too.
This mother-son thing, it's over.
It's been a nice few decades, but I've got<br/>a wife now, so you mean nothing to me.
Oh, and me coming over<br/>for Thanksgiving and Christmas?
That's done. No more of that.
And you know why?<br/>Because Robin said so.
This came directly from her.
See you, losers.
- Oh, my God.<br/>- Ah?
Fianc? of the year?
- Ha, ha. I think I know what's next.<br/>- Oh, God.
Oh, God, I can't leave this room<br/>for the rest of the weekend.
I'm sure we can find<br/>something to do, eh?
MARSHALL: Ted, I'm so sorry.<br/>- No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have spent six years passive-<br/>aggressively drinking coffee around you.
I shouldn't have taken that sewing class<br/>to learn to make that present costume.
- I regret all of it.<br/>- Me too.
Except I actually don't regret<br/>that sewing class.
I learned a fun and useful lifetime skill.
But seriously,<br/>even without the coffeemaker...
...you've given us more than enough.
Well, there is one more gift on the way.
Whatever it is, send it back.
It's a little late for that.
- Marshall Eriksen?<br/>- Yes?
I got your pizza.
Ted. You are the best friend ever.
Don't say another word, Marshall.
Save it for the thank-you note.
You got it, buddy.
TED: And kids, I got that thank-you note.<br/>Four months later.
Four months.
Here's your blouse back.
Is there any way we could just, um,<br/>forget about all this?
No, dear, you keep the blouse.
Think of it as your consolation prize.
Consolation prize?
You won the battle...
...but I'll win the war.
Game on, bitch.<br/>Ripped By mstoll

Look at this, your wedding weekend.<br/>Ripped By mstoll
I know, this close to finally having sex<br/>again. It's been forever.
- You and Robin been abstaining?<br/>- Talking about you.
Here's the deal. Every hookup at a weekend<br/>wedding is decided at Friday night drinks.
Get stuck with the wrong girl tonight...
...the only action you'll get all weekend is<br/>a self-five. And I don't mean the cool kind.
Self-five. That's the cool kind.
- Huh. It's a big decision.<br/>- The biggest.
It brings to mind that religious text<br/>which we hold most sacred.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
Remember? They entered a chamber.
Really? I'm the one working with the Nazis?
Ted... Just... Just... Okay?
They had to choose which cup<br/>was this special cup.
I forget what it was called,<br/>it was the Holy Grail of cups.
- It was the Holy Grail.<br/>- Of cups, exactly.
So the Nazi confederate chose, and...
[WHISPERING] Don't make me do that,<br/>I'd rather...
- Ted, Ted, the confederate Nazi chose and...<br/>- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Okay. Okay.
And now I'm gonna explode.
He chose poorly.
Then Indy picked a cup, and...
You chose wisely.
[UP-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
So choose wisely, Ted.
To help you decide, I spent all day<br/>yesterday picking your top three prospects.
And I helped. It was either that<br/>or writing our vows. Ugh. Gag.
Sophia was Robin's college roommate.
And she's apparently<br/>"a bit of a screamer in the sack."
Yeah, mid-sex, she sounds exactly<br/>like a car alarm from the '90s.
You know:
[MIMICKING CAR ALARM]
Dudes love it.
Cassie is the daughter<br/>of my mom's best friend.
Sad story, 12 years ago, her gymnast career<br/>was tragically cut short...
...when her boobs got too big.
Grace is a new co-worker.
She's had six different positions<br/>at the firm.
- And that was just at the Christmas party.<br/>- Ooh.
So Grace doesn't arrive till later,<br/>I recommend Sophia.
I strongly feel<br/>that you should strongly feel her.
Well, I guess it's decided then.
- Ted, right?<br/>- Yeah.
I'm Cassie.
Something tells me that we are gonna<br/>have a lot of fun this weekend. Ha, ha.
Cassie. I pick Cassie.
You chose poorly.
Hey, there's our minister.
What a sweet-Iooking old...
Aah. He looks scary.
Looks can be deceiving, Lily.
But not in this case.<br/>He's a mean old tool.
Oh. He can't be that bad.
I'll get him to come around.
Yeah.
Hi, Reverend, I'm Lily Aldrin,<br/>the maid of honor.
Not too much honor.
You're dressed like a whore.
[MOUTHING]<br/>He loves me.
Why aren't you telling your wife<br/>you got an offer to be ajudge?
Lily had her heart set<br/>on us moving to Rome.
So I have to tell her in person.
That way, I know that I can convince her<br/>we need to stay.
In the courtroom,<br/>they call me "The Convincer."
They really call you that?
I convinced them to call me that.
But you prepare for your court cases.<br/>Did you prepare for talking to Lily?
I don't need to prepare, okay,<br/>I can craft a nice...
Thingy.
Oh. Wow, I am totally...
The twisty metal thingy?
- You're screwed.<br/>- I'm screwed.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know.
I'm just so tired of this routine.
We flirt, we have a few drinks and then<br/>we end the night with meaningless sex.
Oh.
Yeah.
Me too.
Do you wanna start the night<br/>with meaningless sex and then flirt later?
You are a visionary.
- Ha, ha.<br/>- Come on.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Oh! Oh.
It's work. Should I get it? Or ignore it?
Or get it? Oh! Or ignore it?
Or get it?
- You know, go ahead, get it.<br/>- Okay. Ahem.
Hello?
You chose poorly.
I'm fired?
But teaching there was my dream job.
And you guys are my only friends.
You all hate me?
Can I at least say goodbye to my kids?
My kids all hate me?
[CRYING]
Oh. It's okay.
So, what were we about to do?
I think it was, uh, meaningless something?
Meaningless socks?<br/>No, it wasn't meaningless socks.
Hey, hi, hi, hi.
Um, so little problem.
I was trying really hard<br/>not to offend your minister.
- So how did you and your husband meet?<br/>- Oh.
It was our first week of college.
I needed help hooking up my stereo...
... so I walked down the hall and I just knew<br/>I should knock on this one door.
Marshall opened it. It was destiny.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
We've been together ever since.
Excuse me.
What did I do wrong?
What did you do wrong?
Okay, we really wanted him to marry us.<br/>His church has cute coming out the wazoo.
But when we met with him...
No pets in my church.
No casual attire in my church.<br/>No gum. No sports logos...
...particularly the Orlando Magic.<br/>- Reverend? More like never-end. Prayer five.
No shouting. No cell phones.
I'll warn you that I turn down<br/>most wedding requests.
Particularly from boozy,<br/>promiscuous Manhattanites...
...who only want me to marry them because<br/>my church has "cute" coming out the wazoo.
- People are like that?<br/>- That is the total opposite of us.
Well, then, how did you two meet?
Oh, um, um...
We've been dating since college.
We met the very first week.
I needed help hooking up my stereo...
... so I walked down the hall and I just knew<br/>that I should knock on this one door.
BARNEY:<br/>I opened the door and it was destiny.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
[IN UNISON]<br/>We've been together ever since.
You stole our story of how we met?
We had to. Your story is so sweet.<br/>You didn't even kiss till the third date.
By our third date, I'd hit more bases<br/>than Bob Hope on a USO tour.
Topical.
Now Reverend Lowell<br/>knows we lied to him.
What if he cancels our wedding?
What? That's ridiculous.
Barney, Robin, I need to speak with you<br/>in private immediately.
And it's not just losing my job.
My carjust got stolen with all my stuff in it.<br/>And now I think I'm getting the flu.
I'm sorry, I've been talking<br/>for, like, half an hour.
It's fine. Forty minutes, it's fine.
Still, I think I'd be able to handle all of this...
...if my boyfriend, Wesley,<br/>hadn't just broken up with me.
[SOBBING]
Why don't you tell me about it?
Okay, I should go back to the beginning.
No, before the beginning.
- Winter, 1998...<br/>TED: Man, this girl is a drag.
If I hurry, I bet I still have a shot<br/>with Sophia.
Okay, I'll get one more drink with Cassie,<br/>then bail.
But where, bar or dining room?
- Bar or dining room?<br/>- For my fourth date with Wesley, we went...
Cassie, let's get one more drink<br/>in the dining room.
You chose...
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
Hey. We just ordered appetizers.<br/>Sit down, you two.
Poorly.
You're walking into the biggest fight<br/>of your life.
You have to be prepared.<br/>You have to be tough.
- I am tough.<br/>- No, you're not.
You make good points.
What are you gonna say to Lily<br/>when you walk through that door?
Okay.
Hey, baby.
- So, listen, I got this phone call...<br/>DAPHNE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You haven't seen her in a week.<br/>Where's the, "I missed you"?
How about a kiss?<br/>Nothing about her new hairstyle?
- Hairstyle? I can't actually see...<br/>- Start over.
Lily. Hi.
I missed you<br/>and your hairstyle so much.
DAPHNE:<br/>I missed you too.
I can't wait to show you how much<br/>in bed tonight.
- Okay, that's creepy.<br/>DAPHNE: Don't break character.
Okay. Um...
So, listen, I got this phone call last week<br/>and l...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Acknowledge<br/>her own views on the matter first. Start over.
Lily. Hi.<br/>I missed you and your hairstyle so much.
DAPHNE:<br/>I missed you too.
Okay, so, I know that you're excited<br/>for Rome.
DAPHNE:<br/>I'm more excited for bed tonight.
While I was away, uh,<br/>I got a phone call to be ajudge.
DAPHNE:<br/>What the damn hell?
- Lily does not say, "What the damn hell?"<br/>- Well, I've never met her, but, yes, she does.
- You make some good points.<br/>- Wow. You are terrible at this.
- Why'd we lie?<br/>- We have to come clean.
- Frankly, I am appalled.<br/>- I know. L...
Your friend Lily just tried to pass off your<br/>sweet story of how you met as her own.
- That lying little tart.<br/>- I am horrified and relieved.
Does Lily have any problems<br/>that you're aware of?
- Drinking.<br/>- Drugs.
BOTH:<br/>She's been drinking drugs.
Well, I talked to Barney and Robin<br/>and let me say, I am shocked.
You should be.
Flat-out lying to me like that?
We are not misunderstanding each other.
How dare you pretend their beautiful story<br/>is actually your own?
Come again for Lil' Fudge?
I understand the temptation.<br/>They're such a sweet couple.
I mean, the way they call each other<br/>Barnmallow and Robinpad.
Ha, ha. Ah.
Yes, I do steal their stories.
But only because my husband and I<br/>are so ashamed of how we met.
See, we only met because his friend Ted<br/>fell in love with me.
And who could blame him?
Hey, Marshall, see that girl?
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.<br/>Go say hi.
I can't go say hi. I need a plan. I'm<br/>gonna wait till she goes to the bathroom.
Hi. Have you met Ted?
- Hi.<br/>- I'm sorry, I can't...
LILY: And now, after years of lying, cheating,<br/>and back-sliding, here we are, married.
But what can I say?
My husband's a sociopath<br/>who's slept with over a hundred women...
...and I'm a slut who once<br/>let my boss feel me up.
- Oh, come on, it is over 250 women.<br/>- I felt him up!
If you two want to get<br/>married in my church...
...you'll stop breaking<br/>the 9th Commandment.
- No fat chicks?<br/>- Thou shalt not lie.
With fat chicks?
You're killing me. You're killing me.
Now, that was a good dessert.
Dessert sounds like desert...
...the desert has sand...
...there's sand at the beach...
...and Wesley and I<br/>once drove by a beach.
[CRYING]
Excuse me.
TED:<br/>Now's my chance to leave.
No, I'll wait five more seconds<br/>so I don't seem too eager.
Four, three, two...
Thanks for keeping our daughter company.<br/>She can be a drag, huh?
We're gonna go have a little fun.<br/>See you.
You're on fire tonight, bro.
But, Lily, being ajudge is my dream job.
DAPHNE: So your dream job's<br/>more important than my dream job?
Exactly. Now you're getting it.
Nope. Start over.
DAPHNE: So your dream job's<br/>more important than my dream job?
But, baby, you already have<br/>the best job in the world: Mom.
Nope. Start over.
DAPHNE: So your dream job's<br/>more important than my dream job?
Hey, I gave up<br/>peeing in the shower for you.
Nope. Start over.
DAPHNE: So your dream job's<br/>more important than my dream job?
Of course not.
But this isn't just about our future,<br/>it's about everyone's.
As a lawyer, I couldn't stop big oil from<br/>polluting, but as ajudge, well, maybe I can.
And that's why I took the job.
You've just been Convincer-ed.
DAPHNE:<br/>Wait. You already took the job?
Without even talking to your wife?
Start over. Start over. Start over.
What the damn hell?
Hi, Reverend Lowell?
Whoo! Made it through my half. You're up.
Uh, the truth is, we have a complicated,<br/>messy history that we're not too proud of.
But we're sorry that we lied,<br/>and hope that you can forgive us.
Nope. I can't do it.<br/>You're going to have to find a new officiant.
Okay, well, these things happen.
- And a new church.<br/>- What the damn hell?
TED:<br/>This evening could not get any worse.
- Whenever you're ready.<br/>TED: Crap.
Hey, Ted. Thanks for being so great.<br/>I'm lucky to have you around this weekend.
Ooh. Yeah. About that.
I should really go see about the, uh...
- So sex?<br/>- My room is very close.
Sophia. Hi.
Oh, God, Wesley.
Wait... Wait, you're Wesley?
Hey, Cassie. Your parents were just saying<br/>you have a new boyfriend.
"Boyfriend"'s a little premature.
Though I did pay for dinner.
Ted and I are very happy.
- Are we?<br/>- Even if he'll never replace you.
[SOBBING]
So, Sophia, hi, I'm Ted.
Robin's friend.
What do you say we give these<br/>old flames a chance to catch up...
...and we could get a drink?<br/>- Are you hitting on me?
- Dude.<br/>- Ted. Let's go.
You tip...
...poorly.
Look, I know, I shouldn't have<br/>taken the job without telling Lily.
- Why are you so ticked off about it?<br/>- I know what she's going through.
I always dreamed of having a career<br/>I could be proud of...
...but my husband never supported me.
Eventually I had to...
...make a choice.
Now every day I'm out there,<br/>I'm fighting for the good guys, and I love it.
Doesn't your wife deserve that too?
Wow, um, maybe you're right.
I didn't realize<br/>how many sacrifices you'd made.
- What is it you do, anyway?<br/>- I'm a lobbyist for a big oil company.
What the damn hell?
I'm an environmentalist.<br/>It's why you don't want me to be ajudge.
You're the reason I have to become<br/>ajudge! You're the devil incarnate.
And outcarnate. Every kind of carnate.
Please, is there any way<br/>you'd reconsider?
No. No. No.<br/>You two are both terrible people.
Who found each other<br/>in this crazy world.
And who lie about<br/>how they found each other.
Please, leave now. Just...
[GROANS]
You know what? You're right,<br/>we shouldn't have lied about our story.
I love our story.
Sure, it's messy, but it's the story<br/>that got us here, about to get married.
I love it too.
Every messy chapter.
I love that you slept with over 250 women<br/>before deciding that I was your favorite.
- This is killing me.<br/>- And I love...
...that we had to keep having sex<br/>with each other...
...even when dating other people.<br/>- It's really killing me.
I love that your marriage proposal<br/>involved a strip club...
...lying to me, and pretending<br/>to bang the woman I hate for two months.
I love that we keep a tally<br/>of different rooms we've had sex in.
I love that two weeks ago,<br/>we put this room on that list.
Ah. Come on, rev, that's worth<br/>some kind of reaction.
I mean, right where your hymnal is,<br/>is where we... We...
[CHUCKLES]
Well, that's not what you want.
[CASSIE SOBBING]
Are you okay? I think maybe seeing<br/>your ex was a bit much for you.
No, not at all. I want only you.
Oh, yeah. I want to rock your world.
You're so hot.
I want to ride you like a bronco.
Okay, Cassie. Cassie.<br/>Yeah, we can't do this.
I mean, you're crying.
And contagious.
You're having a really, really bad week.
I think you should just take it easy.
- You're right. I'm not in a good place.<br/>- No.
Oh, wow, I probably would have let you<br/>do all sorts of crazy things to me.
Exactly.
I release you.
Go have fun this weekend.<br/>Meet someone else.
TED: Yes, yes! Be cool.<br/>- Okay.
TED:<br/>But I couldn't meet someone else.
Hey, Ted, everyone here is saying you<br/>and Cassie are the couple of the weekend.
How great is that?
TED:<br/>Barney was right. I had chosen poorly.
Everyone had seen us together,<br/>and now the whole weekend seemed lost.
Until...
Hi, I just got here.
Did I miss anything?
Not at all. Grace, right? I'm Ted.
Let's get you a drink before<br/>you talk to anyone else or hear anything.
Hey, guys. How's your night going?
Ugh. Our ministerjust died.
We can use the church, but we have<br/>two days to find a new officiant.
Unless...
- "Wedding at Bernie's."<br/>- We're not doing "Wedding at Bernie's."
Oh, that's terrible.
Should I make a toast in his honor?
[MOUTHING]<br/>No, no, no.
Of course I should.
Everyone? To Reverend Lowell.
He may have passed away tonight,<br/>but he will always...
Uncle Robert died?
Oh, no.
[CRYING]
Have a nice weekend.
TED: All that night,<br/>I did nothing but choose poorly.
But thanks to Cassie, I didn't get together<br/>with anyone at that wedding.
And if I had, well, then...
... your mother and I<br/>might never have met.
So maybe, in a way, I chose wisely.
[SOPHIA MIMICKING CAR ALARM]
TED: Although it sure as heck<br/>didn't feel like it at the time.
She chose Wesley.
Ha, ha. I've been dying<br/>to say that one all night.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Truth is, you're right. It was wrong<br/>of me to take that job without telling Lily.
I don't need to be tough with her.<br/>I need to be fair.
Thanks, Marshall.
I should also apologize.
While you were filling the tank...
...I may have been so angry,<br/>I texted your wife...
...with the news<br/>that you took that judge offer.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

- You texted Lily that I took the job?<br/>- You're welcome.
You were torturing yourself figuring out<br/>how to tell her, I broke the ice.
I was standing on that ice.
Now I'm gonna be bobbing<br/>face down on a frigid creek.
I do not need to know the nasty way<br/>you apologize to your wife.
And frigid?<br/>Maybe you're just doing it wrong.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hi, baby.
I can't believe you did this behind my back.
- I should've talked to...<br/>- Thanks to you, we're stuck all weekend...
...in the room with a ghost in it.<br/>- Room with a...?
We got 13? The room that's haunted<br/>by the ghost of Captain Dearduff?
We got the who to what, now?
TED: Marshall had recently discovered that<br/>the Farhampton Inn was featured...
... in an episode of<br/>The Ghost Network's original series...
...True and Real Ghost Stories<br/>of the Supernatural.
There, see? The Farhampton Inn.<br/>I told you it sounded familiar.
NARRATOR: In 1843, the streets of Farhampton,<br/>Long Island...
... were stalked by a vicious killer<br/>named Captain Blazeby Dearduff.
Dubbed Dearduff the Hooker,<br/>he murdered dozens of unwary travelers...
... with his sharpened hook.
Ironically, that hook would prove<br/>Dearduff's own undoing...
... one wintry night<br/>in Room 13 of the Farhampton Inn.
[FLY BUZZING]
Uh-oh.
NARRATOR: He was found the next morning<br/>frozen to death.
MAN:<br/>Boom.
NARRATOR: Some say you can still hear Captain<br/>Dearduff's cries coming from Room 13.
Cold. So cold.
Help me. Help me.
MAN:<br/>We can see you, Ron.
NARRATOR: Some say you can<br/>still hear the thump of his peg...
... and the scrape of his hook.
Others say Dearduff the Hooker was just<br/>a popular male prostitute...
... who murdered no one<br/>and died of syphilis in 1848.
Let's hear from some people who have<br/>actually survived a night in Room 13.
Did I see a ghost?
[DISTORTED] Of course. Yes.<br/>There are such things as ghosts.
So have you seen the ghost?
Not yet, but that might just be because<br/>ghosts don't exist, Marshall!
So explain the night shirt we saw flying<br/>around our cabin in the Poconos.
An owl got stuck in it.<br/>We saw it fly out the neck hole.
Yeah, the ghost of an owl<br/>that died in that cabin.
Plus, it's a crappy room,<br/>but when I tried to complain...
The thermostat in my room is broken,<br/>the AC won't turn off.
Ooh.
Sounds like the work of Captain Dearduff.<br/>He brings with him the icy chill of death.
So bad luck there.
Night-night.
Sounds like you're using Captain Dearduff<br/>as an excuse for a crappy room.
I beg your pardon.
I did not get to be a 40-year-old night clerk<br/>by making excuses.
If there's anything wrong that isn't<br/>ghost-related, I'm happy to address it.
Okay, the Wi-Fi doesn't work.
- Ghosts interfere with electronic devices.<br/>- The shower's leaking.
Dearduff likes the sound of dripping,<br/>reminds him of his bleeding victims.
And the door won't lock.
Captain Dearduff doesn't want<br/>to be locked out of his room.
Why would a locked door keep a ghost out?<br/>Can't they walk through walls?
Maybe he's afraid of rats.
There are rats in the walls?
No.
And the inn's booked up because<br/>of the wedding so we can't change rooms.
Oh, that sucks.
I'm sorry, baby.
If Dearduff does manifest,<br/>you know the way to harvest ectoplasm?
- Good news. All set for the dove release.<br/>- What?
When we leave the church,<br/>they're gonna release 100 doves.
It's going to be avi-wait-for-it-ary.<br/>Aviary.
- Oh. That might be a problem.<br/>- Why?
When we leave the church,<br/>a few of the gun enthusiasts in my family...
...are going to fire a 21-gun salute.
[GUNFIRE]
Oh, look, one got away...
[GUNSHOT]
- Can't your guys just fire blanks?<br/>- At a wedding? Ha, ha.
Yeah, that's romantic.
[THUNDER CRASHING]
WOMAN:<br/>Did I see a ghost?
[DISTORTED] Of course. Yes.<br/>There are such things as ghosts.
[SCREAMING]
Ooh. Ah.
Ted? What the hell are you doing<br/>in my room?
Uh...
TED:<br/>There was an explanation.
You see, after Marshall got off the phone<br/>with Lily, he had called me.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hey, buddy, what's...?<br/>- Ted.
Sneak into Lily's room, find her phone<br/>and delete the last text she got.
- Why? What's...?<br/>- I need you to do this, no questions asked.
And as we both know,<br/>you owe me a "no questions asked."
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hey.<br/>TED: Hey. Listen.
I need you to do something for me,<br/>no questions asked.
- What is it?<br/>- Meet me at the corner of 53rd and Eighth.
Bring your drill.
Marshall.
What the hell?
- How did you...?<br/>- No questions asked.
I broke federal law drilling you out of that.
Hey, I was a man in need.
I know, you were a "Priority Male."
You said you'd stop doing that joke...
...after the editor of<br/>Bazooka Joe comics rejected it.
That man is a comedy snob. The point is,<br/>you owe me a "no questions asked."
- Okay, okay. I'll delete the text.<br/>- Thank you.
I just have to figure out<br/>how to get into Lily's room.
Easy. The lock on her door is busted, so...
- The drain pipe.<br/>- What?
There's a drain pipe near her window.<br/>And no big deal, I can totally climb it.
- I'll call you when it's done.<br/>- Her door is unlock...
Uh, Marshall wanted me to check on you.
He was worried that you might be scared<br/>all alone in the ghost room.
Remind me to call you next time Marvin<br/>has a nightmare.
You can calm him by bursting into his room<br/>with a chainsaw and a hockey mask.
I didn't want to knock<br/>in case you were asleep...
...so I just climbed the drain pipe,<br/>no big deal...
...and opened the latch<br/>with this coat hanger.
I would've called, but, uh, I didn't know<br/>if you'd have your phone handy.
Say, where is that old phone of yours?
Ted, I am not scared, so why don't you<br/>head back to your room and...? Aah!
I guess you can stay until I fall asleep.<br/>If it'll make you feel better.
And if it'll make you feel even better, you<br/>can sing me a version of Marvin's lullaby?
Okay. Okay.
[SINGING]<br/>Night-night, little Lily
No ifs, ands, or buts
No peg-legged ghost is waiting<br/>To hook out your guts
- Ted.<br/>- Sorry. Sorry.
Nighty-night.

MAN:<br/>Cold.
So cold.
Help me.
Help me.
Oh, God, the Hooker's here.
Ted, I'm not gonna cheat on Robin.
But you're a hell of a best man<br/>for getting me one, buddy. Where is she?
All right, I'll take a lap dance.<br/>Can I borrow some sweatpants?
Barney, what are you doing in there?
Marshall asked me to do something for him,<br/>no questions asked.
Sidebar: I forgot to get my cousin David<br/>something for his Bar Mitzvah last week.
- Could you send the hooker to his room?<br/>- Marshall called you too?
TED:<br/>Turns out I wasn't Marshall's first call.
- Can't your guys just fire blanks?<br/>- At a wedding? Heh.
Yeah, that's romantic.
- I wish I'd known about the guns.<br/>- I wish I'd known about the doves.
We don't think about checking with the<br/>other person before doing something.
Honestly, I think that's what broke us up<br/>the first time.
We're both Ione wolves,<br/>always off in our own worlds.
That's not gonna work.
Not in a marriage, no.
What? I was thinking about<br/>getting the doves Kevlar tuxedos...
...but that's not gonna work,<br/>no time for fitting.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hey.<br/>- I need you to get to Lily's phone...
...and delete the last text she got.
- Why? What did you...?<br/>- I need you to do it, no questions asked.
As you'll recall, you owe me<br/>a "no questions asked."
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hello.<br/>- Marshall, rush to Macy's in Herald Square.
Find the utility closet on the third floor.<br/>Bring me the following:
A clean pair of underwear, clean<br/>pair of pants, box of moist towelettes...
...hand sanitizer, and a garbage bag.<br/>No questions asked.
You deuced your pants.
Never mind.
You didn't wind up helping me,<br/>so it doesn't count. Face.
I'm the one who should be embarrassed<br/>by that story.
But that wasn't the time I meant.<br/>This was last fall.
Hey, I got here as fast as I could.<br/>You okay?
Yeah, fine. These quacks said I was<br/>"unfit" to leave on my own. Blah, blah, blah.
"Danger to myself. Blah, blah, blah.
Whoever signs me out<br/>is legally responsible for my act..."
- I need you to sign me out.<br/>- What happened?
Ah-ah. I said no questions asked.
Star, clover, horseshoe.
Barney, did you swallow real versions<br/>of all the Lucky Charms items?
No questions asked.
Let's hit the bar, I'm buying.<br/>I won $50 from an Irish guy on a dare.
Fine, I'll delete the text. How am I<br/>supposed to get into Lily's room?
- Easy. The lock on her door is busted...<br/>- Air ducts.
- What?<br/>- I'll use the air ducts to get into her room...
...just like the bad guy in Die Hard.
Barney, Bruce Willis is not<br/>the bad guy in Die... Not important.
- The door is not lock...<br/>- Call you when it's done.
Anyway, I was saying, we need to be better<br/>about talking before doing stuff.
Can't talk. Doing stuff.
[GRUNTS]
What is going on?
What are you doing in there?
Uh, well, there is a story there.
It involves a trained Guatemalan kinkajou,<br/>a Bolshoi Ballet prima ballerina...
...and Olympic gold medalist, Duke<br/>Kahanamoku's surfboard. Tell her, Ted.
Uh, uh, uh...
- The kinkajou...<br/>- The kinkajou...
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Oh, God, what is it now?
Good evening, Ms. Aldrin.
I didn't order room service.
It says right here.<br/>Room 13: Lobster, caviar, champagne.
Four hundred dollars?<br/>I didn't order any of this.
Maybe Dearduff the Hooker ordered it.
Well, I'm not paying for room service<br/>the Hooker ordered.
I've been there.
LILY: Okay, you know what?<br/>I need to talk to the manager.
All right, where's that damn phone?
You too?
[SCOFFS]
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Hey.<br/>- Robin, I need you to delete the last text...
...Lily got before she sees it.<br/>- Bro, it's my wedding weekend.
Just because you take a naked selfie<br/>while in the coldest part of the country...
First, I'm an Eriksen.<br/>Cold has a plumping effect.
Second, you owe me<br/>a "no questions asked."
All right, I'm at the alley<br/>near 22nd and 2nd. Now what?
ROBIN: No questions asked. Tell me about<br/>the giant trout you and your dad caught.
Well, it was more beast than trout...
...fought us for three hours and nearly<br/>dragged us both into Lake Winnibigoshish.
It was this big, and...
Hey. Run!
I never asked who those weirdoes<br/>were, why they called you "Night Falcon"...
...or what was in those<br/>darts they were blowing.
Your vision came back, didn't it? Huh.<br/>Wuss.
Fine, I'll take care of it. Just have to figure<br/>out how to get into Lily's room.
- Her door doesn't lock. You can just...<br/>- Room service.
Night Falcon, you're a genius.<br/>I'll call you when it's done.
Why would he call you guys before me?
Dude, you're not great in a crisis. What was<br/>that story you were prattling on about?
- What is a kinkajou?<br/>- Let's find it before she gets back.
I'm sorry, ma'am. You ordered it.<br/>You have to pay for it.
Not to mention the room damage<br/>you're responsible for. I've got a report:
Broken lock, faulty Wi-Fi, you've taken<br/>several items from the minibar.
- There is no minibar.<br/>- Stolen minibar.
Wait, it's not here.
Well, where else would it be?
Okay. I think it's time I call my lawyer.
Uh-oh.
We need to get to Lily's phone before<br/>she sees that text.
- On it.<br/>- Night Falcon on it.
Good thing I packed my unitard.
Wait.
- This is what we always do, isn't it?<br/>- Yeah.
We were both gonna bolt off and Ione-wolf it<br/>without telling the other person a thing.
- Why do we do that?<br/>- I don't know.
Maybe we're just incapable<br/>of working as a unit.
You know, I bet even Ione wolves<br/>can learn to work together.
I'd like to think so.
They could build<br/>their little woodland den together.
- Roam together.<br/>- Hunt together.
Lure prey into a tight corner and...
[IN UNISON]<br/>Snap its limbs with our powerful jaws...
...and watch the life drain from its eyes.
BOTH:<br/>Aw.
Point is, we're gonna make a great team,<br/>we'll just need some practice.
Yeah. Let's prove<br/>that we believe in marriage...
...by working together to help<br/>Marshall hide something from his wife.
First, we take position in the lobby.
BARNEY:<br/>Then, you cause a distraction.
ROBIN: Then you send in a trained dove<br/>to grab Lily's phone.
BARNEY: The dove drops the phone<br/>into your hand, you delete the text...
... and toss it back on the counter.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Wait. It's absolutely insane<br/>how foolproof this plan is.
Sometimes it's best to just go simple.
[COUGHS]
Why do you have a gun?<br/>Why do you always have a gun?
- Where's Lily?<br/>- She went up 20 minutes ago.
You're kidding.
Courtney Dove, no.
I already lost Kurt Coo-bain,<br/>I can't lose you as well.
How are we gonna get<br/>Lily's phone now?
Oh. I already took care of that,<br/>and now I'm rewarding myself...
...with the inn's finest brandy.
- Bottoms up.<br/>- Well, thank you.
That's a warning.<br/>The dove's about to...
[DOVE COOING]
- What happened?<br/>- Well...
I think it's time I call my lawyer.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
- Hi, baby.<br/>- You are never gonna believe this, but...
- Someone sent me a text.<br/>TED: Lily, stop.
- Why?<br/>- Because...
Because...
TED: And that's when I realized that the answer<br/>had been there all along.
Throw your phone on the ground,<br/>smash it.
- What? No. Why would I?<br/>- I need you to do this, no questions asked.
You owe me a "no questions asked."
- Hey, Lil. What's...?<br/>LILY: I need you to come to my classroom...
... with two dozen cupcakes and a box cutter.<br/>No questions asked.
Lily? I brought the...
Oh, my God.
Ted, put the cupcakes at the feet<br/>of their leader, then cut me loose.
Don't make eye contact.
- Ted...<br/>- No questions asked.
Well, interesting that I was the one<br/>who fixed everything...
...even though Marshall called me third.
TED: Ninth, as I found out later,<br/>but I won't go into it.
The important thing is what happened right<br/>after the untimely death of Lily's phone.
So you didn't order room service...
...and you didn't order<br/>Prison Sluts Nine?
I am saying I did not order room service.
It is done, by me, your third call.
Actually, you were...<br/>Thank you. How did you do it?
I called in a "no questions asked" with Lily.
Why didn't you?<br/>You must have a million.
TED:<br/>And Marshall thought back.
- Hello?<br/>- Hey, baby, it's me.
Can you come bail me out ofjail?<br/>I thought I saw a bigfoot in Central Park...
...and so I tackled him,<br/>but it turned out to be Russell Brand.
Hey. Oh, do you mind<br/>looking up our vaccination records?
I tried to hug a raccoon.
Hey, babe, um,<br/>could you dig up our warranty?
I took the TV apart<br/>and I made a robot out of it.
- Hello?<br/>- Hey, I tackled Russell Brand again.
I've never asked Lily to do anything<br/>no questions asked because...
...I never wanted to.
She's the love of my life.<br/>I never keep anything from her.
Ted, put Lily on the phone.
Hey. It's Marshall.
Wanna tell me what's going on?
Yes. I was offered ajudgeship in New York.
And I took it. Even though<br/>we'd already agreed to move to Rome.
I'm gonna be ajudge.
Lily?
You know, Marshall,<br/>I don't believe in ghosts.
And I'm not sure anyone died in our room.
But someone's going to.

♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x08 ♪<br/>The Lighthouse<br/>Original Air Date on November 4, 2013
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<br/>@elder_man
Kids, not far<br/>from the Farhampton Inn,
there's a lighthouse.
It's a really special place,
and that morning<br/>I wanted to see it for myself.
There was just one problem.
Look, I'm sorry, Ted, but-but
I can't in good faith send<br/>a lonely guy like yourself
to the top<br/>of a very romantic,
and more to the point,<br/>a very tall lighthouse.
I don't want your blood<br/>on my hands,
and I mean that literally,<br/>because it would be my job to...
to hose down the rocks.
Now, late the night before,
thanks to Marshall's<br/>travel companion, Daphne,
Lily had received<br/>some unsettling news.
I'm gonna be a judge.
Screwing up their<br/>whole plan to move to Italy.
She wasn't happy.
Yes, I'm in a rotten mood.
No, I don't want<br/>to talk about it.
Yes, this has<br/>booze in it.
No, it's not<br/>my first.
You want to make this brunch<br/>a drunch?
You do you, I'm not gonna judge.
I'm gonna be a judge.
Judge.
Thank you, Linus.
As for Marshall and Daphne,
they got caught<br/>in that big storm.
Luckily, they had a place<br/>to crash for the night.
My childhood home.
Okay, that sign<br/>might not have been there.
Thank you so much for letting<br/>us stay the night, Mrs. Mosby.
Oh, it's our pleasure.
I'm just glad that storm has passed.<br/>Oh.
But there's one storm<br/>that hasn't passed,
isn't there, Marshall?
Hey, Clint.
You know what I'm talking<br/>about, don't you, Marshall?
I'm talking about the one<br/>that's been raining
cats and dogs all over<br/>this-this, this friendship.
This isn't a friendship.
Oh.
Nice.
We're reluctant<br/>travel companions.
Well, little known fact<br/>about me.
I'm an almost-graduate
of the Conflict Resolution<br/>program over at... at Tri-C.
I even had my own practice<br/>at Van Aken Plaza
before the manager<br/>of the Wendy's
made me stop hogging the booth.
The point is,<br/>I can fix this.
Oh, I don't know, Clint.
♪ Gonna resolve some conflicts
♪ Gonna resolve<br/>some conflicts ♪

Okay, you know what?<br/>We have to hit the road.
But, um, Mrs. Mosby, do you<br/>mind if I take this mug?
I would very much like
to make fun of Ted<br/>next time I see him.
Of course.
You know, when Ted was seven,
he and his best friend<br/>took this Wild West photo
together at Geauga Lake.
I could go look for it.
We really should get going.
His best friend was a balloon.
What's a few more minutes?
Yeah, you're gonna want that.
So... what's everyone<br/>doing this morning?
Oh, well, I kind of feel<br/>like playing some tennis.
Maybe we should reserve a court.
Court.
Thank you, Linus.
Pancakes and eggs, Robin?
I guess that blouse won't be<br/>loose and flowy for long.
Mom...
Keep talking, Loretta.
I've been waiting<br/>all morning to...
ketchup.
Oops.
You're not supposed to put<br/>ketchup on scrambled eggs.
Right, Loretta, because
you're the queen<br/>of scrambled eggs.
Actually, that's
exactly what she is.
When Mom was
a groupie in the '70s,
her scrambled eggs made her the<br/>darling of the MSG loading dock.
Lot of songs written<br/>about those scrambled eggs.
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"?
Originally "She's Got Eggs."
Led Zeppelin?
"Scramble On."
Steve Miller?
"The Yolker."
If you listen to Pink Floyd's<br/>Dark Side of the Moon
while eating her eggs,<br/>it lines up perfectly.
While I'm sure it was<br/>your mother's cooking skills
that made her so popular with<br/>Zed Zed Top and their ilk,
I know for a fact
that she does not make<br/>the best scrambled eggs.
Because my mom makes<br/>the best scrambled eggs.
Kids, we've known<br/>your Aunt Robin
for eight years at that point,
and here's what we knew<br/>about her mom.
My mom is terrified<br/>of flying.
My mom got stung<br/>by a jellyfish.
My mom makes<br/>the best scrambled eggs.
And... that's everything.
In fact, she should be here<br/>any minute.
Barney,
maybe she can cook you<br/>some real scrambled eggs
so you can see what<br/>you've been missing.
Don't do this, Robin.<br/>You can't win the egg war.
Canadian scrambled eggs,<br/>how quaint.
Does your mom put maple syrup<br/>on them?
Ha, ha, ha,<br/>this is all very friendly.
Get out of this now.
Why not? We put maple syrup<br/>on everything else.
Aw.
That's it!
We need your omelet station.
My son's fiancée is<br/>about to get served...
some delicious<br/>scrambled eggs.
Or I could go out to the<br/>driveway and eat some gravel.
Wait. Sorry.<br/>Did you say gravel or gavel?
Gravel. Why would<br/>I say gavel?
Gavel.
Thank you, Linus.
Curtis, can I please
have a map to the lighthouse?
It's a very romantic lighthouse.
I can't even have a map?
It's a very romantic map.
I can't let you go<br/>without a date.
Wait a minute.<br/>Wait a minute.
What happened to that girl Cassie?<br/>Cassie?
Cassie was the girl I'd spent
the entire previous night<br/>consoling.
Just consoling.
Yeah, that's not happening.
And then, in her anger,
Lily gave me a piece of advice
about which<br/>she would later say...
Oh, mama, that was<br/>some bad advice.
Okay, here's why<br/>you're an idiot.
Did you find<br/>Cassie attractive?
I guess. <br/>Is she a relatively normal height?
Yeah.<br/>So end up with her already.
God, do you really think
that you're gonna find<br/>some perfect girl
who checks off every<br/>item on your list?
Well, not every item.
I mean, she doesn't have<br/>to share my love for coins.
Although it would<br/>be nice, just once,
not to have to go stag<br/>to Coin-Con.
Pull your head out<br/>of your ass, Mosby.
Do you think Marshall<br/>always makes me happy?
I mean, sometimes being<br/>with him is a real trial.
Real trial.
Huh.
Did it to myself that time.
Look, Ted, it's<br/>time to settle.
Take this normal-sized chick<br/>up to the lighthouse
and fall in love with her
and quit bothering us with<br/>your dumb love life stuff.
God, I am so sick of being<br/>smarter than everyone else.
You're slipping, Linus.
We're running<br/>out of glasses.
Do you want to just go<br/>to the stupid lighthouse?
Ooh, zitch dog.
Cocker spaniel in the Jetta.
That's Marshall<br/>Eriksen-- 28,
Daphne-- zero.
For the 28th time,
I'm not playing<br/>your stupid game!
Oh, stupid, huh?
That's great.
I guess Daphne gets<br/>to pick the music
and crap all over<br/>my fun road-trip games.
You know, maybe<br/>Clint was right.
Maybe we do need<br/>conflict resolution.
I knew you guys<br/>would come around.
And so I made up my mind<br/>to settle for Cassie.
So, um, what kind<br/>of music do you like?
Hmm... nothing.
Still, I felt optimistic.
After all,<br/>Cassie was cute and single
and heck, it's not like<br/>the universe was telling us
we shouldn't be together.
Here we are. Enjoy.
happy wife,<br/>happy life.
Pretend<br/>they're just okay.
Please, Lily,<br/>I think I can manage to...
Oh, my God.
I'm eight years<br/>old again,
and life is perfect,
and I haven't peed my shorts<br/>in front of 350 Webelos
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals<br/>in Wheeling, West Virginia.
I'm sorry, Robin.
What do you think, Lily?
Oh, my God,<br/>they are so delicious.
Even more delicious than<br/>finding out Barney peed himself
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals<br/>in Wheeling, West Virginia.
I'm sorry, Robin.
Mmm.<br/>Come on,
they can't be<br/>that good.
Oh!
Excuse me, Mrs. Stinson,<br/>some of our guests
smelled your scrambled eggs<br/>and were wondering
if you could make some<br/>for them as well.
Oh, I don't think I should...
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!<br/>Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs!
Clint, what are<br/>you doing here?
What the Ohio State Board of<br/>Holistic Medicine has repeatedly
told me I'm in no way qualified<br/>to do: my job.
When I see a conflict<br/>needs resolving, I must act.
Plus, Ted's mom wanted me out<br/>of the house.
So, today, we're gonna build<br/>a new paradigm
of understanding,
and then you're gonna swoop me<br/>on back to Shaker Heights.
Oh, I need to stop
at Record Rev on Coventry.
My vaporizer's ready.
Marshall, pull over<br/>and dump this hippie
on the side of the road.
I can't do that.

Ow! Stupid racecar!
This is why children<br/>should not have toys!
Look, maybe this lighthouse<br/>thing isn't such a good idea.
No, you don't.
You committed,
and so did I, so let's go.
Oh. Ow! Oh!
Actually, it's feeling better.
Ow! Oh! No, it's not.
Oh.
Mom, I don't know<br/>why your phone is off.
Maybe you left your charger<br/>in the pickup truck.
But I need you to get here<br/>as fast possible.
I know<br/>you're probably gonna want
to take a hot bath<br/>when you get in.
She fits in a bathtub.
That's good news. Unless...
Oh, God, how big are<br/>Canadian bathtubs?
People ever line up
like this for your mom's eggs?
Loretta, even I could make<br/>better eggs than this.
Oh, I'd love it<br/>if you'd come teach me
how to make scrambled eggs.
It's a scramble-off,<br/>everybody!
A scramble-off<br/>to the death!
Someone go watch<br/>for the cops!
Maybe we should have read up<br/>on this town
before booking our wedding.
Let's do some,<br/>"When you... I feel."
All right, for example,
when you don't<br/>do trust falls,
I feel like you<br/>should do trust falls.
So just do the<br/>damn trust falls.
I'm driving a car, Clint.
Okay,
uh, Daphne, when you say<br/>"Drill, baby, drill"
every time<br/>that we pass a gas station,
I feel invalidated.
Marshall, when you talk,<br/>I feel shut up!
That's very good, both of you.
Really? Both of us?
Name one energy<br/>that's better than oil.
Wind, solar, hydroelectric.

of the way that your songs have<br/>a-a laxative effect on Marvin!
And on me. Every time<br/>Clint starts singing,
I just got to go.<br/>Yeah.
It's like, uh, the only<br/>trust fall when you sing
is that I "trust"<br/>that a piece of poop
is gonna "fall" out<br/>of my son's butt.
Hey, Clint, how about that?
You got us to agree on something.<br/>Yeah.
We both think you're a loser.
This therapy works.
No!
That is not the way<br/>therapy works at all!
Do you think this is<br/>some kind of a joke?!
This is my career!
I will not go back to<br/>coaching the Browns!
Why can't people take
what I do seriously?!
God!
Oh, my God. One more.
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God.
God, that was a lot of stairs.<br/>I'm exhausted.
My chest is on fire.
Oh.
Ooh! So, Mr. Arch-itect,
what do we do now?
Fall in love or something?
And, kids, as I stood<br/>on that lighthouse
and looked at that girl, I felt<br/>something happen inside me,
something that had only<br/>happened one other time
in my entire adult life.
Okay, scrambled eggs.
Here we go.
Where is the egg opener?
Never mind. I'll pre-scramble<br/>them. It's fine.
Okay, fine, Loretta.<br/>You know what? You win.
I don't<br/>know how
to cook egg.
If you don't even know how<br/>to make scrambled eggs,
I just worry what<br/>kind of breakfast
you're gonna be serving<br/>my grandchildren.
Well, lucky you
because that is one thing you<br/>won't ever have to worry about.
Mom, Robin<br/>can't have kids.
Every single job I take on,<br/>it's always the same!
"The coffee maker has to stay<br/>in the office, Clint!"
"You still have to wear pants<br/>on Casual Friday, Clint!"
"We didn't
hire you, Clint!"
Well, God,<br/>I'm-I'm...
I'm just sick of it. I'm si...
Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear<br/>my blood right now.
I'm having an attack.<br/>I'm having a blood attack.
A blood attack?
Yeah. Pull over. I need...<br/>I-I need to meditate.
I got to get my heart rate down.<br/>I'll... Ow! Pull over.
We're in the middle of nowhere.<br/>Pull over!
Zitch dog, Labradoodle<br/>in a Ford Fusion! Ow!
God...
Robin can't have kids?
But you always wanted children.
No, I always liked children.
I've always wanted a Lamborghini<br/>where there's a hot tub inside.
God, I wish that existed.
So no grandkids.
How long have you known<br/>about this?
I found out last fall.
Robin and I had been<br/>hanging out downtown
at this very cool secret bar.
What a lovely place!
Have you ever had<br/>sushi that fresh?
Okay, I am never getting<br/>on a mechanical bull again.
I can't believe Marshall<br/>and Lily missed out.
Promise me,<br/>if you ever have kids,
you'll sometimes get<br/>a babysitter
and come have an epic night.
Oh, and, P.S., bring the<br/>babysitter, she sounds dirty.
Actually, I, uh,<br/>I can't have kids,
so that's not an issue.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it weird<br/>that I'm hugging you like this?
No, it's not weird.
Now it's weird. Mm-hmm.<br/>Yep, the rain makes it weird.
Mom, I'm not marrying<br/>some future possibility
of starting a family.
I'm marrying a girl.
Who means more to me than kids.
Or my career.
Or even the Lambor-cuzzi,<br/>patent pending.
So please...
...be nice to her?
This is ridiculous.
Get out there<br/>and drag Clint's
downward-facing ass back in here<br/>so we can get going.
Just let him do his thing.
Do you know why<br/>the Daphnes of the world
always get to pick the music
and the Marshalls pay<br/>all the tolls?
Because<br/>the Marshalls
are so concerned

Are you completely blind?

- Robin has changed her mind.<br/>- No, Robin doesn't change her mind.
Except that she does. Remember she used<br/>to claim to hate white-guy funk bands?
Yet, at the farewell performance of my band...
...The Funk, the Whole Funk<br/>and Nothing but the Funk, there's Robin...
...nodding her head and shouting out<br/>requests for "Give Up the Funk."
I think she was nodding in response<br/>to my question, "Do you want to leave soon?"
And she was legitimately suggesting<br/>that you give up the funk.
Can we just drop this?<br/>I have moved on.
Except that you haven't.
You didn't just come up with the<br/>French horn thing. You've thought about this.
Mr. Sparks, I loved The Notebook.
Eddie, you're down by 80!<br/>Will you watch the game?
Do not come any closer.<br/>I swear I will kill you.
It's cool.<br/>I'm not gonna come any closer.
You're looking at the door,<br/>waiting for someone. Someone important.
Someone who will fill<br/>an empty space in your life.

Uh-huh.
But which one?
Clooney? DiCaprio?
Zabka?
No, I'm gonna go with Ryan...

Come on! What ever happened<br/>to the guy who wasn't afraid...
...to charge headlong into the unknown?<br/>- What unknown?
Sure, eight years ago, when I stole<br/>that French horn, yeah, that was the unknown.
But now?<br/>How many times have we been here?
I know exactly what's gonna happen.
You know who else knew exactly<br/>what was gonna happen?
The Washington Generals<br/>on January 5th, 1971.
They knew they were gonna lose.<br/>They went and gave it their best shot.
And they won that game, Ted,<br/>for one reason and for one reason only.
Scoring error and the fact<br/>that Curly Neal had the flu?
Perseverance.<br/>It was the only win in Generals history.
But that's all you need.
Just one win.

For free. So if you wouldn't mind<br/>just writing your number down...
...on this sign-up sheet...
Listen.
I appreciate that you feel<br/>like you need my number.
Um, maybe it's because<br/>you're really sad about something...
...and this is your way of feeling better<br/>about yourself.
But since I have a boyfriend...
...and I'm pretty sure I heard you call me<br/>a target earlier over there...
...I'm gonna go ahead<br/>and not give you my number.
I'm gonna give you something even better.
Wow. Right to the chase.<br/>Meet you in Aisle 6.
I'm gonna give you this.
It's gonna be okay.
You're a good guy.
You will get through this.

Excuse me.
What do you mean, "sad"?
Ted, I'm calling you from Chicago, Illinois...
...where I'm a key player<br/>in a very successful architectural firm.
- Oh, yeah, I read about that.<br/>- About what you read...
- You built that concave glass tower.<br/>- It melted a few buildings across the street.
Yes, fine. But come on, what architect hasn't<br/>made a major design flaw...
...that raised the temperature<br/>of the city aquarium to 190 degrees...
...and killed thousands of very rare fish?<br/>That's the past, Ted.
I'm looking forward.
I want you on my team,<br/>and I won't take no for an answer.
- No.<br/>- I don't think you heard me, Ted.
- No.<br/>- Come on, Ted.
Please? They're gonna give me<br/>a parking spot if you say yes.
- Do I get a parking spot?<br/>- We can go tandem.
- No.<br/>- Every other week, then?
- No.<br/>- Chicago's more of a walking town.
- No.<br/>- All right, you can have the parking spot.
- So that's a yes?<br/>- No.
Look, Ted, I can make your life very difficult.
- How?<br/>- "How?"
I will call you a lot.
I will Tweet at you like crazy.
- I will live on your Facebook wall.<br/>- We're not Facebook friends.
Yeah, what's going on with that?<br/>It's been pending, like, for eight months now.
Look, Ted, you're a very hot commodity.
Everybody loves the GNB tower...
...and how it hasn't blinded any pilots<br/>on final approach into O'Hare. Ha-ha-ha.
And I may have told the partners here<br/>that you and I are very good friends.
- So please, just say you'll think about it.<br/>- Fine.
I'll think about it.
Druthers shoots, he scores!
"Sad"? Lady, I got 14 girls' numbers<br/>in the last hour.
And this was an off night. Heh-heh.<br/>What can I possibly be sad about?
I think you were in love<br/>and you messed it up.
Every moment since has been spent trying<br/>to stay busy enough to ignore that fact.
TED:<br/>And that's how Barney met your mother.
- Well, the Generals lost.<br/>- What a nail-biter.
The fourth quarter,<br/>my heart was in my throat.
- What was the final?<br/>- Two hundred sixteen to 12.
Nobody talk to me right now.<br/>I can't even...
The strangest thing happened.<br/>I got a call from an unknown number.
And when I answered, l...
- You're eating olives.<br/>- Yup.
Do you want these? I hate olives.
I thought you hate olives.
Heh. I guess I changed my mind.
[PHONE RINGS]
Ah.
Hello, partner.
Boy, that just sounds right, doesn't it?
Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers,<br/>my answer is no.
What? No. Ted, come on.
I'm sorry. I still have things<br/>to do here in New York.
I am going to build a tower of glass<br/>and melt you with it.
- No, you won't.<br/>- No, I won't. But know this.
After today, this offer is gone forever.
When I hang up this phone,<br/>you and I are done.
- The door is closed.<br/>- Okay.
The door's always open, Ted. If you change<br/>your mind, just call me back, okay? Bye.
I think he's coming around.
We tried dating a while back,<br/>and it was a disaster.
But I always regret giving up.
It just ended so quickly.

I don't know.

Are you gonna go get this girl or what?
I don't know.<br/>I'm kind of at my peak right now.

Clumsy hands much, Barney?
Just disrobe and send<br/>up those wet clothes.
You'll be cold, so I'll send<br/>down strawberry warming gel
and some cozy, zippered masks.
Ooh.
My calligraphy ink!
I mean, the Gretzky photo!
Some bastard snuck into my room
and spilled ink all over the Gretzky<br/>photo I was holding for Barney.
Detective Mosby is on the case.
- Oh, God, that's horrible.<br/>- I know. It was a gift for Robin.
No, I mean, "Oh, God, that's horrible.<br/>Detective Mosby's the worst."
Mm, Detective Mosby is the case-crackingest<br/>private dick on the scene.
Really? Like that case from eight<br/>years ago you still haven't cracked?
I'm callin' it.
Damn it!
My greatest failure.
I will solve this case.
Now, there were three people nearby<br/>when Barney gave me that head shot:
Karate Kid bad boy Billy Zabka,
a shifty-eyed bellhop,
and Robin's cousin Claude from<br/>Quebec with the neck trouble.
Right, 'cause an elaborate<br/>conspiracy is much more likely
than you leaving the photo<br/>next to an open ink bottle.
- Thank you!<br/>- You can't even detect sarcasm!
Why don't you just try to fix the photo?<br/>Don't you have ink remover?
Of course I have ink remover.<br/>I'm not one of those sloppy,
punk calligraphers who's in<br/>it for glory over craft.
No, we got to solve this!
Now, the question is,
which of those three suspects<br/>had the most cause to frame me?
The one that I replaced<br/>as Barney's best man?
I'm coming for you, Mosby.
Billy Zabka!
Okay, real quick, I need<br/>fresh-cut English lavender,
a copy of Shakespeare's<br/>18th sonnet,
and enough Nutella to cover<br/>a 60-year-old woman.
Oh, great. You guys escaped.
Got rescued!
- Are you okay?<br/>- A bit shaken up.
Being trapped in an<br/>elevator is scary.
No, Barney lowered in a TV showing<br/>some pretty graphic 1970s pornography.
Still, a lot of familiar faces in there.<br/>Well, not just faces.
I'm gonna go find my wife.
Nice job, bro.
Mom was just about to get some action for<br/>the first time since she conceived me.
Barney, this has to stop.<br/>You're being delusional.
Mom is not getting back<br/>together with Jerry.
Because she's getting back<br/>together with my daddy!
I see what you're doing.
You didn't bring your<br/>dad here to marry us.
You want him to get back<br/>together with Mom!
Which is completely<br/>insane, by the way.
Um, my dad's single,<br/>Mom's single.
Your dad's happily married with two kids.<br/>Which one makes more sense?
I agree. It's a tie.
What do we do?
You back down and let me get<br/>my mom and dad back together?
Um, how about you back down and let<br/>me get my mom and dad back together?
I can already picture it.

Where the heck is this<br/>parasailing place?
You know what? I'm gonna...<br/>I'm gonna call Jerry.
Oh, that's weird. I just<br/>lost cell reception.
Yes.
Weird.
Lot of pretty paintings<br/>in this hotel.
I like how they've been...<br/>framed.
I've noticed the vintage, antique,<br/>gilded Victorian frames, too.
I'm not blind... but<br/>what are you getting at?
You know damn well<br/>what I'm getting at!
You're jealous I got the<br/>Best Mansmanship back,
so you destroyed that photo as<br/>part of some diabolical scheme
to make me look bad.
I bet you even found some<br/>other photo of Wayne Gretzky
so you could swoop in<br/>and save the day.
- You're insane.<br/>- Am I?
- Yeah. Yeah.<br/>- Am I?
Where were you today<br/>at 3:15 p.m.?
Right here getting a massage.
Rocked a 60-minute deep tish.
Now if you'll excuse<br/>me, Detective,
I think I'll go have<br/>some pineapple.
- How do you know about that?<br/>- Everybody knows about that!
- Excuse me?<br/>- Mm?
You destroyed that<br/>photo, didn't you?
- No, I didn't.<br/>- Admit it!
I complained about you to the bell<br/>captain, so you got your revenge.
You complained about me?
No.
So, Claude...
I see that you're a<br/>Montreal Canadiens fan.
Which means you hate<br/>the Edmonton Oilers,
which is why you destroyed<br/>the Wayne Gretzky head shot!
J'accuse!
C'est ridicule!
If it's so ridicule,
how do you explain this?
Ah, seems like<br/>I've caught you...
midnight blue-handed.
- Oh, these.<br/>- Yeah.
I-I was out by the water when...
an elderly R-Rastafarian<br/>hang glider...
he-he crash<br/>onto a beached squid,
which squirted ink<br/>when I ran in to help.
You really expect<br/>me to believe that?
Story checks out.
Sorry, Claude.
De rien.
I don't get it.
We were bonding.
I can't think of<br/>anything I did wrong!
Okay, I did a few things wrong.
For the last time, I did not leave the<br/>bag of oranges you bought on the roof!
No more breaking<br/>the speed limit.
And, uh, thanks for flagging me down<br/>and telling me she was going 67.
Just following the<br/>rules, Officer.
Oh. She's also not<br/>wearing her seat belt.
You are not allowed<br/>to use that word!
Only we're allowed<br/>to use that word!
I am so sorry.
I will never call you<br/>or anyone else a...
Trekkie again.
But I apologized<br/>and you accepted.
I even bought you more oranges.
Look, it wasn't you, okay?
Baby, I know your speech<br/>at the Model U.N. is a big deal,
but I'm just not sure<br/>I'll make it in time.
I'm trying.
You know what?
Don't bother coming.
So, back at the airport, that story<br/>was true? You have a daughter?
She lives with her dad.
And since I travel for work,<br/>I miss a lot of stuff.
I only work as hard as I<br/>do to provide for her.
But kids, they don't<br/>understand logic.
Kids understand who shows up.
That's why her dad's her hero...
and I get hung up on.
Go see your daughter's speech. If<br/>you show up, all will be forgiven.
Just drop it.
And drop me at home.
Then head out to your wedding.
End of discussion.
Barney, even if<br/>your plan worked,
you'd be destroying<br/>your dad's marriage.
- Okay, you may have a point.<br/>- Can I suggest something?
Truce?
We both agree to drop this.
Agreed.
- Hey, I got a replacement bottle<br/>of 30-year Glen McKenna. - Okay.
Look, even if Mom never<br/>gets back together
with either one of our dads,<br/>we're still brothers.
It's not a competition.
I win!
Hoo-hoo!
Get your damn hands off my mom!
- Get your damn hands on my mom!<br/>- One on, one off?
What the hell is going on here?
After you boys tracked Sam<br/>down a few years back,
we got in touch. We became friends<br/>again, started hanging out.
And then one day, she went<br/>from being Loretta to being...
Lo-ret-ta.
We wanted to wait to tell<br/>you because it's still new,
but it was inevitable you'd find out<br/>once Sam came to perform the ceremony.
Is that what you two call it?
"Performing the ceremony"?
Oh, Sam's marrying<br/>you tomorrow, dear.
Right. Thank you, Reverend.
Look, is there any way you guys<br/>can be all right with this?
Of course I am!
Barney?
I know I've been acting<br/>crazy today, but...
I just have one real question,<br/>Mom, and I want an honest answer.
Is there a scenario--<br/>and hear me out--
where you might consider doing kind of a<br/>three-way deal with both of our dads?
- God! What is wrong with you?!<br/>- Oh, dude, come on!
That's what I thought!
It's time to admit it, Ted.
You spilled the ink.<br/>There's no conspiracy.
I guess you're right.
I mean, the only other person who<br/>saw Barney give me that photo...
was you.
Hey. Idiot.
While you've been playing detective,<br/>I've been cleaning up your mess.
Look, the ink remover works.
I'm gonna finish this.
You come clean to Barney.
Okay.
She's been missing all day,
a-and I found what appears to<br/>be a-a suicide note on my bed.
But it doesn't really<br/>sound like her.
"I'm going to kill my--<br/>wait for it-- self."
Is everything okay<br/>with Mr. Zabka?
Wait. W-Wait. Why do you<br/>think that's Billy Zabka?
See? The man from the<br/>lobby got this massage.
A younger gentleman bought<br/>it for him as a gift.
He even signed his name for him.<br/>Right here.
I'm telling all y'all...
it's Zabka-tage.

- Wait, this isn't...<br/>- It's your daughter's school.
- You need to go in.<br/>- She asked me not to come, Marshall.
This doesn't make any sense.
Kids don't understand logic.
Kids understand who shows up.
People say children<br/>are the future.
I say...
oil is the future!
Don't listen to these gutless<br/>environmental sissies!

You said it was nuts to think that my<br/>mom and dad would get back together.
But that's what happened for James. I've<br/>been dreaming of that since I was five.
Well, that and my own<br/>operational Death Star.
But mostly them getting<br/>back together.
Why does James get<br/>it and I don't?
Well, think about it.
You have me, your<br/>dad has Cheryl...
"So to summarize:
"I'm super dead, you should<br/>totally bone Loretta,
"and I never loved you, Cheryl,"
which is misspelled.
...but James is going through a divorce.<br/>He just lost his family.
I-I know you've been<br/>dreaming of this, but...
maybe he needs "Mom and<br/>Dad" more than you.
So, Billy, did you really think<br/>you could get away with it?
- Actually, I did.<br/>- Ah.
I was gonna give this to Barney
and say I'd driven an hour away to get a<br/>replacement from an autograph dealer.
First, I needed an alibi.
So I got Barney's dad a massage
but signed in my name.
Then I switched the Gretzky<br/>head shot with one of myself.
I always travel with 2,000 of those<br/>handsome devils in the trunk of my car.
I have so many questions<br/>for you, but first...
you keep 2,000 head shots<br/>of yourself in your trunk?
No one ever wants them! They only<br/>want the "good guy's" autograph!
In the '80s, I was the<br/>bad guy in every movie.
Do you know what my life<br/>has been like?
Every premiere, when<br/>I came on-screen...
I wasn't a bad guy in real<br/>life, just a kick-ass actor.
No one got that.
It happened everywhere I went.
Somehow, people<br/>always had popcorn.
25 years of getting<br/>crane-kicked in the nuts,
until Barney Stinson gave me<br/>the best moment of my life.
Hey. Hey, some issues just<br/>came up with Ted, so...
will you be my best man?
- Sure.<br/>- Thanks.
- Hello?<br/>- Mom?
No, no, listen, listen.
I just became<br/>somebody's best man.
You can come to<br/>Thanksgiving this year!
To Barney Stinson,<br/>I wasn't a bad guy.
To Barney Stinson,
I was the best man.
I thought if Ted screwed up<br/>again, I'd have another shot.
But I guess this time I<br/>really was the bad guy.
Hey, Ted, what's so urgent?
I have something to tell you.
I destroyed that Gretzky head<br/>shot and I couldn't fix it.
Billy saved the day by getting a new<br/>one from an autograph dealer nearby.
- A-An hour away.<br/>- An hour away. Just be cool.
Awesome. Thanks, Billy!
Ah.
And, Ted...
I really appreciate that<br/>you told the truth.
Ow...<br/>Psych!
Billy rules, Ted<br/>drools, Stinson out.
You're all right, Mosby.
And for an all too rare<br/>moment that weekend,
everything was all right.

[<div class="full-script">Marshall and Marvin<br/>were taking the bus
on their way to Long<br/>Island to meet up with us.
There, there, little Marvin.<br/>Let no more tears fall.
We're gonna see Mommy<br/>in no time at all.
Hello there. I'm sorry<br/>for all of the noise.
It's been a long day<br/>for the Eriksen boys.
- Uh... what's with the rhyming?<br/>- I'm glad that you ask.
To get my son sleeping<br/>is no easy task.
A few weeks ago, the<br/>job fell to my wife.
And as the poor baby<br/>cried out for dear life,
she read every book,<br/>but all were no use
until she arrived at a<br/>mother named Goose.
- Why, Marvin...<br/>- She noted.
...these rhymes make you tired!
And ever since then, all<br/>young Marvin's required
is one book of rhymes, and<br/>to dream land he goes.
Now, what shall we read?
Oh, crap, I left<br/>his book in the car!
That blows.
♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x11♪<br/>Bedtime Stories<br/>Original Air Date on November 25, 2013
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<br/>@elder_man<br/>Resync for WEB-DL by Norther
Oh, no, what a bummer!<br/>What craptastic luck!
Without Marvin's rhyme book,<br/>this ride's gonna suck!
Does anyone here have<br/>some poetry maybe?
- Or any advice?<br/>- Yeah! Don't have a baby!
I guess if I don't want<br/>young Marvin to wake up,
the rhymes will just have<br/>to be ones that I make up.
I'll whip up some<br/>poetry in seconds flat!
Oh, I know! This story's<br/>called Mosby at the Bat!
The outlook wasn't brilliant<br/>for poor Ted's romantic life.
He was deep into his thirties,<br/>and yet, still he had no wife.
But then, one day whilst grading<br/>papers, life sent him a whammy.
A physics prof named Lisa who'd<br/>just moved here from Miami.
- Professor?<br/>- She asked timidly. He answered:
- Call me Ted.<br/>- Oh. I don't want to bother you.
- Please, have a seat.<br/>- He said.
I'm fairly new to teaching,<br/>and I'm looking for advice.
Every night I practice giving<br/>lectures, sometimes twice.
But when I teach magnetic force,<br/>I just see eyeballs glazing.
I asked around, and people say<br/>your lectures are amazing.
Which is really saying something,<br/>because, architecture? Yawn.
And Ted thought...
Psh, yeah, 'cause physics<br/>is so interesting.
Go on.
It's just that you're so skilled,<br/>and I'm a relative beginner.
If it isn't too much trouble,<br/>can I take you out to dinner?
I'd love to get some pointers,<br/>and I shouldn't keep you late.
- What do you say?<br/>- What do I say?
Teddy Westside's got a date!
- Hooray!<br/>- We cheered.
- Ted's off the bench!<br/>- Our boy's back in the game!
Thank God, it's been a hundred<br/>years since Mosby scored a dame.
The last time he saw boobies was<br/>the screen-test scene in Fame.
The last girl he dated, I<br/>think "Righty" was her name.
Hold it. Let's not all go crazy<br/>like some wild berzerkers.
What if this is just a business<br/>meal between co-workers?
Ted thought back on<br/>past failed dates.
Oh, God, that could be true.
How many times have I come<br/>home to find my balls are blue?
It all depends where Ted and<br/>his new fetching young Floridian
are standing in relation<br/>to that puzzling meridian
called "The International Date<br/>Line." That's right, new theory.
- "What's that," you ask?<br/>- Nobody did.
I'll now address your query!
The date line is the border<br/>betwixt happiness and sorrow.
On this side,<br/>you go home tonight.
On this side, home tomorrow.
And then, as Barney made some<br/>gestures that were rather rude,
Ted left to go meet Lisa,<br/>in a rather puzzled mood.
Was this a date? He simply<br/>couldn't tell how he was faring.
Then Lisa showed up. Ted rejoiced<br/>to see what she was wearing.
For girls at business dinners don't<br/>have necklines that revealing!
But then a friendly handshake<br/>gave poor Ted a sinking feeling.
And so, the night wore on. And<br/>back and forth, the globe rotated.
But still, Ted's curiosity<br/>was never fully sated.
How long could this continue?<br/>He was truly fortune's pawn.
Then Lisa saw the TV.
Hey, the Yankees game is on!
- Of baseball...<br/>- Ted observed...
...you seem to have some<br/>firsthand knowledge.
To which the lady<br/>shrugged and said...
I played softball in college.
Now the age-old softball stereotype's<br/>just that, and nothing more.
- Yeah!<br/>- But as the Yankees got a run,
Ted feared he wouldn't score.
For while the date side of the line's<br/>the one we all might guess he's in,
there'll be no joy in<br/>Tedville if our Lisa is a...
Yes! We win!
Then Lisa took a<br/>drink and said...
This may sound kind of random,
but there actually is a reason<br/>for my rabid Yankee fandom.
I guess I'll just be honest<br/>here, though crazy it may seem.
My first week in New York,<br/>I dated someone on the team.
- Which player?<br/>- I'm not saying.
- Please?<br/>- What are you, a reporter?
Ted's mind began to race. The<br/>waiter came to take their order.
- As Lisa said...<br/>- I might like the spaghetti marinara.
Poor Ted just<br/>wondered silently...
- Mariano Rivera?<br/>- And as she said...
I read this place has<br/>great chicken Milano.
All Ted could bring<br/>himself to think was:
Alfonso Soriano?
I want something hearty.
How about blackened miso cod?
Is it Joe Girardi?<br/>Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!
Okay, Ted, calm down.
You've got to get<br/>yourself together.
Just smile, be charming, ooze<br/>charisma, talk about the weather.
For this might be a date,
which means there<br/>might be hanky-panky.
So, dude, be cool,<br/>relax, don't even...
Just tell me which Yankee!
I'd rather not<br/>discuss this here.
But then again, I'd hate...
to let a silly secret<br/>ruin such a lovely date.
If there's an elephant in the room,<br/>why don't we just remove it?
I dated Derek Jeter. Here's<br/>a picture that'll prove it.
As Ted looked at<br/>that cell phone pic,
there were two things he reckoned.<br/>This definitely was a date,
but there wouldn't be a second.
See? It worked. I said some<br/>rhymes, and out my boy did conk.
Now let's enjoy the ride.
Move, jackass!
Okay, I need a brand-new tale<br/>to silence Marvin's chatter.
I don't know, that last one had<br/>some sketchy subject matter.
Forgive me, but before you got<br/>here, did you smoke a joint?
You don't tell kids<br/>a tale that crass!
I guess he had a point.
I know, I said some things that were,<br/>as you say, kind of questionable.
The truth is, children Marvin's age<br/>aren't really that impressionable.
Do you remember anything<br/>from when you were this small?
Pumpkin picking at age three is<br/>the first thing I recall.
- Hmm.<br/>- Huh.
He won't remember this.<br/>I guess it's true.
It better be.
Or else we'll end up paying through<br/>the nose for Marvin's therapy.
Okay, buddy, nice chat,<br/>but I think I need a break.
Great idea.
After this story!<br/>Robin Takes the Cake.
Once in an East Side bakery,
your debonair Aunt Robin was<br/>making other customers think,
"Geez, who let this slob in?"
She didn't care about their<br/>stares, or who was looking on.
She'd just broke up with...
Kevin.
No, Gael. Or Scooby?
Don?
Now, sometimes, when it rains it pours,<br/>and sometimes, it starts snowing,
for as cream filling<br/>hit her shirt...
Hey, Robin, how's it going?
'Twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend<br/>from her younger days in Canada,
but now, he looked<br/>quite different...
Um...
Rhyme. Uh... thinking. Uh...
I've just been<br/>handed a news flash.
The word "Canada"<br/>is unrhymeable.
It's easier to-- I don't know-- get<br/>drunk and try to climb a bull.
But Canada, damn it, ask any man on the<br/>planet and watch their stammerin' stamina
as they clamor and cram it into the middle<br/>of a sentence for a shot at repentance,
pass the problem on to all<br/>their non-rhyming descendants.
I've never met anyone who<br/>could clean up after Canada.
Except my Uncle Tony from the Bronx.<br/>He's a janitor.
Show-off.
Simon. Nice to see you.
So, what brings you to New York?
- I live here now.<br/>- What? Really?
- Yeah.<br/>- That's great.
Can I get a fork?
He'd always been a deadbeat<br/>and your classic hoser phony,
but seeing Simon all cleaned<br/>up hit Robin like a Zamboni.
And as she looked him up and<br/>down, young Robin felt a tingle.
Had Simon blossomed finally?<br/>And if so, was he single?
So great.
She purred, whilst batting<br/>her eyelashes like a flooze.
Yup, I'm engaged to Louise Marsh,<br/>and our pad's got a Jacuzz!
The bakery spinned, the<br/>floor dropped out.
The air was thick as syrup.
Poor Robin swooned, she couldn't<br/>breathe, her eyes began to tear up.
And as she tried to stammer some<br/>excuse to get away, Simon said:
Our wedding cake is<br/>pretty bitchin', eh?
And so was born the worst<br/>idea poor Robin's ever had.
And on Ted's door<br/>there came a rapping.
I did something bad.
As Robin told her tale, Ted knew<br/>she'd made a massive boo-boo.
For stealing someone's wedding<br/>cake is terribly bad juju.
Robin, I'm beside myself<br/>to see what you've become!
You must return<br/>this cake at once!
- I can't!<br/>- Why not?
'Cause...
Yum.
Ted gasped, for he had never<br/>seen a brazen act so vicious.
Robin felt remorse, and yet...
Oh, God, this is delicious!
So one piece led to two, then<br/>three, then five, then 17.
She savaged that poor cake<br/>like some rapacious wolverine.
Eating, gobbling, munching, so<br/>the frenzied night wore on.
And by the time your mom arrived,<br/>the cake was halfway gone.
I came as soon as I got word.
So how bad is the damage?
See for yourself the product<br/>of her cake-in-gullet crammage!
Half a cake?
What have I done?! The world<br/>shall not forgive it!
This day will live in infamy.<br/>I never shall outlive it!
For I have become the girl that eats<br/>her feelings, don't mistake it.
I think I need to get out<br/>of this chair before I break it.
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!
Said Mommy, with great fervor.
You can't stop now,<br/>for don't you see?
To the uninformed observer,<br/>you're not some sad cliché,
some loser from a<br/>chick-lit story.
You're Robin, and you're half<br/>a wedding cake away from glory!
If you quit now, then Simon<br/>wins, the tale comes to a stop
at how you saw an ex, freaked<br/>out, and robbed a pastry shop.
But if you have the<br/>guts, my dear,
it's time to get empowered<br/>and be remembered for this
sweet behemoth you devoured.
And years from now,
the troubadour will raise his voice and<br/>sing of the time that Robin took the cake.
And ate the whole...
damned...
thing.
Once more into the<br/>breach she surged,
as Ted and Mommy cheered and bite by bite<br/>the towering confection disappeared.
Some friends were called to come and watch.<br/>And no one had to beg.
It soon became a party.
Barney even got a keg.
Forkful after forkful, Robin<br/>guzzled French vanilla
making noises not unlike<br/>those made by a gorilla.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!<br/>- Come on, Robin, finish it.
- Yeah.<br/>- Mom's exhortations rang
like Apollo coaching Rocky<br/>'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.
- Oh, Rocky IV, my favorite.<br/>- No, no, IV is with the Russians.
No, IV's the one where he talks<br/>weird because of his concussions.
I think that's all of them.
- Hey now, no need to be discordant.<br/>- It's Rocky IV.
- No, III.<br/>- No, II.
It's really not important.
At last young Robin raised the final bite<br/>up to her lips the crowd grew still.
The only sound was<br/>Barney eating chips.
Just one bite left.
Hey, this is like that scene<br/>from Cool Hand Luke. You know,
"My boy can eat 50 eggs " Right?
She's gonna puke.
But Robin did not puke. She ate<br/>that bite and stood up, proud.
Wait. I'm not done yet.
She shouted, to the<br/>startled crowd.
I've bested this<br/>here wedding cake.
I'll gladly wear that crown.
But now that I have done that<br/>task it's time to wash it down.
For it's been such an awesome night,<br/>there's just one way to cap it.
I'm going to drink<br/>this entire keg.
Okay, Barney, tap it.
- Oh!<br/>- Wow.
- Hup.<br/>- Ho-o, oh.
And now that night's remembered<br/>not for Robin getting dumped
but as the night we took her<br/>in to get her stomach pumped.
And look at that, the little<br/>angel's sleeping soundly, Gus.
- Looks like our problems...<br/>- Pick a lane!
I hate this stupid bus.
Marvin, I'm afraid this night<br/>is not much of a winner.
Stuck in traffic, now we've missed<br/>the whole rehearsal dinner.
I pray that I was right and<br/>that you'll have no memory
of this godforsaken ride<br/>down the congested LIE.
At least we know one thing for sure:<br/>things can't get worse, I swear.
Adios, truck stop<br/>burrito. Ooh!
Do not go in there.
Okay, one more story,<br/>and I'll try to tell it pretty.
The tale of Barney Stinson,<br/>Player King of New York City.
Once upon a time, we all went<br/>out to get our drink on.
When who should walk in but a girl<br/>with sweater tight and pink on.
She ordered up a beer. I think<br/>you see where this is going.
As Barney put it,<br/>oh so eloquently:
Boy-oy-oy-oing.
He rose to go approach this<br/>girl commanding such intrigue
when Mommy interrupted:
Dude, she's way out<br/>of your league.
She's not in Daisy Dukes, nor<br/>squeezed into a Hooters tee.
And I don't see a Curves<br/>membership dangling from her key.
She has no glaring spray<br/>tan, no unicorn tattoos.
She's sipping Chardonnay, not<br/>pounding cherry-flavored booze.
Her makeup isn't running, she's<br/>not playing with her hair.
There's very little chance<br/>she'll let you put it anywhere.
Your challenge is accepted, Lil.
There is no girl too pretty,<br/>for I am Barney Stinson,
Player King of New York City.
You can't anoint yourself the king,<br/>just like that jerk, LeBron.
He left the Cavs<br/>three years ago.
Bro, give it up, move on.
So why am I king?<br/>Glad you asked.
- We didn't.<br/>- Never do.
It's origin story time.
And trust me, every<br/>word is true.
One morning long ago, I<br/>woke up next to a conquest.
So many great things 'bout this girl:<br/>her boobs, her rack, her chest.
She had a thirst for action, and<br/>young Barney was a-quenchin' it.
- Is this important to the story?<br/>- No, just thought I'd mention it.
As I departed, having bid<br/>this busty babe buh-bye,
I stopped and looked<br/>around, and wondered:
Where the hell am I?
The sign read 22nd Street,<br/>and my concern decreased
until a cold wind blew a branch<br/>aside, revealing: "East."
The East Side. No.
Wh-What have I done?
I stammered with chagrin.
Just then a black<br/>sedan pulled up...
- You Barney?<br/>- Yeah.
Get in.
Is any of this true?
Of course. Now, hang<br/>on to your "chayers."
For that day I was<br/>called before...
the High Council of Players.
Gentlemen, for your attendance<br/>here, our deepest thanks.
I'm sad to say, this council<br/>has a poacher in its ranks.
For Barney here picked up a<br/>girl outside his territory.
The East Side is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.<br/>He's mad.
True story.
The Agreement of 2004<br/>quite clearly did define
Fifth Avenue to be our hunting<br/>grounds' dividing line.
Your West Side college girls are<br/>not the slip I park my boat in.
So you should know my East Side<br/>debutantes are quite verboten.
Members of the council...
Bros... nobody wants a war.
Of course I've not forgotten<br/>the agreement of '04.
What can I say? A bonehead move.
Defend it? I'm not able.
But, bros, have I not been a<br/>bro to each bro at this table?
My friend from Brooklyn, Pickle Jar<br/>Bob, will give some validation.
Remember that young tourist who<br/>was looking for Penn Station?
She'd just come in from Boston,<br/>had a wicked good-in-bed look.
I gave her bad directions and<br/>she ended up in Red Hook.
- Shut up, Barney.<br/>- Whoa, Bronx Donnie,
let's not get excited.
Tuxedo Charlie's not the only<br/>one here who's been slighted.
You told her you were Jeter<br/>in your quest to lie upon her.
Impersonating Yankees is my thing.<br/>Have you no honor?
Gentlemen, please, let's not blow<br/>this détente to smithereens.
Council recognizes Captain<br/>Bill, our bro from Queens.
Thank you.
You all know me, and you<br/>all respect my game.
I dress up like a pilot and<br/>meet girls in baggage claim.
And on my long-ass subway ride<br/>from 61st and Woodside,
I came up with a plan to keep you<br/>each other's good side.
Barney, you have<br/>wronged these two.
So, for the game they're losing,<br/>you now must grant them each
a West Side hottie<br/>of their choosing.
You're kidding. That's<br/>the settlement?
- Come on, that's rather silly.<br/>- Gentlemen, what say you?
- I want Robin.<br/>- I want Lily.
Please. Bronx Donnie? No chance<br/>he could get me in the sack.
Tell that Mafioso I know<br/>something he can whack.
Ladies, don't you worry, your<br/>fair legs can all stay closed.
'Cause luckily they took the<br/>counteroffer I proposed.
Well, gentlemen, it seems there's<br/>nothing I can say to sway you.
Charlie, Donnie, say no more,<br/>I gladly will repay you.
Carlotta, some champagne.
Let's toast before<br/>we all adjourn.
To boobies.
Oh, and B-T-dub, y'all<br/>just drank poison.
Ha-burn.
And thus, my friends, I have become,<br/>through methods somewhat gory
the Player King of New York City.<br/>Boom.
The end.
True story.
Well, that was great. Your little<br/>story tickled all our ribs.
But one mistake you made, sir,<br/>was forgetting to call dibs.
No! Not fair.
But I'm the king.
- And such a better dresser.<br/>- Sorry, dude,
but that's revenge for<br/>Lisa the professor.
Let's have another round.
- Yes.<br/>- Your mommy said.
And so we had one.
The night wore on,<br/>and I must say,
it wasn't a half bad one.
What memories. Our young and<br/>happy hearts were hot as fire.
Feels like a lifetime<br/>since those days.
Sorry, folks, flat tire.
Oh, come on. Now I'm never<br/>gonna make it to Nantucket.
Oh, look a fireworks display.<br/>Some rockets red glare action.
Thank God.
Thought my glaucoma drops<br/>were causing a reaction.
Marvin, I'm so sorry this whole<br/>journey's been a bummer.
Soon you'll be right back in<br/>Mommy's arms, as warm as summer.
But sadly while your troubles<br/>stop once we get to the inn
the moment we arrive is when<br/>my troubles will begin.
Sometimes daddies screw up,
sometimes mommies get upset.
I really hope this weekend<br/>is a memory you'll forget.
So look up at those fireworks,<br/>enjoy the falling embers...
And that, kids, is the very first<br/>thing your cousin Marvin remembers.
Gentlemen and ladies,<br/>it'll be an hour or so...
before the truck gets here to<br/>give our broken bus a tow.
So in the meantime I suggest<br/>we all get nice and cozy.
We're gonna be here for a while.
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?
Yeah!
How far do you suppose it is<br/>to the Farhampton Inn?
I'd say about five miles away.
Oh, no.
What's with the grin?
Then Marshall looked<br/>up heavenward,
and swore by night's first star<br/>five simple words he'd soon regret:
I can walk that far.

[<div class="full-script">Barney:<br/>"let's get this party started."
Hey, can you<br/>push the button?
Do not touch<br/>that button.
Just give it a little push.<br/>Don't push it.
Half of it, halfway, halfway...<br/>Don't even touch it.
Why can't I<br/>push the button?
Because whenever barney<br/>sees a button-- any button--
He has to push it.
(panting)
Sorry.
Why are you so mad?
Because my rehearsal dinner
Was supposed to start<br/>ten minutes ago.
But instead of stuffing my face
With hors d'oeuvres
That I have been dreaming<br/>about for months,
I am in a laser tag
Security office,
Waiting for the police<br/>to arrest my fiancé
For causing a disturbance.
Hey, you said "fiancé."
That's a good sign.<br/>(sighs)
Now what do you say<br/>we give that old button a push?
Take a good look at<br/>this face, barney, okay?
'cause it'll be useful<br/>for the future.
This is my "pretty mad" face.
Well, then, we've got a problem.
'cause it looks a lot like<br/>your "pretty hungry" face.
I'm missing<br/>the bacon-wrapped figs!
Please push the button!
Why is it<br/>so cold in here?
You trying to get me to talk<br/>or something?
Not really.
In fact, if you could just<br/>sit there quietly...
Fine, I'll talk.
It all started a few months ago,
When I had the most<br/>awesome idea ever.
Laser tag<br/>rehearsal dinner!
That might be the worst idea<br/>you've ever had,
Which is saying a lot.
Name one bad idea<br/>I've ever had.
Gluten-free edible panties.
Hot dog on a stick<br/>on a bun.
Inflatable sex toy life raft.
The breast<br/>augmentation channel.
Single malt<br/>scotch tape.
The time you ran for mayor.
I still have 12,000 buttons<br/>that say,
"the only poll I care about<br/>is in my pants."
Barney, planning<br/>a wedding
Is all about compromise.
Do you remember that one night,
Right after we got engaged?
Where is this wedding<br/>gonna be, anyway?
You know, I thought<br/>it might be nice
To get married<br/>in canada.
I mean, it's where<br/>I'm from, and...
Okay.
Let's have it.<br/>Get it over with,
Get it all out<br/>of your system.
I'm the groom,
I'm the groom,<br/>I might as well start.
Canada?<br/>What, are we gonna
Walk down the aisle to<br/>crash test dummies?
Play's to marshall.
Canada?<br/>What are you gonna do,
Hire a regular dog sled<br/>or a stretch?<br/>(snorts)
Canada?
Are you registered<br/>at tim hortons?
Lily:<br/>Canada.
Oh, does<br/>the organist play
Wearing mittens?
Marshall:<br/>Canada? How are you gonna
Slip the ring on<br/>the bride's finger
If she's wearing<br/>mittens?
(laughs)
Two mitten jokes<br/>in a row?
So... You're pretty<br/>much done, then?
Narrator:<br/>Kids... We weren't even close.
Canada.
What do we ask on<br/>the wedding invitation?
"will you be having<br/>the elk or the moose?"
Canada.
What, are you gonna<br/>walk down the aisle
Wearing snowshoes?!
(laughing)
Canada.
What, is everyone gonna have<br/>access to universal healthcare
So no one has to choose<br/>between going bankrupt
And treating<br/>a life-threatening illness?
Canada?
W-what's the band gonna play<br/>for your first dance?
Crash test dummies?
(laughing)<br/>see, it's funny
'cause who gets a band?
Enough.<br/>It was just an idea.
Okay, okay.
Seriously, robin,<br/>doing it here in new york
Would be easier, since<br/>all of our friends
And a lot of<br/>our family are here.
But... I want you<br/>to have the wedding<br/>that you want.
So if it's canada...
Just say the word.
(stifles a laugh)
And then say it again<br/>in french.
(laughing)
See? I compromised.
Fine.
We'll just have a nice,<br/>tasteful rehearsal dinner.
Maybe at a french restaurant.
I know just the place.
What's the name<br/>of the restaurant?
La... Ser tag.
You know, I was thinking about
What to get you guys<br/>for a wedding gift.
As you know,
I'm kind of<br/>the wedding gift master.
And, well,<br/>all this talk
Of the rehearsal dinner
Gives me a fantastic idea.
I've been<br/>meaning
To start taking<br/>piano lessons again.
No.
No piano time.<br/>Guys!
Just let me perform something.
I'll-I'll tickle the keys.
It'll be great.
Not even if you<br/>dressed up as liberace.
What if I dressed up<br/>as liberace?
Sold!<br/>Sold.
And that was the end of it.
Until my bachelor party.
Uh-oh.
Let me guess:
There was a stripper.
You had a little fun.
Maybe took some<br/>ill-advised pictures.
Next thing<br/>you know,
She's blackmailing you<br/>into bankruptcy,
And your medical degree's<br/>hanging on the wall
Of a laser tag security office!
No.
The night of my bachelor party,<br/>my friends took me
To a crappy hotel,
Hired my ex-fiancée<br/>to be the stripper,
I lost thousands of dollars,<br/>and my best friend
Even had his hand cut off.
It would've been
The worst night of all time
If the whole thing hadn't been
A prank planned by
My beautiful, amazing fiancée.
She put me through hell<br/>just to give me the best
Surprise of my life... Which,<br/>p.S., included an appearance
By my favorite actor--
Non-porn category.
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
Yeah. Except<br/>pretty not cool,
Because he kept talking about<br/>how he was gonna get me back,
And sure enough,<br/>a few days later...
Robin, there's no<br/>good way to say this.
I've made a huge mistake.
I can't go through<br/>with the wedding.
What?
(choked up):<br/>I'm so sorry.
I-I just...<br/>I had to tell you
Before it was too late.
Oh, my god, you're serious.
Yeah.
And since this is my apartment,
I think that<br/>you should move out.
Fine.
Puppies!
I know.<br/>Great prank, right?
That is awful.
You're a frickin' weirdo.
Such a weirdo.
Careful, watch the robe.
Anyway,
For reasons only<br/>you guys and robin
But nobody normal<br/>like me would understand,
She got cranky.
And she laid<br/>down the law.
No more surprises.
(weird voice):<br/>But you love surprises.
Almost as much as<br/>I love lickin' myself!
That was me talking,<br/>not the puppy.
Barney, the surprises<br/>are out of hand
And they have to stop.
Deal?<br/>But...
Deal?<br/>But...
Deal.<br/>Butt...
Barney...
Fine.
Deal.
Man.
This whole "no more<br/>surprises" thing
Is so unfair.
Who does that?
Barney,<br/>the "no more surprises" thing
Is the best part<br/>of being married.
It's true.<br/>When I wake up<br/>in the morning,
I know what lily's breath<br/>is gonna smell like.
It's like...<br/>Roses.
Do you really<br/>want a marriage
Where you have<br/>this paranoia
That robin's hiding<br/>around every corner,
Planning to get<br/>you back with some<br/>crazy new prank?
You're<br/>absolutely right.
Thank you, lily.
No, th...<br/>That was me,<br/>over here.
He wasn't listening.
If you guys<br/>are saying
What I think<br/>you're saying...
Probably not.<br/>Go on.
...Then that<br/>must mean...
No, it doesn't.
...That robin is<br/>planning a surprise
Laser tag<br/>rehearsal dinner!
Dude, robin is not planning
A surprise laser tag<br/>rehearsal dinner.
Yes, she is.
No, she isn't.<br/>Yes, she is.
No, I'm not!
Yes, she is.
All:<br/>No, she isn't.
Then why did<br/>she pretend
To ridicule it<br/>as an idiotic idea?
Because it is<br/>an idiotic idea.
If robin<br/>actually was
Planning a surprise,
Don't you think she would<br/>tell her maid of honor?
She didn't tell you<br/>'cause you can keep a secret
The way my dentist<br/>keeps his car keys.
You don't know him,<br/>but he's lost them...
Like, twice.
Actually,<br/>just once, and...
That time they were<br/>in his other pocket.
I can't keep a secret?
He does have a point, lily.
You're kind of famous for<br/>the old blabbity-blabbity.
Hey.
How was lunch<br/>with debbie?
Great.<br/>She's pregnant!
(gasps) oops.
I'm not supposed<br/>to tell anybody.<br/>Why not?
Because she's getting<br/>a divorce.
Damn it!
Debbie's getting<br/>a divorce?
Yeah, she walked<br/>in on her husband<br/>having sex.
Oh! Come on, lily.
Well, maybe we don't<br/>need to know every gory...
With a man.
Will you get it<br/>together, aldrin?!
You okay, lily?
And that guy's<br/>the father of the baby.
(sighs)<br/>I gotta go lie down.
Which brings us<br/>to earlier today,
When robin was setting up<br/>the decoy rehearsal dinner,
Complete with fake booze.
Trying to pass<br/>this off as scotch,
And we all know<br/>it's apple juice.
(choking):<br/>Typical apple juice burn.
Yes, barney,<br/>the booze is real.
The food is real.
Ooh, speaking of which,<br/>where are the<br/>bacon-wrapped figs?
Probably at...<br/>(clears throat)
...The laser tag place,
Where the real rehearsal<br/>dinner's going down.
Isn't that right,<br/>theodore?
Barney, there is<br/>no laser tag.
We're gonna have<br/>a nice dinner,
Some drinks,<br/>and then,
According to robin,
If her aunt edith<br/>gets drunk enough,
She'll take off her wig and<br/>they'll play hockey with it.
Poppycock!
You know how<br/>she's gonna do it,
And you're gonna<br/>tell me!
Or do I have<br/>to get my face
Even closer<br/>to yours?
Lily:<br/>Hey.
How come you're<br/>not getting
Uncomfortably<br/>close to my face?
I could be in on it, too.
(both laughing)
'course you could,<br/>lil.
I can keep a secret.
Lily, don't<br/>make me laugh.
I'd trust you<br/>with a secret
As much as I'd trust<br/>marshall with pop secret.
I can keep a secret!
I can keep a secret<br/>real good.
I can keep a secret<br/>like nobody's business,
'cause it is<br/>nobody's business.
'cause it's a secret,
And I'm keeping it!
Does marshall<br/>shave his back?
No, I shave it<br/>for him. Damn it!
Ooh!
I should call<br/>marshall.
I bet he's<br/>in on this.
If he really exists.
Okay.
Setting aside the fact
That I've kept your whole
"moving to chicago" thing<br/>a secret,
Aren't you supposed to be<br/>dressed like liberace right now?
Okay, first of all,
If I showed up in costume,
It would steal from<br/>the surprise and spectacle
Of my grand entrance.
And second of all,<br/>I'm not doing that.
Why not?
Because dressing like liberace<br/>is easy, but...
Uh, yes, 4/4, e-sharp...
Major...
Okay.
Let's make something<br/>beautiful, shall we?
(inhales deeply)
I think that's<br/>enough for today.
Okay, I figured out how<br/>this is gonna go down.
We're gonna "run out" of ice,
And robin's gonna ask me<br/>to go get some,
And lo and behold,<br/>the only place that sells ice
In this whole town is right next<br/>to the local laser taggery.
I go inside and... (gasps)
Surprise!
Beautiful dinner,<br/>family and friends,
Free game tokens<br/>and an off-road arcade game
That's rigged<br/>for unlimited turbos!
That is the<br/>single stupidest...
Guys, you aren't<br/>gonna believe this.
The ice machine<br/>is broken.
Is it now?
Well, dog my cats,<br/>what are the chances?
Huh? What do we do?
Well, I guess I could go get<br/>some ice.
Uh, no,<br/>they'll send someone.
All right, fine.<br/>Twist my arm. I'll do it.
But seriously,<br/>hmm?
Did you get everything set up<br/>over there?
Do you have enough food,<br/>have enough guns?
Did you get a vest extender<br/>for grandma stinson? She's...
What are you<br/>talking about?
Oh, babe, you're so good<br/>at this. I love it.
All right, I'll see you guys<br/>over there.
I mean, be right back.
Barney, barney, this is<br/>our rehearsal dinner, okay?
Do not leave the premises.
Promise me you're not going<br/>anywhere.
Fine.
Say it.
Say you promise<br/>you won't leave.
I promise I won't leave.
So I left.<br/>And what do you know,
The ice store is right next<br/>to a laser tag place!
No, it isn't!<br/>It's six miles away
In the opposite direction.
And I told you not to go!
Yeah, well, you also told me
You didn't want a ring bear<br/>at the wedding.
Ring bear-er!
We all know how great
That's gonna be. The point is,
I played along with her plan,
And I acted "natural" so I<br/>wouldn't spoil the surprise.
Oh, my goodness!
Laser tag?!
Maybe I should go in here<br/>for a minute,
Just check it out<br/>for no apparent reason.
And what's this?
My hands-free token satchel?
And my free lifetime refill<br/>root beer mug?
So for the past<br/>two months
When we were letting you use<br/>our apartment
To practice the piano<br/>every Sunday night,
What were you doing?
Oh, so that's not traveling<br/>'cause he's the mvp?
Come on!
Where's barney?<br/>Has anyone seen him?
Robin, ted's totally bailing
On playing the piano<br/>for you and barney.
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't<br/>have to not do that.
But thank you.
But he promised!<br/>A promise is a promise.
You can't say you're<br/>gonna do something
And then suddenly do something<br/>completely different!
Why are you getting<br/>so worked up about this?
Because, obviously, I'm worked<br/>up for a different
But somewhat similar reason.
And someone should ask me<br/>about it!
I'm sorry. I don't have time<br/>for your drama right now, lily.
My fiancé is missing.
Marshall got picked<br/>to be a judge.
He took the job<br/>without even asking me.
Italy's off!
I have time for your drama.
So, marshall can't go<br/>to Italy?<br/>Not if he wants to be a judge.
And my italian was getting<br/>so good.
It was so (speaks italian).
But wait, you guys already<br/>sublet the apartment.
You're already packed.
Marshall already borrowed<br/>and lost my rosetta stone.
That selfish bastard!
(phone rings)<br/>sorry, lil. Hello.
Okay, I'm mad, too.
I should hope so.
All of a sudden, his dream<br/>is more important than yours?
And he did it behind your back.
Bastardo!
He would never hurt me<br/>intentionally.
I'll hurt him intentionally.
Molto bastardo!
That's sweet of you to say.
You could never take<br/>marshall in a million years,
But that's sweet of you to say.
Well, apparently, barney went<br/>to the laser tag place
Looking for a surprise<br/>rehearsal dinner.
When he didn't find one,<br/>he threatened
To dunk<br/>the snack bar guy's head
Into a vat<br/>of scalding nacho whiz.
He's being held<br/>until the police arrive
I need your apple juice.
Ha!
And here we are.
Now, I believe this charade<br/>has gone on long enough.
Can we please get to the<br/>surprise laser tag rehearsal?
Hey, there is no surprise<br/>laser tag rehearsal dinner!
Okay, but if I may offer<br/>an opposing view.
Of course there is!
This place is lousy<br/>with clues.
Is he even really<br/>a security guard?
Because he looks an awful lot<br/>like a non-pakistani version
Of the guy who delivers<br/>sandwiches at my office.
Also...
"laser tag" has the same number<br/>of letters as "rehearsal."
Laser tag has eight,<br/>rehearsal has nine.
And if you rearrange the letters<br/>and add some other ones,
It says, "get ready, barney,<br/>for the biggest surprise ever,
You handsome son of a..."
And then not quite enough<br/>letters for "bitch,"
But good try, robin.
This is crazy, barney.
We-we can't have a marriage<br/>like this.
A marriage has to be built on<br/>honesty and trust
And all of that lily-<br/>and-marshall crap.
I though our marriage was built<br/>on honesty and trust
And all that lily-<br/>and-marshal crap.
I just feel so alone right now.
Well, you're not. I'm here.
And I know you can keep<br/>a secret.
(scoffs) yeah, right.
Tell you what.
How about I let you in<br/>on another secret?
Something bigger.
Bigger than chicago?
Are you kidding?
Nope. Want to do the honors?
Ladies and gentlemen,
There's been a slight change<br/>of plan.
Fine! Fine.
You're right, robin.
Marriage isn't about playing<br/>crazy pranks.
It isn't about telling<br/>long expertly crafted lies
To cover those pranks...
How'd you get out<br/>of those handcuffs?
...And hiring actors<br/>to play security guards
And spending exorbitant<br/>amounts of money on things
Like giant,<br/>fake laser tag signs.
No, it's about honesty.
Size six skate, right?
And in that spirit,<br/>I got to be honest.
Every now and then,
I am gonna lie to you.<br/>I just am.
If it's in the interest<br/>of an amazing surprise, that is.
You're gonna get bamboozled,<br/>hoodwinked.
Heck, I'll just say it.
You're gonna get snowed.
Why is it snowing in here?
Put on the skates.
We gotta go.
Where?
Where are we going?
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.
Let's get this party started.
What?!
All:<br/>Surprise!
What-what is going on?
I know how much you wanted<br/>to be in canada this weekend.
So I brought canada to you.
Oh, and here's an autographed<br/>picture of wayne gretzky.
Thanks.
And this guy's not really<br/>a security guard.
♪ once there was this boy who
♪ wore a lot of suits and said<br/>that stuff was "legendary" ♪
♪ he gave lots of high fives
♪ and swore...
♪ that he would<br/>never get married ♪
♪ he really thought<br/>he meant it ♪
Thanks for letting me<br/>in on this.
Even if it was<br/>at the very end.
My pleasure.
Oh, and by the way,
There's one more secret<br/>I've been keeping.
All those nights<br/>I was supposed
To be taking piano lessons?
I was actually taking<br/>figure skating lessons!
♪ once, there was<br/>this girl who... ♪
Narrator:<br/>Kids, it takes more<br/>than two months
To learn how to figure skate.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I'm gonna get you back,<br/>you know?<br/>Bring it.
♪ and swore she'd also<br/>never get married ♪
♪ she really thought<br/>she meant it. ♪
I can't believe<br/>you did all of this.
Hey, I thought you<br/>didn't like canada.
Are you kidding?<br/>I love canada.
Holy musk ox,
Is that legendary<br/>canadian doctor<br/>frederick banting?
Whoa!
In 1924,<br/>I discovered insulin.
Take that, diabetes.
Hey, look, it's manitoba's<br/>native son, norman breakey.
You're welcome, world.
Enjoy my invention,<br/>the paint roller.
And of course,<br/>you know alan thicke.
Hey, hey, you...<br/>Oh, hey.
...Are the prettiest girl<br/>in the place.
Oh, thank you,<br/>alan.
All right, all right,<br/>all right.
Good to see you.
Hey, look,<br/>it's louise poirier,
Who I think worked<br/>for the company
That probably created<br/>wonderbra.
(speaks french)
(speaks french)<br/>okay, okay.
Canadians also helped<br/>win two world wars...<br/>Mm-hmm.
...And gave the world<br/>neil young, william shatner,
Leonard cohen,<br/>pamela anderson,
One quarter<br/>of barney stinson,
Instant mashed potatoes,<br/>and best of all, you.
Thank you.

[<div class="full-script">Kids, when your<br/>Uncle Marshall's bus broke down...
... five miles away from the Farhampton Inn,<br/>he made a vow.
I can walk that far.
Yes, it was another exciting<br/>installment of...
Marshall versus the machines
Our hero starts his journey<br/>With steely-eyed resolve
But let's skip ahead to later<br/>With a slow dissolve
So tired, dehydrated
Not making any sense
And wait a second<br/>Why is Bigfoot standing by that fence?
Oh. Hey, you didn't see this.
I'm not hallucinating
Bigfoot really exists
But everyone knows<br/>He quit smoking years ago
Oh, crap, I'm losing it
Excuse me. Hey.
You guys need a lift?
And that's how Marshall met your mother.
This is great, the whole gang together.
Well, almost the whole gang.
Yeah, there's just one beloved piece<br/>of the puzzle missing.
- That bottle of 30-year Glen McKenna Scotch.<br/>- Mm! Mm, mm!
So far, that weekend had been fatal<br/>for not just one...
... but two bottles of $600 Scotch<br/>intended for a special wedding toast.
Also, where the hell is Marshall?
I still can't believe<br/>he took the judgeship behind my back.
Look, I know this is messy,<br/>my dream versus Marshall's dream.
I won't force you guys to choose sides.
Good, because I totally side with Marshall.<br/>That would've been so awkward.
Let's see if they have Glen McKenna<br/>at the bar.
Okay.
Don't be mad. Barney just thinks<br/>if he has ajudge friend...
...he can get all his citations<br/>for public urination thrown out.
How often does Barney pee in public?
A lot.
- But don't worry, I'm on your side.<br/>- Aw.
What's popping, mi amigas?
Oh, boy, who's this idiot?
And which one of us<br/>is he gonna try to make the sex on?
You both look beautiful tonight.
Bro, going for the tricycle. Heh.
Can you imagine having a three-way<br/>with this creep?
Ha, ha. Yeah, right. You, me,<br/>and this guy, naked, going at it.
Then he gets tired<br/>and it's just you and me going at it.
- Uh, Lily?<br/>- That'd be so stupid.
So stupid.
Um, okay, I'll shoot him down.
By the way, I am so psyched<br/>for the wedding tomorrow, Robin.
I'm truly honored that you and Barney<br/>asked me to be a part of it.
We're honored you're here...
...valued invitee.<br/>- Heh-heh.
Help me. Who is this?
Maybe he's one of your long-Iost<br/>Canadian cousins?
Uh, do you happen to have all of your fingers<br/>and teeth?
- Uh, yeah. Heh.<br/>- Not one of my cousins.
Thanks again for picking us up.
It's been a crazy couple days.<br/>You can't imagine what we've been through.
Wait, let me guess.<br/>You were visiting a relative?
Maybe your mother?
And I'm getting a Midwest vibe,<br/>somewhere like Wisconsin... No.
Minnesota?
Wow, you're, like, really good at this.
You're planning an overseas trip<br/>with your wife.
I'm seeing a feisty redhead who loves art.
She just got ajob in Europe.<br/>Maybe France? No. Italy?
Total shot in the dark...
...but Rome?
Maybe I'll just like... I'll get out right here.
You're not going anywhere.
I'm messing with you.<br/>I rode the train with your wife.
She told me all about you.<br/>You must be Marshall.
I was checking on the baby.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
So you guys both got locked out on the roof<br/>in your pajamas?
You guys are hilarious and adorable.
Any idea who this guy is?
No, but I like that he gets how<br/>hilarious and adorable we are.
We are hilarious and adorable.
I'll get the next round.
- Oh, thanks.<br/>- Thanks, Lil.
Hey, I'm sorry if I barged in on you guys.
I can be a little overeager<br/>to connect sometimes.
Probably because of my childhood.
Right. Because of that thing<br/>that happened.
My mother died on a hunting trip<br/>when I was very young.
Yeah, that's it, that's the thing.
Sorry, ugh, too heavy.
So, Robin, what's going on with you?
Oh, nothing. I mean, nothing big anyway.
Hey, hey, hey.<br/>This is me you're talking to.
Well, there is this thing with Lily.
You know, Ted, if you really wanna get a<br/>bottle of Glen McKenna 30-year for Barney...
...I got that last one<br/>at the Farhampton liquor store.
The security there is a total joke.
No, see, I don't wanna know that.<br/>I won't be an accomplice to grand larceny.
I am not confirming or denying a thing.
But there's a high window<br/>in the storage room, and if you climb...
La-la-la! I'm not listening.
I love Barney,<br/>but I'm not going to jail for him.
- What? Why not? I'd go to jail for you.<br/>- No, you wouldn't.
I would. Going to jail for your best friend,<br/>that's the dream.
Really? That's the dream?
Yeah. It's the most noble... Nay, bro-ble.<br/>- Thing a bro can do for a fellow bro.
So, yes, Ted. That's the dream.
- You're too liberal with, "That's the dream."<br/>- Name one other time I said that.
A suit of prosciutto so you can<br/>eat your way naked, that's the dream.
A pack of lions fighting a tyrannosaurus,<br/>that's the dream.
Being able to take a year's worth of dumps<br/>in a non-stop 24-hour period...
...then not having to dump<br/>for the rest of the year, that's the dream.
I never said Dump Day was the dream.
I said science is this close to a pill.
There can only be one "the dream."<br/>You're saying it's going to jail for a bro?
You're comfortable with that<br/>being the one and only dream, forever?
- Yes.<br/>- Great.
Now you can never use that phrase again.<br/>And for me, that's the dream.
Hey, Lily, Robin just told me about Italy.
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great.
Well, that is,<br/>if I can convince my husband...
...to keep his promise<br/>and move there with me.
Robin, I know you told me<br/>you want Marshall to win, but I don't know.
I gotta side with Lily on this one.<br/>Later, skaters.
- Thanks again for saving us.<br/>- Well, I don't normally stop like that...
...but I just had to<br/>for the cutest hitchhiker in the world.
Thank you.
Oh, you're talking about Marvin.
Sorry, it's been a really, really long day.
- When we get there, I'll buy you a drink.<br/>- Thank you.
But after I drop you off,<br/>I'm heading back to the city.
You said your band's playing the wedding.<br/>Why you leaving?
The lead singer. He's the devil.<br/>He's a total fire-starter.
Just ruins people's lives<br/>for his own amusement.
You know,<br/>he will walk up to two friends...
...he will find the one thing that will destroy<br/>their friendship and just, poof...
...burn it to the ground.
Wow, what's his name?
What's popping, mi amigos?
Darren.
You're rooting for Marshall?
Well, why don't you just get<br/>a Team Marshall T-shirt?
What size are you, extra-traitor?
No, no. Okay, no... What I said was...
See, all I meant was...<br/>How did we get here?
That's the question you're left<br/>asking yourself. So here's how he does it.
First, he makes you feel like you're the most<br/>hilarious and adorable person in the world.
You guys are hilarious and adorable.
I like that he gets how hilarious<br/>and adorable we are.
We are hilarious and adorable.
Next, he finds some flimsy connection<br/>based on where you're from.
Cleveland? Gallucci's serves...
...the best pepperoni bread.<br/>- The best pepperoni bread.
And Staten Island?<br/>Guys getting in fights on their front lawns.
It's like you're from there.
This guy's awesome.
So awesome.
I'd totally go to jail for him.
That hurts.
Next, he tells you a deep,<br/>personal secret...
...that's usually the tragic back-story<br/>from an animated kid's film.
My mother died on a hunting trip.
It's often Bambi.
My father was betrayed and killed<br/>by a trusted advisor.
Sometimes he'll throw a little<br/>Lion King in there.
I have no family. But tonight...
...I think maybe I found two brothers.
Sorry, blah, too heavy. Pfft.
- That's okay, man.<br/>- Let me get you a drink.
And then, once your guard is down...
... the emotional prostate exam begins.
So, Ted, what's going on with you?
Well, I mean there was this thing...<br/>Oh, never mind.
Hey, hey, hey.<br/>This is me you're talking to.
Look, all I meant was<br/>that there are two sides here.
Yes, Italy is your dream,<br/>but being ajudge is Marshall's.
Well, that and teaching prop comedy<br/>to a tropical bird.
Parrot Top has nothing to do with this.
Look, I don't need objectivity.
You're my best friend,<br/>I just need your support.
I understand. You got it.
- I'm sorry.<br/>- Oh, me too.
Forgot my phone. Sorry,<br/>you're probably talking wedding details.
No maid of honor's gonna steal<br/>the spotlight with her own problems...
...on the bride's big weekend, am I right?<br/>Keep it real, homeys.
You know, he is right.<br/>Why is this all about you?
You have been preoccupied<br/>with Marshall all weekend.
- I have not.<br/>- You've been sleeping with a doll...
...made of cushions<br/>that you named after him.
Not true. After we do our business,<br/>I make Marshpillow sleep on the couch.
- So there.<br/>- This is so ridiculous.
- So, what did Darren do to you?<br/>- Well, a few years ago, I started this band.
You know, it was a goof.
It was just me and a couple of dorks<br/>from business school.
I'm actually embarrassed<br/>to tell you our name.
I had an all-lawyer band called The Funk,<br/>the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.
I now feel very safe talking about my band,<br/>Super Freakonomics.
- Nice.<br/>- Heh-heh.
Anyway, I brought Darren in<br/>to split lead vocals, and he took over.
First, he took away my solos,<br/>then I got demoted to backup vocals...
...and now the only time I use a mic is after<br/>Darren's first false exit, when I say:
"Do you guys want more Darren?"
And then today, I found this ad online.
- "Ass Player Wanted"?<br/>- Move your thumb.
Oh, "Bass Player Wanted."
- He's gonna kick you out of your own band?<br/>- Yeah.
But instead...
...I quit.
You quit? That's it?
But it's your band, you must be avenged.
Funny you should say that, because as<br/>I was leaving the hotel, I ran into someone.
You need to steal<br/>this douche-monkey's van.
Aldrin justice. Nice.
- Your wife is cool.<br/>- Oh, the coolest.
Hey, did she, um, happen to mention the fact...
...that I'm ruining her dream<br/>of moving to Italy?
Uh, yeah, that did come up.
You need to steal<br/>this douche-monkey's van.
And then run my husband over with it.
- I think you've got a tough talk coming.<br/>- Yeah, well, so do you.
When we get to the inn, you're gonna<br/>go in there and stand up to Darren.
Come on. I Aldrin-justiced him.
But I bet you're just gonna<br/>give this van right back to him.
Were you at least gonna pee in it a little?
I was gonna gas it up and get it washed.
See, you're too nice.
I'm the same way.
Sometimes you gotta get in there<br/>and stand up for yourself.
I always cave<br/>and side with the other person.
I can't handle confrontation.
- Yes, you can.<br/>- You make some good points.
Look, I don't know you,<br/>but I can tell that you're strong.
That's your band.<br/>Don't let Darren steal it away.
No, there's no defeating the devil.
He's someone else's problem now.
I'm sorry if I've been distracted<br/>this weekend.
Oh. Let's not fight anymore, okay?
Oh, good, you finally told Lily you feel like<br/>she's abandoning you by going to Italy.
Honesty is progress. Stay gold.
Oh, Ted, when you move to Chicago,<br/>you gotta try Gazzola's Pizza.
Namaste, hermanos.
You're moving to Chicago?
Is that even a real place?<br/>It's a style of pizza.
Ted, you can't live in a pizza.
I got an amazing job offer there.
Look, Lily knows, but Marshall<br/>and Robin don't, so please keep it quiet.
You're moving to Chicago?!
- He's moving to Chicago.<br/>- Thanks.
When do you move? At least tell me<br/>it's not until next year or something.
It's not until...
...Monday.<br/>- Monday.
So you are just gonna disappear<br/>the day after my wedding?
After ten years of being best friends.
- Marshall's...<br/>- Don't even think about it.
- Fair enough.<br/>- You are gonna give me one day's notice?
I didn't wanna upset you<br/>on your wedding weekend.
No, it's good. It'll be easy to say goodbye<br/>now that I know how much I mean to you.
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I was never really<br/>rooting for Marshall.
I was rooting to not lose my best friend.
But that's selfish.
No matter where you go,<br/>I'm in your corner and I always will be.
And to prove it...
What are you gonna do<br/>with Marshpillow?
Hold his arms back while you beat<br/>the goose down out of this bastard.
Because that's what best friends do.
Thanks. It's not gonna help.
Try it. One punch.
- Ooh. That felt good.<br/>- Mm-hm.
Yeah, that's it, sweetheart.<br/>Head, body, head. Head, body, head.
Barney, wait. Wait.
Your friendship is important.<br/>I swear on my mother's...
No, I swear to God. No, I swear to Hef.
Oh! Don't take that name in vain.
If someone is important to you,<br/>you tell them you're moving.
I'm just some guy you used to know<br/>back in New York.
Hey.
Whoa. How?
That's a $600 bottle.
Ted, that's grand larceny.<br/>You really could go to jail for this.
That's the dream.
So you're moving to Chicago.
I'm moving to Chicago.
Why? I know Marshall and Lily might leave,<br/>but it's only a year.
In the meantime, we'll still see each other<br/>all the time. You, me, Robin...
Oh.
I need a new start.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Well, here we are.
- Good luck in there.<br/>- Thank you.
And don't worry, at the reception, I'll yell:
"The lead singer sucks skunk junk"<br/>after every song.
I'll come up with something better<br/>than "skunk junk."
No, no, "skunk junk" is pretty solid.
You can't yell that at the lead singer...
...because I don't suck skunk junk.
- Wait, are you saying...?<br/>- I'm coming in.
Darren and I are gonna have a chat<br/>about my band.
Whoo!
Skunk junk.
For the record...
...his first word...
...was "Mommy."
This is my band. I started it.
And if anyone is getting fired here,<br/>it's you, Darren.
So hit the bricks, skunk junk.
Was that even a little bit intimidating?
Nope. And the knitting's not helping.
I'm sorry, I just met this baby<br/>and he needs a hat.
You can't fire Darren.
He gets how hilarious and adorable I am.
Plus, it is so inspiring how he overcame<br/>his mother being eaten by a barracuda.
Aah! That's Finding Nemo.
That's new.
There's no defeating the devil.
New plan. Linus, if at any point tonight,<br/>you see me with an empty glass...
Kennedy Package.<br/>It's a very popular choice this weekend.
Thank you, Linus.
Uh, Lily? Lily.
Lily.
Pause?
Pause.
Hi. Mm.
- Thank you, Linus.<br/>- Mm-hm.
There are real villains in this world...
...but they don't always get<br/>real justice, do they?
You wanna believe karma's<br/>gonna get them.
- All right, who wants a drink? I'm stealing.<br/>- Yeah.
But...
...karma doesn't always come through.
I love how strong your marriage is.
You don't need to lose weight,<br/>no matter what he told me.
Catch you on the flip-flop, muchachos.
Sorry, mi amigos.
I guess you have to accept<br/>that sometimes in life...
...you just don't get that knockout punch.
Hey, can I get some ice?
The best man just punched me in the face<br/>for no reason.
Oh, what, that's funny to you?
You know what? I quit.<br/>You can have your stupid band back.
I miss being in a band<br/>where people are decent to each other...
...and there's no drama.
I'm going back to the new Guns N' Roses.
Linus, whoever that best man is...
...I would like to buy him a double<br/>of your finest Scotch.
You started a band
That was cool for a while<br/>But it turned pretty bland
I started a fight
With the neighbor next door<br/>And his pesky wife
Here you go.
Is this from one of you?
- No.<br/>- No.
Okay.
This is incredible. What is this?
It's the Glen McKenna 35-year.
Wait a minute. This whole time<br/>you had Glen McKenna 35-year?
- Why didn't you say something?<br/>- You didn't ask about the 35.
And, kids, that's the first drink<br/>your mother ever bought me.
Hey, Barney? Ahem. I'm so sorry<br/>I missed your rehearsal dinner.
Oh, that's okay. We didn't even know<br/>you weren't here, jerk.
I know it can't make up for being late,<br/>but I did get you a special gift.
- Well, hand it over, fat head.<br/>- You might wanna wait till after the photos.
Hand it over now, travel breath.
Okay, Barney. I'll hand it over.
Ah! It's the fourth slap.<br/>I don't know why I was so obnoxious.</div>]

[<div class="full-script"><br/>Oh, sorry, kids.
I forgot to mention there's a bit<br/>of a back-story to this particular slap.
Oh, man.
At least it landed on the mustard stain.
Don't bother. That suit is a stain.<br/>A stain on the very institution of suits.
You know what tie goes with that suit?<br/>The tie at the top of a Hefty bag.
A suit like that only needs<br/>Self-destruct.
Hey, I bought him that suit.
Where, Barfs Brothers?
Men's Outhouse?
Georgio Arms-Are-Not-<br/>The-Same-Lengthy?
That suit is a slap in the face<br/>to all suits everywhere.
A slap in the face.
Ah, yes, Barney,<br/>there's something I need to tell you...
...about the next slap that you'll receive.
You see, I want this slap<br/>to be as painful as humanly possible.
- Sure.<br/>- Okay, okay.
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Yes, you won a slap bet with me<br/>seven years ago.
And yes, over the years<br/>you got in some great slaps...
Some great slaps.
But here's the problem. You've tormented<br/>me so much that I am now immune to it.
It's as if my face, my psyche, my soul<br/>were covered in that numbing cream...
...we all put on our deal<br/>so that we can go all night, right, fellas?
Okay, we'll all just pretend<br/>like we've never done that.
Just like we've all never sat<br/>on our left hand until it fell asleep...
...and then used it for an away-gamer.
Okay, we'll all pretend<br/>like we've never done that...
...just like we've all never taken<br/>two live jumper cables...
Please, stop.
Barney, I'm well aware that you've<br/>developed a resistance...
...to all of my old tricks, which is why<br/>I sought out special training.
Hi. Hey, I'm sure you<br/>get this question all the time...
...but is there a special class<br/>where I just learn slapping?
We teach kung fu here.
Right. See, the thing is<br/>I don't need to learn anything...
...about kicking, you know, because, uh:
So yeah, I'm good there.<br/>What I really need to learn is slapping.
I need someone to teach me how<br/>to slap my friend just, like, really hard...
...right in his stupid face.<br/>Can you teach me that?
Kung fu is an ancient<br/>and honorable martial art.
It must be learned with great<br/>devotion and respect.
So where are we on this slapping thing?
- Yes, no, maybe...?<br/>- Get out.
Psst. I know what you seek.
You seek to learn the slap<br/>of a thousand exploding suns.
Yes, that's totally a thing I've heard of.<br/>Can you teach me?
No, but I know who can.
Can you take me to this great master?<br/>I have much gold.
It is not one great master you seek,<br/>but three.
They will teach you the three mighty<br/>virtues of slapistry.
Speed.
Strength.
And accuracy.
Put these three virtues together...
...and only then will you have mastered<br/>the slap...
...of a million exploding suns.
I'm sorry to interrupt...
...but a second ago, wasn't it the slap<br/>of a thousand exploding suns?
Pretty sure I said a million. Guys?
- He said a million.<br/>- Definitely.
So I went to Shanghai...
- You didn't go to Shanghai.<br/>- I went to Shanghai.
- When did you go?<br/>- Last year I went.
- You didn't go to Shanghai.<br/>- He went.
- He didn't go.<br/>- Totally went.
- Didn't.<br/>- I went to Shanghai.
In search of the first master.
Are you Red Bird?
Okay, enough.
I know you're trying to freak me out,<br/>but like I said, it's not working.
So I will give you much gold...
...to stop wasting my time.
Hold that thought,<br/>I just wanna see if I can fix this.
The slap of 10 million exploding suns!
Whoops.
Agh. Pfft!
Relax, I'm not gonna slap you right now.
When I slap you, it shall be beneath a<br/>willow tree next to four women and a tiger.
A willow tree, four women and a tiger?<br/>What are you talking about?
Who said anything about a willow tree,<br/>four women and a tiger? Guys?
You were totally silent just now.
But Marshall just said that.<br/>What is going on?
How did you do that to the jukebox?
Wait, it's fake.
That's a prop jukebox<br/>designed just to mess with me.
Marshall, that jukebox cost 8 grand.
I have much gold.
Huh. That is much.
You got lucky, Eriksen.
I don't like this.
I thought nothing I said or did<br/>could intimidate you anymore.
That's right, it can't.
Aah!
Itch. Look, if you're really nervous...
...don't think of it as a slap,<br/>think of it as a high-five.
For your stupid face.
So anyway, I'm in the noodle house.
I'll admit, I didn't expect Red Bird,<br/>master of speed, to be a girl.
- You sure you really know how to...?<br/>- What is the sound of one hand slapping?
I'm sorry, I don't understa...
Wait, how did you...?
Lucky shot, I wasn't ready...
You know, that tip isn't a full 20 percent...
Train me, Red Bird.
- Teach me speed.<br/>- No.
I retired long ago.
- Retired? You're like 32.<br/>- I am 86 years old.
But slapping is now a part of my past.
Darn, I really wanted to slap<br/>Barney Stinson.
This is to slap Barney Stinson?<br/>Yeah, okay, I'll totally teach you.
And so began my training.
Slap this tree.
- Slap the tree?<br/>- Lf you can.
I mean...
...seems pretty easy.
Oof!
What the?
Oof!
The fabled Slapping Tree<br/>of Gongqing Forest.
Beg your pardon, the fabled<br/>Slapping Tree of Gongqing Forest?
- Sure.<br/>- Really? Fabled?
- Because I've never heard of it.<br/>- Pretty sure everybody's heard of it. Guys?
- I backpacked there in college.<br/>- See? Fabled.
It even inspired<br/>a popular Chinese children's book.
It's a poignant parable whose message is<br/>if you love someone, set them free.
But not before first slapping them<br/>right in their stupid face.
As my training continued...
... I also learned the delicate art<br/>of Chinese painting.
That looks nothing like this bowl of fruit.
- My training went on for a year.<br/>- A year?
- A year.<br/>- One year?
None of us noticed<br/>you were stuck in Shanghai for a year?
I wasn't being held slaptive,<br/>I chose to stay and complete my training.
I'm not even gonna... Just, whatever.
You have shown great slaptitude,<br/>young one.
You are ready for your final test.
Slap me.
- What?<br/>- Slap me now.
- No, Red Bird, I can't.<br/>- Slap me. That is not a request.
- I won't.<br/>- The Vikings will never win the Super B...
Wait, how did you...?
Lucky shot, I wasn't re...
That's a big tip.<br/>You must have much gold...
You are ready for your final step.
Awesome. Oh, man, I can't wait to slap<br/>Barney Stinson right across his stupid fa...
What? What did I say?
You must not slap anyone<br/>until your training is complete.
The consequences could be dire.
First you must meet White Flower, the<br/>second master, who will teach you strength.
She lives atop a mountain.
- Which mountain?<br/>- No.
Not Witch Mountain.
Slap Mountain.
- Hate to cut in again, but Slap Mountain?<br/>- That's right.
You're claiming there's a mountain in China<br/>in the exact shape of a hand?
- Everyone knows that. Right?<br/>- Totally.
I backpacked there in college.
It's the largest<br/>of the Slappalachian Mountains.
And at the top...
Excuse me. Do you know where<br/>I can find White Flower?
How dare you speak that name?
That is the most feared name<br/>in 40 villages.
Really? White Flower?
- I'm sorry, just it's not exactly Voldemort.<br/>- Bro.
Why don't you just say Candyman<br/>three times and be done with it? Jeez.
Awesome. Can you teach me<br/>how to do that?
No, I retired from teaching long ago.
- Retired? You're like 32.<br/>- I am 106 years old.
What is in these noodles?
I'm sorry, but my slapping days are over.
Darn, I really wanted this next<br/>Barney Stinson slap to be special.
This is to slap Barney Stinson?<br/>Yeah, okay, I'll totally teach you.
The true power of any slap<br/>comes from the anger behind it.
So for a truly devastating slap,<br/>you must harvest the anger of many.
Every time someone who hates Barney<br/>slaps you in the face...
...the power of their anger<br/>goes from your face into your hand.
White Flower and I made love<br/>that night in the forest.
No, sorry, flag on the play.<br/>You banged White Flower?
I made love to White Flower.
And then I banged her.
- In the forest?<br/>- In Gongqing Forest, yes.
Actually, right near the Slapping Tree.
Which may or may not<br/>have come into play.
Oh, my God, you had a tree-way?
And, Lily, you were okay with<br/>Marshall having an affair?
What happens in the magical<br/>Gongqing Forest...
...stays in the magical Gongqing Forest.<br/>- Best wife ever.
Like I was saying, you need to harvest<br/>the anger of others into your own slap.
Now dig deep. Can you think of anyone,<br/>anyone at all, who hates Barney Stinson?
I know, I almost couldn't get through it<br/>with a straight face.
There are just so many people<br/>who hate Barney's guts.
Moving on.
Ah! Ah.
Point is you need to go get slapped<br/>in the face...
...by a bunch of gullible chicks<br/>Barney banged.
I'm a friend of Barney Stinson... Ooh!
I'm a friend of Barney Stinson... Ugh.
I'm a friend of Barney Stinson... Oh! Unh.
I'm sorry, I thought you said<br/>you were a friend of Barney Stinson.
- I did.<br/>- Oh.
Oh! Unh! Wow.
Could you also slap me in the face?
God, you're just as perverted as Barney.
Oh!
And after a while...
Look at this thing. It's all hot and glowy.
I'll never have cold pizza again.
I'll never have cold pizza again.
Silence.
Sorry. I've just got a slappetite<br/>for destruction. Thanks for everything.
I'm gonna go slap Barney Stinson<br/>in his stupid face.
Wait, first you must go learn accuracy<br/>from the one who is called The Calligrapher...
...in the far-off, mystical land<br/>of Cleveland.
- Cleveland?<br/>- Cleveland.
Why Cleveland?
It's the city equivalent<br/>of being slapped in the face.
Bro.
Man, is this place a chain or something?
- One for dinner?<br/>- No.
I am here to meet her.
Bro.
- Can you teach me accuracy?<br/>- I can.
The proper question is, will I?
Grammar is the first step<br/>on the thousand-mile journey to accuracy.
I'm assuming there's no<br/>Mrs. The Calligrapher.
The path I've chosen is Ionesome.
But it's no big deal.<br/>I prefer being alone. I really do.
Unless you know any single ladies<br/>you could set me up with...
- Nope.<br/>- Good, because I prefer being alone.
Also, I'm sorry,<br/>but I retired from teaching long ago.
Retired? You're like 35.
I'm 34.
- Oh, sorry.<br/>- I use moisturizer every night.
- I thought my skin still looked vibrant.<br/>- It does, it does.
Look, I'm really just here<br/>to finish my training.
Um, so look, the truth is...
...I have a divorced cousin<br/>just outside of Akron.
Now, I wouldn't call Janice<br/>easy on the eyes...
...or the springs of a bathroom scale...
...but if you want I could set you up.
Sold. Now, the most important lesson<br/>in learning accuracy...
He was dying right before my eyes.
So I did the only thing<br/>that I could think to do.
Please.
I slapped his back.
And that's when I found out why "no<br/>slapping until your training is complete"...
...is the most important rule,<br/>because my slap...
...was too powerful.
I hadn't learned accuracy<br/>and so I couldn't control it.
And, well...
No!
Stop it. Just stop.
You did not slap the heart<br/>out of a man's body.
If only that were true.
You're saying<br/>that you committed a murder?
- I was trying to save him.<br/>- Shh!
Baby, it's okay, you didn't mean to.<br/>He doesn't sleep.
- You gotta move on.<br/>- You're making this whole story up.
I wish that I were.
Because of the tragedy, I never got to finish<br/>my training. I never learned accuracy.
Because of that, I shall remain forever...
...a mere slapprentice.
What does that mean, baby?
Here's what it meant.
Whoa!
- Huh? Ah!<br/>- Damn it.
Please, somebody, help me!
There's a crazy guy<br/>trying to slap me and he's...
Oh, my God.
Four women and a willow tree.
At least there's no tiger.
Oh, my God.
Is that...
...half a tiger?
You got here early.
- It's time.<br/>- But you never completed your training.
Actually...
Listen to me, I must speak fast. Once you've<br/>had your heart slapped out of your body...
...you've only got 10, 15 minutes to live.<br/>- Sure.
The trick to accuracy is to,<br/>like, try to be really accurate, okay?
Don't just slap, like, really try to aim.
Look where you're slapping.<br/>That's important.
And then try to slap that spot<br/>instead of some other spot.
Well, I guess that's pretty much it.<br/>You can slap people now. Unh!
- He's gone.<br/>- One other thing.
Cleveland has a lot to offer.
Be sure to check out<br/>the James A. Garfield monument.
He was only president for four months<br/>before he was assassinated.
But if you get up to the top,<br/>you can see almost 30 miles...
...as long as the steel factory's<br/>not smelting. Ugh!
Agh!
He's gone.
No, like I said, 10, 15 minutes.
- Oh, God, this is awkward.<br/>- Yeah.
Like when you say goodbye<br/>to someone...
...then you realize you're both headed<br/>in the same direction.
It's like, "What, do we say goodbye<br/>again or...?" Unh.
Agh!
He's gone.
Wait, are you just pretending<br/>so it'll be less awkward?
Should I just, like, go or?
Okay.
My training is complete.
I'm ready.
I'm ready too.
- I love you.<br/>- Enough to take this slap for me?
No.
Oof!
Whoa!
- Good one, you got me that time.<br/>- Hey, only one slap left.
- Crazy. Where did the time go.<br/>- I know, it's like, slow down, life.
Hey, was that a fake jukebox?
- Yeah, fake jukebox.<br/>- Nice, nice.
- Oh, man.<br/>- All right.
- You okay? Yeah?<br/>- Yeah, yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, Boyz II Men.
What is this feeling
That's put you in your place?
A hot red burning<br/>On the side of your face
You feel the blood rush to your cheek
Tears start to fill your eyes
Your lips are trembling but you can't speak
You're trying, oh you're trying<br/>Not to cry
- You just got slapped, oh<br/>- Slapped
Across the face, my friend
- You just got slapped, oh, yes<br/>- Just got slapped
- It really just happened<br/>- Oh, yes, it did
Oh, everybody saw it, ha
And everybody laughed and clapped
Everybody saw it, ow
And everybody laughed and clapped
- 'Cause it was awesome<br/>- So awesome
Oh, oh
The way that you just got slapped
Oh, yeah
- Mm.<br/>- Heh.
One more.</div>]

[<div class="full-script">WOMAN:<br/>Okay. It's over.
TED:<br/>Starting the clock now.
[SIGHS]
- Labor sucks, huh?<br/>- Yeah.
That fun-sounding name?<br/>It's totally misleading.
[CHUCKLES]
We better have this baby soon.<br/>You know my mom's rule.
- "Nothing good happens after 2 a.m."<br/>- I don't buy it.
Just like I don't buy<br/>what her son told me.
"Let's go away for one last weekend<br/>before the baby comes. We'll be fine."
I hate to point fingers,<br/>but you should never listen to me.
- You know that.<br/>- That's my bad.
Ow.
- Here comes another one.<br/>- Already?
- Yep.<br/>- Okay. We should get you to the hospital.
- Okay.<br/>TED: Ah, here we go.
You can't still see where<br/>Marshall slapped me?
Your face looks like a "don't walk" signal.
Like a photo negative<br/>of the Hamburger Helper box.
A palm reader could tell Marshall's future<br/>by studying your face.
The phrase "Talk to the hand because the<br/>face ain't listening" doesn't work for you...
...because the hand is on your face.
A simple "yes" would've sufficed.
Aw, baby, I missed you so much...<br/>I am so angry!
I am gonna tear you apart tonight.
- I'm gonna tear you apart tonight!<br/>- Okay.
Okay. We said we wouldn't fight until the<br/>gang's all done hanging out, remember?
TED: Ever since Lily heard that Marshall<br/>had accepted an offer to be a judge...
... thus jeopardizing their planned year in<br/>Italy, they both knew a big fight was coming.
But when they finally saw each other...
Pause?
Pause.
TED: See, Lily and Marshall had a long tradition<br/>of hitting "pause" on their arguments.
Sometimes they paused because<br/>they suddenly had other things to do.
We have to stick to our budget, okay?
You cannot be out there buying<br/>all these Brazilian bikini waxes...
...and Kama Sutra body oils and edible...<br/>Pause.
TED: Sometimes they paused to keep<br/>their fights from changing subjects.
Baby, I cannot put up with your shoes<br/>being all over the house.
Why not?<br/>I put up with your terrible mother.
- Pause.<br/>- Pause.
TED:<br/>Now that they were paused...
... Marshall realized he would do anything<br/>to stay paused for as long as he could.
Okay, time to go to bed.<br/>Big day tomorrow.
- Big day tomorrow!<br/>- Screw tomorrow! We go big tonight!
Huh?
- We go big tonight!<br/>- We go big tonight!
I mean, come on, you know,<br/>what time is it anyway?
Hey, where's the baby?
- The elevator!<br/>- The elevator!
Ha, ha. That joke just never gets old.
And is not at all inspired<br/>by real life events.
No, it is not. Anyway,<br/>the sitter has Marvin for the night.
Oh! And now, the best thing<br/>to come out of my cross-country trip...
...a little segment I like to call:
"Embarrassing Souvenirs<br/>I Picked Up From Ted's Childhood Home."
[ALL LAUGHING]
"Totally awesome Ted."
You steal this off some kid named Ted?<br/>I'm getting warmed up.
This is fun. We're all... I'm having fun.
When you squeeze this toy, a recording<br/>of Ted says, "I love you, Mommy."
That's sweet.<br/>Why would we make fun of him for that?
He gave it to her when he was 19.
TED [ON RECORDING]:<br/>I love you, Mommy.
[LAUGHING]
And lastly, a photo of young Ted and his<br/>best friend dressed up like cowboys.
No. All right, leave him alone.
His best friend was a balloon.
ROBIN: I wanna see that picture<br/>more than I wanna get married.
- Ha-ha-ha!<br/>- I hate you so much.
[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]
[LAUGHING]
TED: Over the years, we'd seen all sorts<br/>of levels of Barney's drunkenness.
- How you doing?<br/>TED: Richard Dawson drunk.
Is this your sister?
TED:<br/>"Big plans with strangers" drunk.
Me and the Road Dawgs are going splitsies<br/>on a time share in Flint, Michigan.
And non-refundably booked. Come on,<br/>I'm gonna buy you all some mopeds.
Road Dawgs!
TED:<br/>And Marcel Marceau drunk.
But we knew the night was over<br/>whenever Barney got Jabba drunk.
So drunk that his speech bore<br/>an uncanny resemblance to that of...
... Jabba the Hutt from<br/>Return of the Jedi.
[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Okay, we have to go to bed.<br/>Big day tomorrow.
- Big day tomorrow.<br/>- Han Solo!
- Screw tomorrow. Let's go big tonight!<br/>- We go big tonight.
No, Marshall, let's go now.
Okay, okay.<br/>Look, I guess we have to do this.
First off, I know how important<br/>Italy was to you...
- Shut up and do me.<br/>- Ooh...
Okay, we have to go to bed.
Yeah, I need to get my ear hair trimmed<br/>in the morning.
It's like a rainforest in there.
Uh, why would you volunteer<br/>that information?
Because it's the truth.<br/>Also, I peed a little on my tie at the urinal.
Uh, Barney, who's taller, me or you?
You're taller. I wear lifts in my shoes.
Oh, my God, Robin.<br/>Barney has reached a whole new level.
He's truth serum drunk. He can't lie.
So we can finally get the answers<br/>we've always been wondering about.
You said you had to get to bed, but...
Screw tomorrow.
- We go big tonight.<br/>- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.<br/>- Hey, buddy.
Wait, we're not unpaused?
Not yet. Mama needs some Papa.
As soon as we're done having sex,<br/>we're having that fight.
So we're not gonna fight...
...until after we're done having sex.
Challenge accepted.
So just to be clear, after we finish having<br/>sex, that's when we'll have our fight?
- That's right.<br/>- Excuse me.
Okay, Marshall, it's go time.
You've had great nights of sex before,<br/>most of them with Lily.
A few by yourself.
And we'll always have that unscrambled<br/>Spice Channel glitch of '93.
But this has gotta be<br/>the performance of a lifetime.
Jimi Hendrix at Monterey.
James Brown at the Apollo.
Your law school funk band<br/>pretty much anywhere.
So get out there and bang your wife<br/>for as long as you possibly can.
Not a good sign<br/>that I'm already out of breath.
So Barney will answer any question<br/>we ask him with the truth?
I think so.
Honey, when that Bryan Adams song<br/>came on the radio...
...did two mosquitoes really fly<br/>into your eyes at the same time?
No. I got all choked up thinking about how<br/>everything he does, he does it for her.
Checks out.
Okay, what next? It's hard to know<br/>where to begin, there are so many...
What did you do to my mom?
BARNEY:<br/>Well, that night, we were in my car...
I was wrong. I can't handle this.<br/>Just tell me in baseball terms.
I got thrown out<br/>trying to stretch a single into a double.
I can live with that.
How about that time you walked<br/>into the bar wearing triple X-ray goggles?
- Well, hello, you two lovely ladies.<br/>- What are you wearing?
Oh, hey, Robin, didn't see you there.<br/>Just triple X-ray goggles, no big deal.
There is no way those things work.
I'm not even here, just act natural.
Right, because that jacket's made of lead.
Those things didn't work, did they?
Absolutely, Lily's boobs always<br/>work for me. Oh, the goggles? No.
Next question.
You keep saying "ring bear"<br/>instead of ring bearer.
Will there or will there not<br/>be a bear at our wedding?
The truth is...
[BABBLING]
He's dipped back down to Jabba drunk.<br/>Give him another drink.
Oh, yeah, baby, I could go all night.
MARSHALL:<br/>I can't hold out much longer.
What are the least arousing things<br/>I can think of?
MAN [SINGING]: Day-old roadkill<br/>Oh, yeah
Fingernail, fingernail clippings
[MAN HUMMING]
How your TMJ night guard smells<br/>In the morning
Nasty
Bugs, mm!
More bugs
MARSHALL:<br/>It's working. It's working.
Uh-oh, it's working too well.<br/>Think sexy thoughts. Think sexy thoughts.
MAN [SINGING]:<br/>Bugs with boobs
LILY: Marshall, are you all right?<br/>You don't seem to be...
Please excuse Medium-Sized Fudge.
- Six and three sixty-fourths inches.<br/>- He's back to telling the truth.
Okay, how are you always able to do that<br/>magic trick where you make doves appear?
Special dehydrated birds<br/>I get in Chinatown.
I knew it.
Okay, okay.
Will there or will there not<br/>be a bear at our wedding?
- The truth is...<br/>MARSHALL: Barney?
Oh, come on!
Barney, I know you always say you don't<br/>need any kind of "help" in bed, but if you...
I always keep these on hand,<br/>but be careful.
When you go off,<br/>there's a kickback like a cannon.
Thank you.
How much a year<br/>do you spend on suits?
TED: Kids, I won't bother you with the number,<br/>but it was a crapload.
Around one crapload.
That much? Aren't you concerned<br/>about your future?
Nope. Especially since Robin<br/>is massively wealthy.
- Barney!<br/>- What?
You're rich? Like how rich?
My family's money, not mine.<br/>I don't know...
- How much is her family worth?<br/>- Six thousand craploads.
- Canadian craploads.<br/>- That much?
But when we dated,<br/>I paid for everything.
- You didn't pay for everything.<br/>- He paid for everything.
- I'd pick up our bar tab all the time.<br/>- Three times in nine years.
- I took you to four-star restaurants.<br/>- Two-star restaurants.
Figuring on average two meals out a week,<br/>plus 20 percent tip...
- Twelve-and-a-half percent tip.<br/>- You know how much money you cost me?
- What am I, a prostitute?<br/>- You are not a prostitute.
- No, a prostitute would have been cheaper.<br/>- Depends on the prostitute.
Wait, hold on, Ted. What are we doing?
Arguing about Robin's wealth. You should<br/>be asking me embarrassing questions.
He's right. Let's do this.
TED: And so we did it. We asked Barney<br/>all the questions we'd always wanted to.
In one night? Four.
In one family? Three.
Yes, but not while she was<br/>secretary of state.
Yes, but not while she was<br/>secretary of state.
Just once.<br/>With a French male model, Henri.
It was late, we were the last two people<br/>in the club.
I was Ionely and I figured, why not try it?
That was the only time I ever split a cab.
Yes, but not the MIT you're thinking of:<br/>The Magicians Institute of Teaneck.
I've had sex in Ted's bed 14 times.
I asked if you wear shoulder pads.
I think I've just got one question left,<br/>and it's a biggie.
Barney Stinson,<br/>what do you do for a living?
You did it.<br/>You banged your wife to sleep.
Nice job, Still-Big Fudge.
TED [ON RECORDING]:<br/>I love you, Mommy.
Unpause.
TED:<br/>Kids, in all the time we knew Barney...
... there was one question he would<br/>always answer the same way.
- Seriously, what is it that you do?<br/>- Ha-ha-ha. Please.
Seriously, what do you do for a living?
Ha-ha-ha. Please.
You finally gonna tell me<br/>what yourjob is?
Ha! Please.
TED: So naturally,<br/>this was a pretty big moment for us.
Well? What do you do for a living?
Please.
He's not telling us. More booze.
Not so fast, princess.
I guess subtle clues and the bar tab<br/>are two things you don't pick up.
Because I think he is telling us.
Tell us more about this job.
BARNEY:<br/>Well, as you know, back in my hippie days...
... a man came into my coffee shop,<br/>told me money was all that mattered...
... and stole my girlfriend.
That's when I decided<br/>to become awesome.
But I had no idea<br/>how to break into the corporate world.
Hoping he wouldn't recognize me,<br/>I went to the person...
... from whom I knew I could learn<br/>everything.
- Do we know each other, bro?<br/>- We're all connected in Gaia's tapestry of...
No. We don't. Bro.
Wow, you went to MIT.<br/>Pretty impressive.
I did get a perfect score on the ACTs.
Advanced card tricks.
Look, buddy, you got a sweet resume,<br/>but we don't have openings you're qualified...
They set me up! It was a trap! It's a trap!
We have one opening you'd be perfect for.
Great. What do I do?
Please.
"Provide legal exculpation<br/>and sign everything."
Just show up, scribble your name on<br/>documents, we pay you 16 craploads a year.
The deets are in the contract.<br/>I'll give you time to think about it.
- I'll take it.<br/>- Hold on.
- Did you even read this before signing it?<br/>- No.
You're hired.
We'll work on that.
Wait. You sign sketchy, legally binding<br/>documents that could implicate you...
...for God-knows-what?<br/>- Best job ever, right?
No more pausing.<br/>We're getting through this argument.
Okay. But no pot shots at my mom.
- Fine. No distracting me with your calves.<br/>- Fine.
I love you, Lilypad.
I love you, Marshmallow.
Now...
...how could you take that job<br/>without telling me?
Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed<br/>an answer right away.
This is a huge opportunity. It could be good<br/>for our family. We have to talk about it.
Sorry, you lost your chance to talk about it<br/>when you didn't talk about it.
We're going to Italy.
But I could be ajudge. We can't give<br/>that up for what is clearly just a hobby.
- Pause.<br/>- No pause.
That hobby is my dream.<br/>We're going to Italy.
- It's my dream to...<br/>- We are going to Italy.
- Baby, can you just...<br/>- We are going to Italy. Don't you get it?
You went behind my back. You hurt me.
You were more selfish<br/>than I've ever been to you.
You broke up with me<br/>and moved to San Francisco.
Barney, you're being stupid.
The company is setting you up as<br/>their fall guy for all of their illegal activities.
No, you guys are being stupid.<br/>Especially Ted.
What? I didn't say anything.
TED: And then, kids,<br/>Barney revealed to us his master plan.
It all went down a few months<br/>after the wedding.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey, Greg? I know you're busy...
...but I've been colluding with the feds.<br/>They know everything.
They are on their way to shut down this<br/>division and arrest you. Door closed, or...
What? Why would you do that?
Oh, gosh, countless moral reasons<br/>could have applied.
But this is pretty much revenge<br/>for stealing my girlfriend.
See, that day I vowed I would do<br/>everything in my power to track you down...
... gain your trust and then destroy you.
- Who are you?<br/>- Who am I?
Just a guy who served you coffee once.
Peace out, loser.
MAN [SINGING]:<br/>Barney Stinson, Barney Stinson
You son-of-a-bitch. I'll destroy you!<br/>Get your hands off of me!
Awesome<br/>Awesome
Why are you bringing up San Francisco?<br/>That was seven years ago.
Because you are being selfish<br/>all over again.
Marshall,<br/>I apologized over and over again.
Now you're saying<br/>you've never forgiven me?
There is nothing more important to me<br/>than our family, you know that.
Well, let me ask: What if you'd found<br/>success in San Francisco?
How do I know that you<br/>even would have come back to me?
Stop it.
Are Marvin and I and any other<br/>future children we may have...
...just some consolation prize?
I have to get out of here.
Babe...
So, Barney, I still haven't heard you<br/>pronounce that last syllable.
At our wedding,<br/>will there be a ring bearer?
The truth is:
Yes, there will be a ring bearer.
His name is Trevor Hudson,<br/>I worked with his mother, and he's adorable.
I want our wedding to be perfect, Robin.
Me too.
I'm gonna go.<br/>He's okay to crash with you?
Yep. We'll see you in the morning.
Hmm.
- I love you.<br/>- I love you too.
[SIGHS]
Okay, I got one last question for you<br/>and I can't believe I haven't asked it yet.
Dude, you're getting married tomorrow.<br/>How are you doing?
Good. I mean, I'm a little nervous.
But I love Robin more than<br/>I've ever loved anyone.
I'm gonna do everything<br/>I can to make her happy.
For a long time, deep down,<br/>I felt sort of... broken?
But I don't feel that way anymore.
Robin, along with the idea<br/>that vengeance will soon be mine...
...has made me 100 percent awesome.
I'm proud of you, buddy.
[BABBLING]
Okay. Come on, Jabba.<br/>Big day tomorrow.
Tab for the night.
Just so you know, those last few rounds of<br/>35-year Glen McKenna were not cheap.
Whoa. Um...
You know what?<br/>Charge them to the bride's room.
- Okay.<br/>- Thank you.
Come on, let's go. We got you.
TED: Kids, it's your grandmother's favorite rule:<br/>"Nothing good happens after 2 a.m."
Hi. I know it's late,<br/>but I've gotta get out of here.
Marshall and I just had a huge fight.
You will? Oh, my God, thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
- Everything is fine. Don't freak out.<br/>- I'm not.
- I was talking to myself.<br/>- Do you have the baby?
- The elevator!<br/>- What?
- Marshall and Lily are right, never gets old.<br/>- Unless you're crowning.
- So proud of you.<br/>- Thank you.
Penny's so proud of you.
Let's go get you a brother, okay?
- You want a brother? I love you.<br/>- I love you too.
- You're gonna be great.<br/>- Yeah, okay.
TED: Nothing good happens<br/>after 2 a.m., it's a good rule.
But every rule has an exception.
And for us, that exception was you, Luke.
We're having a baby!
Come on, Trevor Hudson.<br/>It's feeding time.
[BEAR ROARING]

[<div class="full-script">- You're my best friend, Barney.<br/>- Good.

Say man, don't walk ahead of that woman<br/>Like she don't belong to you
Just 'cause her got them little skinny legs
You know that ain't no way to do
You didn't act like that when you had it home<br/>Behind closed doors, all right
Now you act like you're ashamed of a woman
Don't even want nobody to know she's yours
That's all right, you just walk on baby
And don't you worry about<br/>A doggone thing at all
Excuse me. Pardon me.<br/>Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
There's some man, somewhere<br/>Who'll take you baby, skinny legs and all
I am so, so sorry.<br/>I went to the one on the West Side.
I was beginning to think<br/>you'd forgotten about me.
The night Aunt Lily<br/>and Uncle Marshall got engaged...
... the night I met Aunt Robin,<br/>was the night of your mom's 21st birthday.
- Happy birthday. Where's Max?<br/>- He couldn't get a cab.
Which is code for "waited until<br/>the last minute to get me a gift."
Although he always nails it.
Two years ago, he got me an exact replica<br/>of the Pee-wee's Big Adventure bike.
And last year,<br/>he got me a one-man-band suit...
...including knee cymbals.
And these are things you want?
- No, these are things I need.<br/>- Ha, ha.
- Oh, that's Max. I gotta take this.<br/>- Okay.
Okay, you're officially super late now.
Yes, this is she.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
You've been sitting around for two years.<br/>It's time to get back out there.
I have not been sitting around.<br/>I've been hard at work.
I think I'm about to enter my<br/>robots-doing-track-and-field-events period.
It's a very exciting time.
Sweetie, I love you,<br/>and I can't imagine what it was like...
...going through what you went through,<br/>but these are your 20s.
It's Saint Patrick's Day,<br/>the holiday of my people.
- You're not Irish.<br/>- Binge drinkers.
- Now, let's go.<br/>- No, please don't make me go out there.
- It's gonna rain.<br/>- Bring your umbrella.
How is the bathroom line this long,<br/>and yet the floor is covered with urine?
If there's urine out here,<br/>what is going on in there?
- Screw this, we're holding it. Let's dance.<br/>- No, thanks.
This is what I'm talking about.
The love of your life could be on that dance<br/>floor waiting for you to bump into him.
If you're not there,<br/>he's gonna bump into someone else.
Somehow I doubt it.
- Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>- Oh, that's okay.
- I'm going in.<br/>- Wait, is that?
- Mitch.<br/>- No way.
- Hi.<br/>- What are you doing in New York?
- I live here. This is my friend Kelly.<br/>- What?
- Hi.<br/>- Mitch was my instructor at orchestra camp.
- Orchestra camp?<br/>- Mm-hm.
It's not as lame as it sounds.<br/>We also did physics. So...
- What are you up to these days?<br/>- Still teaching orchestra.
I'm at this public school in the Bronx.<br/>It's totally underfunded.
- A lot of the kids can't afford instruments...<br/>- Take my cello.
- What?<br/>- Yeah, you gotta take it.
I haven't played it in years.<br/>It's sitting in my closet.
- Give it to the kids.<br/>- Are you sure?
- Do you wanna come and get it right now?<br/>- Um, okay.
- Okay, great. Let's go.<br/>- Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, yes, you're doing something nice,<br/>but you're still bailing on me.
- So I guess karmically, it evens out?<br/>- I'm just worried about you.
Don't be. Have fun.
And who knows?<br/>Maybe you'll bump into someone tonight.
Oof.
Girl, I will "shamrock" your world.
I'Il... We'Il... Okay.
Okay, here it is.
I haven't played this since the popular girls<br/>locked me inside the case.
Although it was roomier<br/>than when I played the violin.
- What are you doing?<br/>- I don't know. What am I doing?
- What are you doing?<br/>- This is my thing.
It certainly is. Please cover your thing up.
Sorry. I meant this move, it's my thing.<br/>I call it "The Naked Man."
A few weeks ago,<br/>I was on a date, and it worked.
Then another date, it worked again,<br/>so I figured it would work all the time.
- Now you know it doesn't work all the time.<br/>- Yeah.
Although two out of three.
Is this what it's gonna be like<br/>being single in New York?
Even the nice guys<br/>turn out to be total creeps?
I have gotten pretty creepy<br/>since I moved here.
I feel so lost right now.
I don't even know<br/>what I'm doing with my life.
- Can I tell you an embarrassing story?<br/>- Is it this one taking place right now?
I felt lost for a long time too.
I was living in my parents' basement...
...playing video games,<br/>mastur... ing those games.
Until I finally woke up and realized I wanted<br/>to follow my dream of teaching music.
Let me save you a few years.
Even if it sounds completely crazy,<br/>what is it you wanna do with your life?
I want to end poverty.
Great. Then every decision you make<br/>from here on out...
...should be in service of that.
Oh. Thanks.
You know, for a minute there,<br/>I totally forgot you were naked.
In a way, aren't we all naked?
Yeah, but your balls are on my couch.
- Hug?<br/>- I will take a rain check.
- It's raining now.<br/>- Oh, my umbrella.
I will be right back. Long story.
- Nothing happened, I swear.<br/>- Then why are you naked?
Oh, what the hell?
When I got to the club,<br/>it had already closed.
By the next day, some super-inconsiderate<br/>person had taken my umbrella.
But by that point, I didn't care.
I knew if I really wanted to end poverty...
...I had to get a degree in economics.
So to answer your question,<br/>that's how I got here.
I meant how did you get here<br/>from the subway station.
- Oh.<br/>- I'm asking because I just moved to town.
I don't even have a place to live yet.
Yeah, you do.
Come live with me.<br/>My roommate just moved out.
Are you sure? You just met me.<br/>I could be a serial killer.
I like to believe in people.
Plus, what are the chances<br/>that we're both serial killers?
Promise me there won't be naked men<br/>in the living room.
Not a problem.
I'm on permanent hiatus<br/>in the love department.
- Really? I find that hard to believe.<br/>- I guess I'm old-fashioned.
I believe that each of us only gets one.<br/>And I got mine already.
Well, if you ask me,<br/>you know what comes after the one?
- The next one.<br/>- Oh, yeah.
Well, I don't really see that happening<br/>any time soon.
Hi. Is this Room 7?
And so if you must bring food to this class,<br/>please bring enough for everyone.
I don't wanna see someone eating, say,<br/>lobster in the front row...
...without sharing with the rest of us...
...because that would be "shellfish."
Come on, that was funny.
- Anyway, this is Architecture 101.<br/>- Architecture 101?
I'm in the wrong class. I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Wait, I was in the right class.
First day as a professor, wrong classroom.<br/>Coming through.
You play bass?<br/>Seriously, ask my friends.
I always say my ideal woman<br/>does not play bass...
...because this is clearly<br/>your roommate's.
- She's in a band.<br/>- Damn, that's cool.
This is unbelievable.
You just picked out the only three things<br/>in here that are my roommate's.
- Does your roommate's band ever play...?<br/>- Get out.
Okay, this is crazy.
Do you know where this umbrella<br/>came from? Because I could've sworn l...
- What's wrong? Are you okay?<br/>- We broke up.
Ugh. Well, I never liked him,<br/>and I never thought he deserved you...
...and I am sorry.<br/>I didn't know you were dating someone.
Who was this?
He was the architecture professor,<br/>the one who taught Econ 305 by accident.
Oh. That guy?
- Why did you break up?<br/>- He's got a thing for you.
What? What? He's... What?
How could he have a thing for me?<br/>He's never even met me.
He didn't have to.
Everything he saw of yours,<br/>he went crazy for.
You should have brought him<br/>to my room.
He would've run screaming once he saw<br/>my calligraphy set, my coin collection...
...my chain-mail corset<br/>from the Renaissance fair.
Well, that's pretty cool.
Come on,<br/>how could he not be in love with you?
The way you fall asleep on the couch<br/>doing the crossword.
- When did he see me fall asleep...?<br/>- The way your hair smells.
The way your eyes sparkle...
- I might have some stuff to figure out.<br/>- You might.
- I'm so sorry.<br/>- No, uh, it's okay.
It was nice.
I haven't been kissed<br/>in a really long time.
Not long after that, she met a nice girl,<br/>and they fell in love, so it's a happy ending.
For Cindy, anyway.
I, however, am left without a roommate.<br/>So here we are.
Ha.
I have a confession. Uh...
I don't need a place to live.
I saw your ad for the roommate,<br/>and I just really wanted to meet you.
I'm a huge fan of your band,<br/>Super Freakonomics.
Oh, my gosh. Really?
Really. I come to all your shows.<br/>And I'm not just saying this:
I think you guys are the best<br/>economic-themed band in the entire city.
Even better than Radio-Hedge Fund?
Oh, absolutely.<br/>I wish I had the guts to do what you do.
I love to sing, but...
You know what?
Next time we do a show, you have got to<br/>come up on stage with us and sing a song.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
No, I'm too shy.
But maybe just one song.
I don't like to think of<br/>Super Freakonomics as my band.
I think of it as my canvas,<br/>upon which I paint my masterpieces.
And that right there is why I don't<br/>play bass. Ha-ha-ha.
Can I help you with that?
Uh... Wow.
- Thanks, Superman.<br/>- No problem.
It was either help you<br/>or stop a train going off a cliff.
- And you're much cuter.<br/>- Ha, ha.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no, sorry, I'm 16.
Oh. Wow.
Sorry. Have a good night.
Wait, you believed that? I like you.
Sure, you can buy me a drink.
MacLaren's. The last time I was here,<br/>I thought this place was called Puzzles.
That's an odd name.<br/>Why would you call a bar Puzzles?
Unless that's the puzzle.
Well, um, thank you for the drink.
So do you wanna get dinner sometime?
Um...
Louis, you're really nice,<br/>but I was in love with somebody...
...a long time ago, and he died.
- Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>- No, I'm sorry. Um...
It's silly, but it's like the first lottery ticket<br/>I ever bought...
...was, kaboom, jackpot.
And I'm pretty sure<br/>I'm not gonna win again.
Not like that, anyway.
So I don't generally<br/>buy lottery tickets anymore.
I understand.
So I should go.
Well, if you change your mind,<br/>give me a call.
Okay. Now we're even.
- So we got dinner.<br/>- And?
- He's nice.<br/>- Nice? He sounds amazing.
Handsome, good dresser, paid for dinner.<br/>What more do you want?
Do you know how rough it is out there?
I once met a guy claiming to be a genie<br/>whose penis grants wishes.
Oh, my God.<br/>Who would even fall for that?
The point is, Louis sounds great.
And that's how your mom<br/>started dating Louis.
And for a little while there, it was fine.
One tasty English muffin
Baby, that is what I am<br/>Ba-da, da-da-da, da-da
One tasty English muffin
With some raspberry jam
That's funny.
It just wasn't love.
But then fate intervened.
You guys wouldn't, uh,<br/>happen to know of any wedding bands...
...available at the last minute, would you?
Hi. One ticket to Farhampton, please.
Louis had a house in Farhampton,<br/>so he let your mother stay there.
The day before the wedding,<br/>as she was taking cookies out of the oven...
... she got an e-mail.
What the damn hell?
"Bass player wanted."
That is what the ad said.<br/>Can you believe that?
After I'm the one<br/>who invited Darren into the band.
What am I gonna do?
You need to steal<br/>this douche-monkey's van...
...and then run my husband over with it.
While that's very tempting,<br/>I've never been the type of person to...
"Must be hotter than the girl we have now,<br/>who in my opinion is a 6 at best."
Jeez, what is this knucklehead doing?
Excuse me. Hey. You guys need a lift?
The best man just punched me in the face<br/>for no reason. You know what? I quit.
You can have your stupid band back.
Linus, whoever that best man is...
...I would like to buy him<br/>a double of your finest Scotch.
Louis.
Will you marry me?
Can you give me a minute?
Um...
- Okay.<br/>- There's someone that I need to talk to.
I'll be right back.
Hi, Max. It's me.
Sorry to interrupt.
I know you're probably up there<br/>playing baseball with your dad.
Um...
Look, I've got a situation here.
I think that I have been holding myself back<br/>from falling in love again.
And I think it's because I can't let you go.
But you're not here anymore...
...so I have to ask this.
Would it be okay if I moved on?
I realize that you have no way<br/>of answering that, but...
Okay. I will take that as a yes.
In that case, I should get back in there.
I guess this is it.
For real this time.
Bye, Max.
So?
My answer is...
...no.
You're in luck.<br/>Mother of the bride never checked in.
- How many keys will you need?<br/>- Just one.
I just... I broke up with someone.
- I think Room number 6 is the room for you.<br/>- Thank you.
Hold me close and hold me fast<br/>This magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
Kids, I must have heard your mom's<br/>rendition of "La Vie en Rose"...
... a million times over the years.
Every night when she tucked you in,<br/>for instance.
But that performance,<br/>that first night I ever heard her sing...
... that one will always be my favorite.
Barney, I was just out there on the patio.
And there's someone in the room<br/>next to us. I didn't see her...
...but she was playing the ukulele.
Barney?</div>]

[<div class="full-script">MAN: Well, that<br/>party was a dud.
MAN 2: I think I struck<br/>out with, like, 20 girls.
And... my condom expired.
We are losers!
- We've tried everything.<br/>- (sighs)
We're covered in Drakkar, I've<br/>got fresh new white socks,
and I thought our mime work<br/>in there was excellent!
What?
Um, are we in a zombie<br/>movie right now?
(hiccups)
(scoffs)
(sniffing)
Boys...
today is your lucky day.
Because today...
I'm gonna teach you how to...
(vomiting)
...live.
Who's got gum?
♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x17 ♪<br/>Sunrise<br/>Original Air Date on February 3, 2014
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<br/>@elder_man<br/>Resync for WEB-DL by Norther
NARRATOR: Kids, for a brief<br/>period when I was seven,
my best friend was a balloon.
It was the classic story:
boy meets balloon, boy and<br/>balloon become friends,
boy loses balloon when Mom sets<br/>out hot dogs in the backyard.
No!
NARRATOR: Decades later, boy's<br/>new best friend finds out
about the whole thing and<br/>never lets him live it down.
I hate you so much.
NARRATOR: The whole thing<br/>taught me a lesson.
If you love something,<br/>you can never let it go,
not even for a second,<br/>or it's gone forever.
Well, at least I still<br/>got my hot dogs.
No!
NARRATOR: It was a lesson that took<br/>me nearly 30 years to unlearn.
Where could Barney be?
Oh, relax. He always<br/>finds his way home.
St. Patrick's Day, 2008.
He did not find his<br/>way home that night.
That Dumpster was a block<br/>from his apartment.
- I call that a win.<br/>- (laughs)
Also, that isn't the filthiest<br/>trash he's ever slept with.
Ho! My future<br/>husband, folks!
(both laughing)
Or maybe he bailed<br/>on the wedding.
Oh, come on. Don't<br/>even think like that.
Well, he's terrified<br/>of commitment--
although, ironically,<br/>loves being tied down...
Look, as the run-offee at<br/>my own almost-wedding,
I can tell you you are fine.
- Barney is no Stella.<br/>- Mmm.
Hey, have you talked<br/>to her in a while?
- Stella?<br/>- Yeah.
The woman who broke my heart
and embarrassed me in front of<br/>all my friends and loved ones?
(laughing):<br/>Uh... no.
NARRATOR: That was a lie.<br/>A few days earlier,
I had talked to<br/>Stella on the phone.
Because, as you may recall, I'm<br/>kind of the wedding gift master.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you.
Do you not hear how<br/>weird this all sounds?
What part of this is weird?
You're going to your<br/>ex-girlfriend's wedding.
- It's not weird at all.<br/>- Where you'll be the best man...
Utterly not weird.
And now, less than<br/>a week before the wedding,
you're calling the woman<br/>who left you at the altar
and moved three time zones<br/>away on the razor-thin chance
that I somehow ended up with<br/>her grandmother's locket?
You know what's weird, Stella?
Not seeing Star Wars<br/> until you're 30.
You're trying to<br/>blow up the wedding.
You called C-3PO<br/>"the Tin Man."
- He is made of tin!<br/>- It's Tatooine scrap metal!
This is not an argument<br/>you are gonna win.
Now, do you have<br/>the locket or not?
Look, I might have it somewhere in one<br/>of my old boxes in our storage locker,
but even if I did, I cannot get out<br/>there this week. I'm totally swamped.
One ticket to Los<br/>Angeles, please.
MARSHALL: So the reason someone can't<br/>come up to fix the air conditioning is
that the ghost of<br/>Captain Dearduff,
who haunts this room,<br/>likes it muggy?
That's correct. Although,<br/>now that I say it out loud,
it does sound kind of ridiculous, because<br/>there's no such thing as ghosts.
Right?
You have outflanked<br/>me, Front Desk Guy!
Victory is yours!
NARRATOR: The truth is, there<br/>was a ghost in that room.
You see, minutes earlier,
Marshall had been in the middle of<br/>the worst fight of his marriage,
when all of sudden,<br/>Lily stormed out.
Damn it, Lily.<br/>This is so unfair.
I know! Storming out in the<br/>middle of an argument?
So childish!
Thank you, Ghost Lily.
I'm glad at least you<br/>see it that way.
Although, let's be honest,<br/>I did you a favor.
You were gonna lose.
I... what?
I was gonna lose? Uh, check your<br/>spectral scorecard, Ghost Lily.
I had you on the ropes.<br/>That's why you ran out.
I ran out because you<br/>brought up San Francisco.
- It was a valid point.<br/>- It's ancient history.
If you're mad at anyone,<br/>you're mad at 2006 Lily.
Well, I can't very well have<br/>an argument with 2006...
(à la Borat):<br/>Is nice!
(normal voice):<br/>Do people still say that?
I'm sorry, how exactly are you<br/>gonna teach us how to live?
The journey to awesome<br/>starts with a single...
Actually, lots of singles.<br/>We're going to a strip club.
- (laughs)<br/>- Strip club?
We're in the middle<br/>of nowhere.
There is always a strip club.
Hey, are you a little worried<br/>this guy might kill us?
We just put a down payment<br/>on adult bunk beds.
Would getting killed<br/>really be so bad?
Good point. I got a weird feeling. I<br/>mean, there's something off about...
Whoa!
BARNEY: Question: why does this<br/>sign say "gentlemen's club"?
Answer: because The Crab Shed<br/>is a place for gentlemen.
A gentleman tips generously.
A gentleman uses the complimentary<br/>bathroom cologne...
(whispering):<br/>...but not too much.
Oh. This is important.
Your instinct may be to<br/>avoid the free buffet.
Your instinct is wrong.
Don't sleep on the<br/>meatballs, gentlemen.
They are exquisite!
Come on!
You know, I liked Stella.
Even though she broke your heart,<br/>I'd still put her in your top five.
Which are...?
- All right, number five, Stella.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Number four, Zoey.
- Number three, uh, the<br/>Slutty Pumpkin. - Ah.
Number two, Marshall, that time<br/>you guys pretended to be a couple
when Barney was trying<br/>to sell the apartment.
(both laugh)
And number one, Victoria.
- Well, you've given this some<br/>thought. - Well, we all have.
There's kind of a running<br/>e-mail chain about it.
But the pastry chef was<br/>the best. No question.
I do miss her sticky buns.
Uh, euphemism?
- Nope.<br/>- (laughs)
Can I be honest?
Um, it was kind of crazy how<br/>all of sudden it was just...
over between you<br/>and Victoria.
I mean...
you guys were seven<br/>years in the making.
She left her fiancé<br/>for you. What...
why would you break up?
What happened?
(clears throat)
We, um...
we broke up because of you.
Oh, my God, this is amazing!
I ruined my pants, but<br/>it's totally worth it!
Best meatballs ever!
- Mmm! - I'm gonna ask<br/>a serious question right now.
Can a person live<br/>in a strip club?
Yes.
For the next few years, your<br/>strip club will be like home.
Then, one day,<br/>you'll date a stripper
and almost marry<br/>her, and after that,
you'll realize you're<br/>done with strip clubs.
In the sense that you'll dial it<br/>back to, like, once a week.
- I feel like I can talk to<br/>women now. - Yeah.
You just stick a dollar bill in your<br/>mouth, and the conversation starts itself.
You know, I think we're ready to go back<br/>to that party and meet some ladies.
(laughs) Yeah!
- Yeah!<br/>- Yeah!
You! Are! Not! Ready!
Your training is complete when I<br/>say your training is complete!
Come on, let's go.
You-you broke up with<br/>Victoria because of me?
She didn't want us to be friends<br/>anymore, so I had to let her go.
Ted...
I just...
Wow, I...
And-and you haven't<br/>talked to her since?
Haven't talked to her since.
NARRATOR:<br/>Also a lie.
Unbelievable.
And I assume this is all in<br/>the hopes that Robin'll ditch
her own wedding and<br/>run off with you?
What? No.
- I would never. - You would never run<br/>off with a girl on the day of her wedding?
Ri...
- Okay, that's a fair point.<br/>- I'm not done.
...Ight.
So, do you have it?
I'm looking at it right now.
What? Oh, uh... stay there.<br/>I'm-I'm on my way.
I'm in Germany.
Danke schon!
I see.
Look, if it means<br/>that much to you,
as soon as I'm done here at the<br/>bakery, I'll overnight it.
It'll be there in 24 hours.
(exhales)
Thank you.
So this bakery,<br/>what kind of, uh...
You want me to send you some<br/>chocolate truffle streuselkuchen?
Yes, please, you're<br/>the best, thank you.
NARRATOR:<br/>But then, 24 hours later...
disaster.
MAN:<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Mosby.
It says here your package<br/>was delivered earlier today.
- Your wife signed for it.<br/>- My... what?
I... I don't have a wife.
So, then, who's<br/>Jeanette Mosby?
Oh, you're kidding me.
Oh, my gosh, 2013 me!
So many questions!
How many MySpace<br/>friends do I have now?
Has James Blunt put<br/>out the steady stream
of number one hits we<br/>all expect from him?
And why are we in<br/>this hotel room?
We're here for<br/>Barney's wedding.
Barney's wedding? Oh, God.
What desperate ho-bag is handcuffing<br/>herself to that time bomb?
My dad did a real<br/>number on me.
Okay, uh... Ghost Lily,<br/>seven-years-ago Ghost Lily,
can we get on with this<br/>so I can win the argument
and we can move on to my<br/>regularly scheduled fantasy
of you two making out<br/>with each other?
- Sure. - Just so you know,<br/>I really like it when...
I know. I'm you.
And I don't like<br/>that anymore.
MARSHALL: Okay, yes,<br/>seven-years-ago Lily,
maybe I am wrong for still<br/>being mad at you about
San Francisco and<br/>our breakup.
But the truth is,<br/>when you left me,
that was the saddest I've<br/>ever been in my life.
Really?
The saddest you've ever<br/>been in your life?
Saddest I've ever<br/>been in my life.
I mean, I am<br/>sitting right here.
Look, Dad, yes, obviously,<br/>losing you was way worse, but
I'm trying to make a<br/>bigger point here.
And what point is that?
Because she hurt you once,<br/>you now get to hurt her?
It's not how it works<br/>in a marriage.
ALL:<br/>Ooh...
You're totally gonna lose.
I can't believe you're<br/>open at this hour.
I'm always open<br/>for my friends.
What are we doing here?
We should go back<br/>to the party.
In relaxed-fit<br/>domestic denim?
I'm sorry, is this a costume<br/>party, and you're going as 1994?
Would you be a peach<br/>and bump this, please?
Who cares about any of this?<br/>They're just clothes.
Just clothes? Ted--
sorry, force of habit--<br/>boys, suits are cool.
Exhibit A.
I don't care how<br/>well-dressed I am.
The real challenge is walking up to<br/>a girl that I've never met before
and somehow talking to her<br/>with words from my mouth.
I've looked at it from every possible<br/>angle. There's just no way to do it.
(both chuckle)
What's your name?
Justin.
Have you met Justin?
Uh, no. Hi, I'm Julie.
So simple, so elegant.
- Hmm.<br/>- That's it?
You just walk up to someone you don't<br/>know and introduce them to your buddy?
- I don't know. That sounds kind of...<br/>- Have you met Kyle?
Hi, Kyle.
Are you Jesus?!
I would have understood,
you know?
I mean, if you told me that we<br/>couldn't be friends anymore,
I-I wouldn't have liked it, but<br/>I, God, I would have understood.
I could never do that.
Why not?
Ted,
okay, I insist that<br/>you tell me why not.
No way.
Answer the question.<br/>It's... it's for the bride.
I'm not gonna answer<br/>the question,
because you know the answer.
You want to talk about my top five?<br/>There's no top five, Robin!
There's just a top<br/>one, and it's you.
And the only reason I'm saying<br/>any of this is 'cause
I know that it's not<br/>gonna change anything.
You and Barney are<br/>getting married today.
If I have to hold the shotgun<br/>myself, it's happening.
I thought you<br/>don't like guns.
I'm the best man.
I swore on the Bro Code.
I don't want to<br/>go to Bro Hell.
Bro Hell sounds bad.
I'm sure Barney's got a<br/>whole thing about Bro Hell.
But what about when we...
get back from<br/>our honeymoon?
What about our first night out<br/>at the bar? But what then?
I mean, is it gonna be weird?
No.
How can you be so sure?
Because I'm not<br/>gonna be there.
I'm moving to Chicago.
- You're moving to Chicago?<br/>- That's right.
- I'm gonna work for Hammond Druthers.<br/>- The penis-building guy?
They're not all<br/>penis buildings.
They just designed this clamshell<br/>amphitheater for the St. Louis Symphony.
That one, it doesn't look<br/>like a penis, anyway.
I can't believe you're<br/>leaving New York.
Wait, is this be-- is<br/>this because of me?
No, it's not because of you.
Well, maybe at first<br/>it was, but...
(sighs)
(grunts)
It's been a really long week.
Some stuff has<br/>happened and...
it's just made me feel like<br/>it's, it's time to move on.
Yes, good things happened<br/>to me in New York, but
bad things happened, too.
Like your top five<br/>worst relationships?
Okay, come on.
Let me hear it.
- Number five, Blah Blah.<br/>- Mm-hmm.
Number four,<br/>boats, boats, boats.
- Number three, Karen.<br/>- Mm.
Number two, uh, Zoey.<br/>She made both lists.
Number one, by a<br/>landslide, Jeanette.
- Jeanette, of course. - By the way,<br/>have you talked to Jeanette lately?
- I haven't talked to her.<br/>- NARRATOR: Liar.
So I was at your apartment<br/>stealing your mail,
and apparently there's<br/>some chick named Victoria
sending you jewelry<br/>from Germany?
Somebody owes somebody<br/>an explanation.
Jeanette, that locket is a<br/>wedding gift for Robin.
Robin?! Oh, God, this again?
That I'm giving to<br/>her as a friend
because I'm kind of the<br/>wedding gift master!
Now bring it back<br/>to me right now!
Fine. Meet me at the Bow Bridge<br/>in Central Park in one hour.
And by the way, I<br/>want Kenny back.
- Who's Kenny?!<br/>- My pet tarantula.
(gasps)
By the way, I love your hair.
- I love your hair!<br/>- Imaginary women, right?
I need everyone to<br/>just be quiet, please.
Look, I know that I could have<br/>handled all of this better.
But setting aside the fact that<br/>all of our friends are here
and that we don't<br/>speak Italian,
if we stay in New York, we<br/>both get to follow our dreams.
Are we really gonna go someplace where<br/>only one of us gets to do that?
- Of course not.<br/>- Well, then how can you...?
Wait-- what?
We're not moving to Italy.
We have a baby. It makes sense<br/>to stay here. Even I know that.
You do?
So...
I win?
Well, then, ho, hey, ho.
In your ethereal<br/>face, Ghost Lily.
Oh, yeah, the<br/>Convincer right here!
- She thought I was gonna lose.<br/>- You are gonna lose.
You're gonna lose this.
If you keep lying to me, if you<br/>keep cutting me out of decisions,
if you keep using words<br/>like "winning" and "losing"
when you talk about<br/>our marriage.
It's not like it'll<br/>happen all at once,
but if you keep acting this<br/>way, little by little,
you're gonna lose me.
Is that what you want?
No, of course not.<br/>You're not my enemy.
You're my wife.
(à la Borat):<br/>My wife!
(normal voice): Right?<br/>No. Sorr... sorry.
We should probably head back.
Do you want to watch<br/>the sun come up?
Sure.
JEANETTE: Thanks for<br/>meeting me here.
I'm heading over to the East<br/>Side to stuff a dead squirrel
into a different ex-boyfriend's<br/>mailbox, so, you know, this made sense.
Of course.
So, can I have the locket?
- No.<br/>- What? Jeanette...
Ted, listen to me.<br/>You're being crazy.
- I'm being crazy?!<br/>- Yes!
How long have you been<br/>hung up on Robin?
Eight years?!
And you're still killing yourself to fetch<br/>dumb little trinkets for her. That's crazy!
That's more than crazy. I don't think<br/>there's a word for what that is!
Actually, there is a word<br/>for that. It's "love."
I'm in love with her, okay?
If you're looking for the word<br/>that means caring about someone
beyond all rationality<br/>and wanting them to have
everything they want, no matter how<br/>much it destroys you, it's love!
And when you love<br/>someone, you just, you...
you don't stop, ever.
Even when people roll their<br/>eyes or call you crazy.
Even then. Especially then!
You just-- you don't give up!<br/>Because if I could give up...
if I could just, you know,<br/>take the whole world's advice
and-and move on and find someone<br/>else, that wouldn't be love.
That would be...
that would be some other<br/>disposable thing
that is not worth<br/>fighting for.
But I-- that is<br/>not what this is.
So, please, can I<br/>have the locket?
Cuckoo.
I think we should<br/>get back together.
ROBIN:<br/>And... new day.
Yep,
new day.

BARNEY (slurring):<br/>A few final thoughts.
Don't get married<br/>until you're 30.
Play laser tag once a week.
Give at least as many<br/>high fives as you get.
Teacup pigs are lady magnets,
but very hard to care for.<br/>Not worth the effort.
The same goes for<br/>dogs and babies.
And most importantly,
whatever you do in this life,
it's not legendary
unless your friends<br/>are there to see it.
Good luck, boys.
Take care of the game for me.

- Whoa, sorry. Sorry.<br/>- Oh, my God.
You know there is gonna be<br/>champagne at this party?
I know, but we're gonna get there<br/>and it'll be...
...everyone congratulating you<br/>on your book, saying:
"This is a revelation.<br/>You're gonna end poverty in our time.
This is the greatest book<br/>anyone's ever written."
- You're the only one that says that.<br/>- Well, it's true.
So before I lose you<br/>to your adoring public...
...I just want to take a moment,<br/>you and I, to celebrate...
...the best year of our lives.
- Happy New Year.<br/>- Happy New Year.
TED:<br/>Mm.
- We go big tonight.<br/>- Easy there, buddy.
We're old people, remember?
We haven't gone<br/>medium-sized in forever.
And I cannot<br/>carry you home in this dress.
Sweetie, relax. I got this.
Yeah, right. I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be<br/>so hungover tomorrow.
I'm gonna be fine.<br/>I made a vow, remember?
TED:<br/>Kids, the story behind that vow...
... took place the morning of<br/>Barney and Robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking<br/>way too much the night before...
... this is all Uncle Barney remembers from<br/>the first two hours of his wedding day:
[GASPS]
[ROARS]
And that's it. Now, here's how the<br/>rest of us remember those two hours:
ROBIN:<br/>Found him.
You know, he looks better<br/>than I thought he would.
Rise and shine.
Up and at them, let's do this.
There's a gas leak.
The building's on fire.
Your shoes don't match your belt.
[GRUNTING]
[IN UNISON]<br/>Uh-oh.
Okay, I think my fianc?<br/>peed himself a little. Aw...
Tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say<br/>my husband peed himself a little.
- Don't worry, I spilled some iced tea on him.<br/>- Oh, thank God.
[WHISPERS]<br/>I didn't really spill some iced tea on him.
Oh, God, this is bad.
We're doing family wedding pictures<br/>at the lighthouse in two hours.
My father is paying for it.<br/>He'll kill him if he doesn't show up.
Come on, your dad's tough, but won't<br/>he understand an old-fashioned hangover?
My father's recipe for a Bloody Mary<br/>trades out tomato juice for wolf's blood.
ALL:<br/>Ooh.
Bloody Mary?<br/>Sounds more like a Bloody Scary.
I say again. Bloody Mary? Sounds...
[IN NORMAL VOICE]<br/>Uh, hold on, you guys are forgetting...
...Barney Stinson has a super power.
He can't take a bad photo.
[BARNEY GRUNTS]
Okay, here. Watch.
Guys, Barney may be dead.
That's it. We are all now seriously<br/>too old to keep doing this to ourselves.
I vow here and now that I shall<br/>never again get that drunk in my life.
TED:<br/>Yeah, he'd wind up breaking that vow.
And I will not break that vow, as sure as<br/>I will always have a full head of hair.
NEWS ANCHOR [ON TV]: In other elections<br/>today, in the race for New York State...
... Supreme Court, Judge Brad Morris...
Oh, oh! Just look at him. Oh, I would<br/>love to rub that down. Ahem. Sorry.
- Has increased his sizable lead<br/>over Judge Marshall Eriksen.
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful<br/>three weeks of my life.
And in other results,<br/>a surprise comeback.
We're ready to call the<br/>New York State Supreme Court race...
... for Judge Marshall Eriksen.
[ALL CHEERING]
We'll go to Judge Eriksen for<br/>a live statement in just a few minutes.
Come again for Judge Fudge?
- As your next commissioner...<br/>- State Supreme Court Judge.
...of Gotham City...<br/>- The State of New York.
...I vow to make Batman work harder.
I say shine that Bat-Signal<br/>even for small stuff...
...like, uh, shoveling snow...
...or like, uh, if a police horse<br/>dumps out in the park.
Okay, that will be all<br/>at this time, thank you.
- That's all.<br/>- Okay. Good night.
Never again. I vow it.
I'm more worried about taking vows<br/>with this pile of garbage in a few hours.
- What do we do?<br/>- You guys see the irony here?
The only person who could possibly<br/>get Barney back on his feet is Barney.
TED: See, over the years, we'd all come<br/>to experience something Barney called:
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
The most effective post-bender-head's-<br/>too-tender-ender from here to Denver.
- What's in it?<br/>- Glad you asked.
- Columbia University, 1941.<br/>- I take it back.
BARNEY:<br/>President Franklin D. Roosevelt...
... who is most famous<br/>for being a world-class drunk...
... commissioned a top-secret project:
Develop an elixir to cure<br/>the common hangover.
And what brilliant scientific mind<br/>did boozy old FDR...
...pick to head up this historic task?<br/>- My head hurts. Let's just speed this along.
You're clearly ripping off the story<br/>of the Manhattan Project...
...which was run by<br/>Dr. Robert Oppenheimer...
...so I'm gonna guess<br/>it was your distant relative...
...Barnert Stinsonheimer?
Somebody's read their history books.
The Too Many Manhattans Project<br/>hit a few snags at first.
The first batch exploded,<br/>which sounded kind of like this:
- Boom!<br/>- Oh, you suck.
Just let me finish.<br/>But the second batch...
... sadly also exploded.
- Boom!<br/>- Oh! Why are you here right now?
- Do you want to hear the story?<br/>- No. Please leave.
After some trial and error,<br/>Dr. Stinsonheimer...
... finally found the magic formula.
Hang on. Funyuns? Tantrum soda?
- Sure.<br/>- In 1941?
Sure. They haven't made new Tantrum<br/>since then, it lasts a while.
Anyway, the elixir was such a success...
... he was awarded the Bro-Bel Prize.<br/>True story.
- Boom!<br/>- Why?
- That time I was just messing with you.<br/>- Just give me the stupid drink.
[GRUNTS]
TED:<br/>And the craziest part was...
I feel better.
Over the years, each of us would discover<br/>that Barney's elixir actually worked.
- Like way better.<br/>- What's in this thing again?
Stinson family secret.
You told me most of<br/>the ingredients in your story.
- Just tell me the secret one.<br/>- Ha! I'll never tell you.
I'll take it with me to my grave.
Damn it, Barney, why are you always<br/>so selfish? We are trying to help you.
Okay, we have to get this leaky barf bag<br/>back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
We know what Barney would want to do.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Say cheese.<br/>ALL: Cheese.
No, we are not doing<br/>Weekend at Barney's.
But that's the dream.<br/>I can't believe I just said that.
- Someone suggest something useful.<br/>- Here's the plan.
Marshall, you and Ted go gather<br/>the ingredients we do know.
Robin, you wake up Barney long enough<br/>to find out the secret ingredient.
And I'll race down to the spa<br/>to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.
- Okay, let's do this.<br/>- Bitch...
...walk out that door<br/>and Zabka is my maid of honor.
Okay, let's start simple:<br/>Fresh ocean air.
- Come on, baby.<br/>BOTH: Come on, honey.
ROBIN: Come on, love. Yeah.<br/>- Baby.
All right, I'll get the elevator.
Oh, I should get some water.
[LILY &amp; ROBIN GRUNT]
Okay. So accidentally throwing Barney<br/>down the stairs did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step<br/>as we dragged him back up here.
So how do we wake him up long enough<br/>to tell us the final ingredient?
When my sister and I<br/>had trouble getting up for school...
...my dad had a few cute tricks.
[BEAR ROARING]
I'll do it! I swear to God I'll do it!
Your dad used to do this to you?
With a Cabbage Patch doll<br/>and ax, but same idea.
Trust me, I was never late<br/>for kindergarten again.
What? Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Ugh. I second Marshall's vow.<br/>I will never ever get that drunk again.
TED:<br/>Yeah, she would.
My baby boy's in college.<br/>Did you pack enough undies?
Yes, Mom. Shh.
Your father did a lot of puking<br/>in these hallowed halls...
...from binge studying. Saved it.
That reminds me, mister,<br/>no underage drinking.
No good comes from<br/>hanging out in bars and getting drunk.
But every story<br/>from your 20's starts in a bar.
- Listen to your mother.<br/>- Aw... What are we gonna do...
...without you in the house?
LILY:<br/>We got him out of the house. Drink up.
Mm. Whoo!
Oh, boy.
- You son of a bitch.<br/>- You son of a me.
All right, we got most of the ingredients<br/>on our list: Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.
I can't believe that mini-mart sold Tantrum.<br/>It's been discontinued for years.
- Uh, hey, ahem, will you toss me that bottle?<br/>- Yeah, we haven't done this forever.
Dude, you're a grown man,<br/>why are you throwing a Tantrum?
- Nice.<br/>- So awesome.
- So awesome.<br/>- Okay, there's one more item on the list...
...and it's an odd one.
- Grease?<br/>- Grease.
At the Farhampton Inn,<br/>we don't cook with grease.
Our menu is organic, farm-to-table,<br/>locally grown. No "grease."
Sir, I am from Minnesota...
...where every meal is cooked with grease<br/>and my father dubbed it:
"The tastiest eats in the whole<br/>gosh darn world," so...
And how is your father's health?
Point is, it tastes really good.<br/>Also, we need it to help a friend...
...recover from a hangover.<br/>- Wait a second...
...there's bacon right here.<br/>And where there's bacon...
...there's bacon grease.<br/>- Which we throw out.
We aren't making any more bacon today.
Not unless it all somehow gets eaten<br/>in the 10 minutes before breakfast is over.
No, no, no. Ted, do not give me that look.
A mountain of food, a ticking clock?<br/>Come on, you live for this stuff.
No, I'm not a wild animal.
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer,<br/>poised to become ajudge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you<br/>celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?
You eat one 8-pound block of fudge<br/>in 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
You're not marked for life, Big Fudge.
I'm out, okay? You eat the bacon.
You know I can't, I'm allergic.
Ted, I've been trying to tell you for years,<br/>your bacon allergy is a lie...
...your mother made up<br/>so you'd eat healthy.
No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff.
Bacon, donuts, Halloween candy...
...not saying "thank you."
Oh, my God, that bitch lied to me.
Okay, I'll do it.
But, look, I don't even know<br/>if I'll like bacon.
[SNIFFS]
What do you think?
I have seen the face of God.
Okay, there is one thing<br/>we haven't tried yet:
Making out with each other.
- You really think that will wake him up?<br/>- Wake up who now?
[BARNEY GRUNTING]
Ugh. Look at this soggy bag of snot.<br/>That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow.
I am never, ever<br/>getting that drunk again.
TED:<br/>Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Look, let's just agree:<br/>Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
[BABY CRYING]
- Oh...<br/>- Ha-ha-ha. Every time. You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
Come here. Yeah, I know, I know.
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.
- Hey, Barney?<br/>- Yeah?
Whose baby is this?
[IN SPANISH]
[ALL SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
[BABY CRYING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
How could you, Mom?
You had the map to heaven<br/>and you never showed me the way.
May you rot in the bacon-less hell<br/>that I've lived in my entire life.
- They crisp it up real nice here, don't they?<br/>- Mm-hm.
What is that? Applewood smoked?
Ted, you've been going at it real hard...
...why don't you take a breather<br/>and I'll drive us home?
[SNARLS]
- Well, congratulations. Here's your grease.<br/>TED: Mm.
- No. I don't want to lose a finger.<br/>TED: Mm. Mm.
- Here.<br/>- All right, Ted, let's go.
No. No.
I finally found the one, Marshall.<br/>Her name is Bacon.
You know, this would go great<br/>on one of my mom's LT sandwiches.
- Okay, buddy, you gotta take it easy.<br/>- Never!
I've got a lifetime<br/>without bacon to make up for.
I will keep eating and eating and eating...<br/>Oh, God, help me, I'm going down.
TED: And that's the first<br/>and last time I ever ate bacon.
He's not waking up. I'm out of ideas.<br/>We've tried everything.
Not everything.
Lily Aldrin, let's make out.
[GASPS]
- Are you sure?<br/>- Yeah, baby. I'm sure.
Um...
Okay, well, you know what? I mean...
...it probably won't even work.<br/>It's stupid, I'm stupid.
Shh, shh, shh.
You're beautiful.
Come here.
[BARNEY GASPS]
More, more, more.
Whoa, he's awake. How'd you do it?
- Nothing special.<br/>- Hydration, patience.
Quick, before he passes out again.<br/>Barney...
...what's the secret ingredient<br/>in Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir?
Come on, stay with us.
The secret ingredient is...
...nothing.<br/>ALL: Huh?
I ate too much bacon.
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir...
...is a lie. That's the secret.
You know, I could use<br/>a little lie-down myself.
So Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir<br/>is a lie?
- Why would you lie about that?<br/>- Just to mess with us?
Like that jerk in high school<br/>who brings fake mushrooms...
...to see who's gullible enough to trip?<br/>- Damn you, OIlie Gunderson.
I knew those shrooms<br/>tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
- How do you know what they taste like?<br/>- My older brothers are not...
...the best people.<br/>- Why did you lie?
I love you guys.
He loves us?
- Let's throw him down the stairs again.<br/>TED &amp; MARSHALL: Yeah.
Wait, think. The first time<br/>Barney gave us that drink...
...those hangovers all happened<br/>at the worst possible moments.
Remember? Marshall thought<br/>he botched the bar exam...
... so he freaked out and got wasted?
Now I'm gonna miss the last day<br/>of the bar. I'll never be a lawyer.
I should just go back to<br/>being a manager at Structure.
That "10 percent off all vests" sale?<br/>That was my idea.
As was cutting the arms off the shirts<br/>that weren't selling. That's where I belong.
No, Marshall, you're gonna be a lawyer.
- Ugh. No, I can't do it.<br/>- Yes, you can.
Your first day back, live on the air,<br/>is gonna be legen... Wait for it.
- Dary. Your kindergarten field trip to the<br/>Jackhammer and Siren Museum today...
...is gonna be legendary.
No, it's not.
Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again,<br/>I'm never gonna recover from this.
- It's just a hangover, Ted.<br/>- Not that.
I got left at the altar, Barney.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this. You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the Stinson's<br/>Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all...
...believe that we could rally.<br/>Even though it's fake, it worked.
- Like Dumbo's feather.<br/>- Dum-bro's feather.
- A placebo.<br/>- Place-bro.
A sugar pill.
[GRUNTS]
He lied so we'd be okay.
Barney does love us.
I wish we could help him out<br/>the way he helped us.
- But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.<br/>- My dad's gonna be so pissed.
Yep, Barney's a dead man.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
Barney, you were always a bit...
...chatty and blond for my taste.<br/>You're like a woman.
But this new side of you...
...quiet, steady, I like it.
You've earned my respect today, son.
- I request the highest of fives.<br/>- Oh, no.
Stay cool, we got this.
[CHUCKLES]
BARNEY:<br/>I don't believe this.
You did Weekend at Barney's and it worked.
God, today's gonna be<br/>all downhill from here.
- That's what the bride wants to hear.<br/>- Ha, ha. No, that's not what I meant.
I just mean Weekend at Barney's<br/>is way more amazing...
...than our wedding could be.<br/>I'm gonna get more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos.
Well, he bought it.
We lied out of love.<br/>Look how happy he is.
He has no idea we had to<br/>cancel the photos...
...and my dad came up<br/>and kicked Barney in the crotch.
And the best part is,<br/>your dad has no idea.
He still loves me.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?
And some good came out of this,<br/>seeing you like that...
...we all vowed never<br/>to get that drunk again.
Well, actually, I didn't, but I will now.
- Never again.<br/>ALL: Never again.
TED:<br/>Kids, no matter how hard we try...
... even the best of us<br/>go a little too wild sometimes.
And in those moments, we all need<br/>someone who loves us to help us rally.
[GRUNTS]
[SIGHS]
- [WHISPERS] Happy New Year.<br/>- Okay, that was way too loud.
You're practically screaming.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What you need<br/>is Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
TED:<br/>Even if that means lying once in a while.
- Does it work?<br/>- Totally works.
[GAGS]
It's normal. It's totally normal.
- I love you so much.<br/>- I love you too.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Oop, oop. Better drink it fast.
BOTH: Mommy!<br/>- Hey, look who it is! Get her!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Heh. I can't believe<br/>we kissed today. Weird. Heh.
I feel kind of bad<br/>that Ted and Marshall missed it.
Hey, we should kiss one more time<br/>in front of them...
...just to, like, blow their minds, right?
- No, I don't think so.<br/>- Exactly. Totally. Ha, ha.
"Ha, ha, guys, you don't get to<br/>see this kiss either." Ha-ha-ha.
So where should we go?
Closet? Patio? Ooh, I think the sauna's open.
Well, actually...
...to be honest,<br/>it felt kind of weird to me.
- Once was enough.<br/>- Totally.
We could kiss, we could not kiss.
We could kiss, doesn't matter to me.
It's stupid. I'm stupid.
So stupid.

[<div class="full-script">TRACY:<br/>Thank you for bringing me here.
I am so glad we made it.<br/>That snowstorm was getting really bad.
You think this is a snowstorm?
This is nothing.<br/>I'll tell you about a snowstorm.
Winter break,<br/>freshman year of college.
Marshall and I were roommates<br/>but we weren't friends...
- Stop. You've told me this before.<br/>- I have? When?
- Uh, let's see, it was all the time.<br/>- Really?
You and Marshall drove back to school,<br/>"500 Miles" played on a loop.
Took a back road,<br/>ran out of gas.
Got stuck in a snowstorm, spooned<br/>to stay warm... At least, that's your story.
At the end, you were best friends.
Okay, okay, that's fine.<br/>Because guess what.
That wasn't even the worst snowstorm ever.<br/>It was 2008, Barney and l...
TRACY: Took over the bar, met the Arizona Tech<br/>marching band... Go Hens.
They played "Auld Lang Syne" when<br/>Marshall picked up Lily at the airport.
Okay, have I told you about<br/>the time that Marshall...?
TRACY: Tried to put Christmas lights<br/>on Lily's grandparents'house...
... and the ragamuffin from next door<br/>left him stranded on the roof.
- Did Lily tell you that one?<br/>- Yeah.
Lily used the word "ragamuffin."
- So I've told you all my stories.<br/>- I'm afraid so.
Luckily, I have plenty of stories<br/>that you don't know yet.
Like where my college roommates<br/>and I went to a male strip club...
Your friend Dongnose got smacked<br/>on the nose with a dong?
- I know that one.<br/>- Okay.
- What about the story that explains how...?<br/>- Dongnose got her nickname...
...and that it had nothing to do<br/>with the dong-smacking incident?
Heard it, loved it, called it the greatest<br/>coincidence of the 21st century.
Wow.
You know every one of my stories.
And you know every one of mine.
I guess it's official.
We're an old married couple.
- Nice.<br/>- We did it.
- Well, well, if it isn't the Mosbys.<br/>BOTH: Hi.
Here for a romantic weekend<br/>away from the kids.
Good thing there's no guest<br/>on either side of you.
Those bed springs are gonna squeak<br/>like mice in a cheese factory.
Ha, ha. Just don't break any lamps<br/>like your friends Barney and Robin.
- That's not how the lamp broke.<br/>- Of course not, have fun.
[TRACY CHUCKLES]
What lamp?
The lamp Robin broke<br/>the day of the wedding.
Oh, my God, you don't know this one.
Oh, man. This is a good one.
I mean, it's got everything:<br/>Intrigue, betrayal, lamps.
- It is a ripping yarn, buckle your seat belt...<br/>- Just tell the story.
Okay, here goes.
Robin broke a lamp.
- Okay, this has to stop.<br/>- Come on, we're just having fun.
It has been a long weekend.
This is how I relax.
Really? This is how you relax?
By not getting a single shot<br/>past me the entire morning?
You suck, Scherbatsky.<br/>You shoot like my grandma.
Okay, Scherbatsky,<br/>you just poked the dragon.
Here comes the bride.
Okay, how about we switch<br/>to an activity...
...that's more suited to somebody who's,<br/>you know, heh, getting married today?
Oh. We gonna go chug some Labatts?
I was thinking we could chug<br/>some memories, instead.
"Barney and Robin. Lovers Forever<br/>and Ever and Ever, A Love Story."
Sounds cheesy.<br/>I'm gonna go barf forever and ever and ever.
See you, hosers.
It's not cheesy.
[TINKER MUSIC PLAYING OVER BOOK]
See?
Uh, can you tell me the name of the guest<br/>staying in Room 9?
I'm sorry,<br/>that would violate hotel privacy policy.
Well, maybe my old friend Mr. Lincoln...
...can emancipate that information.
I'm so sorry, I wasn't clear.
I can't violate our hotel privacy policy...
...for five dollars.
- Something with a two on it is fine.<br/>- Those are rare, mine is lucky.
Just give me a 20, Mr. Mosby.
That room belongs to a Ms. Susan Tupp.
Oh, boy.
BARNEY:<br/>God, you're gorgeous.
I can't wait to be inside you.
Barney, get out here.<br/>This is your wedding day.
- Where is she?<br/>- Who?
Look, I just overpaid for some information<br/>about this room, so I know it's accurate.
- This room belongs to Susan Tupp.<br/>- Who?
Susan Tupp.
- Who?<br/>- Sue Tupp.
- Suit up.<br/>- I'm trying to.
I need you to help me pick the suit<br/>I'm gonna wear when I walk down the aisle.
Robin walks down the aisle.<br/>You wait at the end of it.
Okay, then the suit I'll be wearing<br/>when they all stand as I enter the chapel.
- That's also her.<br/>- Really?
Man, the fellas sure do get boned<br/>on the whole wedding thing, don't they?
Let's pick you a suit.<br/>What are the top contenders?
Well, after careful consideration...
...I've narrowed it down to these ones...
...and these ones...
...and the other ones in this room<br/>and all the ones in the adjoining room.
- You've narrowed it down to all your suits.<br/>- We're screwed.
This is a picture of the restaurant<br/>where you and Barney had your first date.
And now you're getting married.
And this is the receipt<br/>from the meal you and Barney ate...
...at that restaurant on your first date.
And now you're getting married.
- Can we look at this later?<br/>- Later? There is no later.
Robin, this is a day<br/>you only get to do once.
You need to appreciate the importance of it<br/>right now.
Oh, my God.
How did I only just now realize this?
Dude, this hotel has<br/>The Wedding Bride 2 on pay-per-view.
Score.
This is the best day of my life!
I know Robin's not the girliest girl,<br/>but you'd think on her wedding day...
...she'd be at least a little sentimental.
Everyone deals<br/>with getting married differently.
I got what I thought<br/>was the worst haircut.
- Until I fixed it with the actual worst haircut.<br/>- Which led to the worst wedding photos.
But at least you had<br/>a wedding day freak-out.
Don't worry, any minute,<br/>Robin's gonna get smacked in the face...
...with her holy-crap-this-is-my-wedding<br/>moment.
And she'll wedding out all over the place,<br/>I promise.
But you can't force it.<br/>It has to just happen.
I don't know,<br/>she bailed on my scrapbook...
...when she found out<br/>The Wedding Bride 2 is on pay-per-view.
The Wedding Bride 2 is on pay-per-view?
I'm sorry, did I hear you talking<br/>about The Wedding Bride?
- Oh, God.<br/>- Movie or the smash Broadway musical?
Smash? Oh, oh. Oh, I guess a show's<br/>a smash now if it closes after only 96 weeks.
My husband's ex-fianc?e's husband wrote<br/>the screenplay for The Wedding Bride.
- Jed Mosely was based on Ted.<br/>- Okay, Jed was not based on me.
Hey, that is not a toy, you ragamuffin.
That is an authentic flail I won<br/>at the renaissance faire.
Entirely.
But regardless,<br/>there's still some lingering pain there.
And as you can imagine, my friends<br/>promised me they'd never watch it.
Well, those are some good friends.
Oh, they're the best.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
My wiener.
I can't believe Jed made us promise<br/>not to watch this.
- You mean Ted?<br/>- Whatever, same guy.
[ALL LAUGHING]
See, I would have expected you to have<br/>a special suit just for this occasion.
I did. I had my boy Timmy G.<br/>Make the perfect wedding suit.
Ever heard of "bespoke"?
This suit was "be-freaking-screamed."
But I tried it on this morning,<br/>it was uncomfortable, itchy and wrong.
It was like a suit made for someone...
...with terrible posture,<br/>no taste and limited funds.
Here, you take it.
The question is, which of these<br/>other suits do I pick?
There are so many great ones<br/>to choose from.
- Well, how about this one?<br/>- Yes, yes, that's the one.
Oh, hey, quick question,<br/>is it weird to get married in a suit...
...that you may have worn<br/>while banging a female rodeo clown?
I know what you're wondering.
Yes, the carpet matched the drapes.
Of course that's weird,<br/>every part of it is.
Uh, what about this suit?
Ha, ha. Let's just say<br/>I stuffed a lot of bunnies in that suit.
- Do you have to phrase it that way?<br/>- Actual bunnies, Ted.
This is my magic suit.<br/>Get your mind out of the gutter.
Though I did once wear it<br/>to the Playboy holiday party and, uh...
...ha, ha, let's just say I stuffed<br/>a lot of bunnies in that suit.
Okay.
- Uh, how about this one?<br/>- Oh, man.
- I went crazy on an escort in that one.<br/>- Barney, come on.
A Ford Escort, Ted.<br/>I did it on a car.
With a woman who I may<br/>or may not have paid, that one's out too.
Okay, your wedding's in a few hours.
Kind of strange to spend those hours<br/>watching a terrible movie, right?
Terrible? Lily, this movie is a revelation.<br/>I can't believe Ted wouldn't let us see it.
Yeah, why was he hanging so much beef<br/>on this movie?
Just because there's a character<br/>based on him?
Of course, I'll make all weddings illegal.
Then Stella can never be<br/>a wedding bride.
[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]
Ooh. No-can-l-do's-ville, baby doll.
It's like, relax, Ted.
It's no big deal.<br/>You should be flattered.
And now to celebrate with that piece<br/>of chocolate cake I've been saving.
What? Who ate my cake?
- Uh, what cake?<br/>- Narshall!
"Narshall"?
"Narshall." How dare they?
That is insulting and ridiculous<br/>and I am nothing like that character.
I'm gonna sue everyone involved<br/>with this film.
So you're gonna sue them<br/>on the grounds...
...that nothing like that cake thing<br/>ever happened?
If Ted didn't want me to eat it,<br/>he should've put a note on it.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Oh, hi, Grandma.<br/>- Robin, sweetheart.
I wanted you to have this.
It's me and your grandpa<br/>on our wedding day.
- Aw. That's so sweet.<br/>- See my bouquet?
- Mm.<br/>- Those wildflowers?
They were supposed to be hydrangeas<br/>but there was a mix-up at the florist.
I was so upset, your grandpa<br/>went behind the church...
...and picked those wildflowers for me.<br/>And now, he's buried...
Behind the same church<br/>surrounded by the same wildflowers.
Okay, Grandma,<br/>watching a movie, gotta go.
Every single holiday,<br/>that same dumb story.
Sorry, Grandma,<br/>not as touching as you think it is.
At the very same church.
Now, I wanna see if Jed can get<br/>his wiener unstuck from that thermos.
- Ha, ha.<br/>- No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.
I'm sorry, did you just turn off<br/>the bride's TV on her wedding day?
Oh. Oh, is this your wedding day?
Ha, ha. I'm sorry, I couldn't tell, you're acting<br/>like it's any other Sunday morning.
And it's not.
Lily, if you're waiting for me<br/>to suddenly turn into the wedding bride...
...just give up, that's just not me.<br/>LILY: Fine.
Maybe we should all just act<br/>like this wedding's no big deal.
Maybe I don't even feel<br/>like wearing my bridesmaid's dress.
Great. It's just a wedding.<br/>Who cares what people wear?
- Say yes to the suit!<br/>- I can't, I can't.
Great, because I actually brought<br/>a different dress I'd like to wear.
- Fine.<br/>- Oh, no.
- Maybe I'll go put it on right now.<br/>- Go right ahead.
- What?<br/>- I'm so sorry.
What? Why?
I know this story too.
- Really?<br/>- Mm-hm. Yeah.
Robin and Lily get in a big fight<br/>and a few minutes later...
...there's a knock...
Hello.
- I've told you this one before.<br/>- A few times.
Oh. I'm just a boring old man<br/>who won't stop spinning yarns.
Hey, I love your yarns.
I hope you never<br/>stop spinning them.
But?
You're the love of my life, pooh bear.
I just worry about you.
I don't want you to be the guy<br/>who lives in his stories.
Life only moves forward.
So, what happens next?<br/>With Lily and the wedding dress, I mean.
Well...
...she brought the dress so she and Marshall<br/>could get new wedding photos taken...
...because, in yet another story I know...
No.
What space would I have in my brain<br/>for other things if I didn't know all this?
Ah, probably just state birds or some crap.<br/>Heh.
So, uh, Lily wanted<br/>to borrow Robin's photographer.
That shouldn't be a problem.
"Shouldn't be a problem"?
Robin, of course it should be a problem.<br/>This is your wedding.
You can't let somebody<br/>borrow your photographer.
She's not serious.
I didn't bring the suit<br/>I wore to our wedding.
Yes, you did, it's in our room.<br/>Go put it on, we're doing this.
And Robin, since you don't seem to care,<br/>I think I'll be wearing this to the ceremony.
- Fine.<br/>- Fine.
Fine, there's a very simple solution here,<br/>we might as well just face it.
U.S. Marines have to get married in uniform,<br/>so I'll just go enlist.
Dude, we can enlist together.<br/>That's the dream.
- That's not...<br/>- I wonder if they let you pick bunkmates.
I hope they do.<br/>Although I might wanna request a single.
- You'll make friends.<br/>- Look, enough of this.
Tim made you this amazing suit.<br/>Put it on.
- It just feels weird.<br/>- That's because it's new.
It's a suit that's never been worn before.<br/>A suit you never dreamed you'd wear.
All of this suit's memories<br/>are still ahead of it.
Look, picture it:
- The ceremony.<br/>- When everyone stands up for me?
They do that for her.
They should.
- She's gonna look amazing.<br/>- You better believe it.
She walks down the aisle.
You say your vows.
You go to the reception.
You have your first dance.
And before you know it,<br/>just like magic, you realize...
...it's a perfect fit.
You're right, Ted.
This is the one.
Thanks.
So...
Belts.
Hey, Lil, nice dress.
Ugh. You two were made for each other.
Does no one care<br/>that I'm wearing this dress?
I care. Okay, now you're good.
Okay, look, I know this is your wedding,<br/>but this is a big moment for all of us.
This may be the last time we're all hanging<br/>out together for who knows how long.
I mean, tomorrow morning,<br/>Ted's leaving for Chicag...
- Oh, boy.<br/>- Lily.
Wait.
You already know.
You already know.<br/>You're married to Lily, which means...
She pocket-texted me<br/>while you were telling her.
So, everybody knows<br/>I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.
Lily's right.
We don't know the next time<br/>that we'll all be together.
TED:<br/>And then, I think, it hit all of us:
We didn't know the next time<br/>we'd be together.
This was it.
And it's funny.
In a moment like that, when what's really<br/>happening is too intense to deal with...
...sometimes it's best...
To leave it unspoken and just enjoy<br/>each other's company instead.
You know,<br/>I've been wanting to see this movie.
Yes, movie time.
So it's not bad luck for the bride<br/>to see the groom in his wedding suit?
I think it's fine. Nice tie.
Thanks, there was a cornflower blue one<br/>that I almost went with.
Oh. That would've brought out your eyes.
- You brought more than one tie, right?<br/>- I was trying to pack light.
Maybe the groomsmen<br/>should go get some food.
I don't want Ted<br/>to have to sit through this movie.
- I appreciate that, Narshall.<br/>- Really?
Aw, damn it.
- Sorry, I saw it on a plane.<br/>- So this is gonna be a thing now?
Yeah, it's gonna be a thing now, Narshall.<br/>Right, Narshall?
Dude, settle down, Swarley.
Yeah, Swarlize Theron, take it easy.
Man, this was supposed to be<br/>my special day.
Oh. Hey, we survived the storm.
- Narshall, did you do that?<br/>- Nope, wasn't me.
Then who was it?
[GORILLA GRUNTING]
[BOTH SHOUTING]
A gorilla!
So that really happened to Ted?
That is exactly what went down.
Chapter and verse.
- Out of ice.<br/>- I'll get it.
Oh, no, got it, sit down.
Plus, the, uh, vending machine's<br/>got a loose coil.
I'm gonna try to hip check my way<br/>into some free Tropical Skittles.
Your sister's not like most brides, is she?
She's a Scherbatsky.
She's not gonna lose her Timbits<br/>because she's getting married.
I guess some people just never have<br/>that holy-crap-this-is-my-wedding moment.
Mom?
TED:<br/>And that's the story.
Right down to the surprise ending.
Is it really such a surprise?
I mean, come on.
Of course she showed up. What mother<br/>is gonna miss her daughter's wedding?
Oh, hey.
No, come on.
It's okay, I'm fine.
I'm okay.
[SIGHS]
Did Barney really wear a scuba suit<br/>into the bar?
- I've told you that story a million times.<br/>- But where'd he get the scuba suit?
- Heh. He stole it.<br/>- What?
Yeah. I can't believe I forgot that.
He walked into this sporting goods store,<br/>tried on a scuba suit...
...walked right out the door.
He walked all the way home in it,<br/>like 20 blocks.
[BOTH CHUCKLING]
Guy in a scuba suit,<br/>just walking down Broadway.
- He should be in prison.<br/>- Well, yeah, for lots of reasons.
[BOB DYLAN'S "IF YOU SEE HER,<br/>SAY HELLO" PLAYING]
- The thief of the group was Lily.<br/>- No.
- Yes.<br/>- No.
- Oh, my God, Lily...<br/>- She stole my heart.
No. No. No. I'm telling you.<br/>Lily, from, like, uh... Well, from college...
She left here last early spring
Is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right
Though, things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her
Don't tell her it isn't so

[<div class="full-script">TED: It was the day of Barney<br/>and Robin's wedding...
... and a surprise guest had just arrived.
Mom, I can't believe... How did you get here?
- On a plane.<br/>- With your fear of flying?
What, did the plane drive here?
Ha, ha! I've made enormous strides<br/>since you last saw me, dear.
This is nice.
I don't love flying, I must admit.
I haven't been on a plane in years...
...but maybe this won't be such a bad...<br/>CAPTAIN: We are cleared for takeoff.
[SCREAMS]
We're all gonna die!
We're all gonna die! Aah!
During the flight, I'll admit...
...I had a few difficult moments.
But, you know, by the time we'd landed...
Here already? Well, I have to say...
...it wasn't so dreadful after all.
Oh, I do apologize<br/>if I caused any distress.
And, oh, I'm terribly sorry about the door.
I had no idea it would fly off like that.
Please, please, send me a bill,<br/>because I'd like to replace it.
I'll be taking the train home.
Well, it's official.<br/>I'm gonna be Judge Marshall Eriksen.
That is great.
Can you help me get a driver's license?
Uh, what?
Marshall, you, uh, don't sound too excited<br/>to become ajudge.
I feel kind of guilty about it. I know<br/>how badly Lily wanted to move to Italy.
Don't do this, bro. Classic mistake.
You won. Enjoy it.
Drink the blood of your vanquished enemy<br/>and move on.
- You're gonna be a great husband.<br/>- No, no, no, wait. He has a point.
You said yourself, it was her decision.
Lily chose to give up herjob and not move<br/>to Rome so you could be ajudge.
Yeah, but something seemed off.<br/>We had this big fight, and she stormed out.
When she came back,<br/>she had totally, like, changed her mind.
- Wait, what time was this?<br/>- A little after 3 a.m., Billy Zabka. Why?
Last night, I was doing<br/>some late night dirt biking.
Naturally. Continue.
And I ended up at that EZ Pick<br/>a few miles up the road. And, well...
That's odd.
[PEOPLE BOOING]
You saw Lily getting into someone's car?
- I wonder who it was.<br/>- What did the license plate say?
It said "Ahoy."
The Captain.
Lily's boss. He has a house out here.
Why was Lily getting into the Captain's car<br/>at 3 in the morning?
Guys...
...I hate to even say this...
...but do you think it's possible...
...that I could eat six of these saltines<br/>in under a minute?
Challenge accepted.
Well, I can't wait to meet this Barney.
I haven't met him already, have I?
They said after getting Tasered<br/>I might suffer from short-term memory loss.
Oh, you'd remember if you'd met Barney.
- Ha-ha-ha.<br/>- Why don't I see what he's doing right now.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Barney's phone.<br/>- Ted, where's Barney?
He's trying to eat six saltines<br/>in a minute.
- Well, his future mother-in-law is here.<br/>- Robin's mom is here.
- Really? That's great.<br/>- And she wants to meet him.
- She wants to meet you.<br/>- I'm in the middle of the saltine challenge.
He's in the middle<br/>of the saltine challenge.
As soon as I'm done, I'll pop on over.
As soon as he's done,<br/>he'll just pop right over.
All right. Goodbye.
- The saltine challenge? Now?<br/>LILY: Heh.
It's his wedding day.<br/>Guys do weird things on their wedding day.
Well, on my wedding day...
...Robin's father completely disappeared<br/>for about three hours.
He just said, "I've gotta go teach<br/>somebody some manners," and off he went.
And then three hours later...
...he emerged from the woods...
...with a dead elk slung<br/>across his shoulder.
And I didn't even know<br/>that there were elk in Bermuda.
But this Barney.
- He sounds like a fine young man.<br/>- Yes, he is.
Agh! We're going again.
- You okay?<br/>- Why did she get into the car?
- Why didn't she tell me?<br/>- Maybe it was a work thing.
No. She has a fight with me, goes to an<br/>EZ Pick, gets into the Captain's Mercedes...
...and three hours later,<br/>she doesn't want to go to Italy?
Think this means...?
The Captain moored his dinghy<br/>in Lily's lagoon? Definitely.
That's crazy.<br/>You'd never moor a dinghy in a lagoon.
In certain tidal conditions,<br/>if you had a protected inlet...
You know what? It doesn't matter.<br/>Today is Barney's wedding.
Let's just forget it.
Marshall, do you want to go over<br/>to the Captain's house right now...
...punch him in the face really fast,<br/>come back and do this wedding?
Would that be okay?
- Ranjit, get the car.<br/>- Getting the car.
Baby, I can't wait to meet your mom, but I<br/>gotta go on a little excursion with the boys.
What? Where are you going?
Me and the boys have to go<br/>teach someone some manners.
Are there any elk on Long Island?
[SINGING]<br/>My gallant housekeeping crew, good morning
Sir, good morning
I hope you are quite well
Quite well, and you, sir?
I am in reasonable health,<br/>and happy to meet you all once...
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Oh, bother it. I'll get it.
Ahoy, Marshall.
[GRUNTS]
Are you okay, Robin?
No, I'm not okay...
...because apparently<br/>I am marrying my dad in a few hours.
Oh, sweetie, no, I'm sure that's not true.
I mean, there's so much you don't know<br/>about your father.
There were so many other red flags<br/>in our marriage.
I mean, for instance, do you know<br/>that before he was engaged to me...
... he was engaged<br/>to marry an exotic dancer? Hello.
- Red flag.<br/>- Oh, Genevieve. Not good.
And, did you know that one time...
... to impress women, he dressed up<br/>like a Prussian aristocrat...
... had a painting of himself made,<br/>and posed next to it in an art gallery?
Can you imagine?
- That's a rough one.<br/>- Darling, darling, the list goes on.
He would always take<br/>his mother's side in arguments.
He never checked with me before making<br/>plans. And our rehearsal dinner? Oh, boy...
... did we have it out<br/>right before our rehearsal dinner.
Thank you, Linus.
For the first 10 years I knew him...
...I didn't even know<br/>what your father did for a living.
- Every time I used to ask him, he'd say...<br/>- Please.
Yes, that's exactly what he used to say.<br/>How'd you know that?
- Heck of ajab, Marshall. Well placed.<br/>MARSHALL: Captain...
...I know something happened<br/>between you and Lily last night.
What? No. Nothing happened.<br/>Captain's honor.
You can ask my fianc?e.
Fianc?e? What fianc?e?
- Captain, permission to clear things up?<br/>- Granted.
Me. We're engaged.
- It's "Boats! Boats! Boats!" Ted, look.<br/>- Yeah.
I mean, yeah,<br/>I know her from that commercial.
- Boats! Boats! Boats!<br/>- And only from that commercial.
No, you banged her. Remember?
Like a bunch of times.
You knocked boots, boots, boots.
Captain, what the hell<br/>happened here last night?
Well, it was just after four bells...
[PHONE RINGS]
- Ahoy?<br/>- Hi. I know it's late...
...but I've gotta get out of here.<br/>CAPTAIN: I sent the car. When she got here...
- Lily, what a lovely...<br/>- Can I use your powder room?
And then she went to the powder room.<br/>She was in there quite a while.
Probably a deuce. Go on.
And when she came out,<br/>she had to leave right away. It was odd.
But I assure you, nothing inappropriate<br/>happened between me and your wife.
Captain, I understand what you're saying,<br/>but what you don't understand...
...is that Lily is my wife...
...and I love her way too much<br/>to behave rationally now.
En garde!
This is the best day of my life.
Oh, darling. Come on. No, no,<br/>you're not marrying your father.
Your father...<br/>I mean, let's just put it this way.
Your father was a sociopath.
He slept with over 20 women.
And sure, you know,<br/>we were friends for years first...
...and it was entertaining<br/>watching him lie to those poor girls...
...to get inside their snow pants.
But I should've known back then<br/>this was not husband material.
I mean, even your Uncle Jim,<br/>you know, his gay black brother...
Will you shut up?
[PHONE RINGS]
Go for Barney.
Your bride is freaking the crap out<br/>right now. Where the hell are you?
I warn you, Captain.
I've pretended to have a duel<br/>with actual swords.
Twice.
I warn you, Marshall.<br/>I was on the Olympic fencing team.
Won three gold medals.
I warn you, Captain.
I'm starting to feel like this was a mistake.
I think I'd better not say where I am.
I am not kidding around here.<br/>Tell me where you are.
[SIGHS]
We're at the Captain's house.
What is it? What's wrong?
I am so busted.
Thank you, Linus.
You have another piece of gum?
LILY:<br/>I can keep a secret.
I can keep a secret real good.
- Are you chewing gum?<br/>- I can keep a secret like nobody's business.
Because it is nobody's business.
You never chew gum.<br/>You shouldn't chew gum.
Because it's a secret. And I'm keeping it.
- Wait. Stop the duel.<br/>- Oh, thank God.
- I mean, why?<br/>TED: Why?
Because I just solved the mystery,<br/>that's why.
Mosby Boys.
We agreed you wouldn't do that anymore.
Mystery? What mystery?
Lily has a secret.
She's hiding something...
...and I know what it is.
Okay. What is she hiding?
I'll tell you in a minute.
I want to enjoy the suspense<br/>a little bit first.
Ooh.
Oh, my God, will you just tell us?
Very well.
Now, we can all agree<br/>that this is the first time...
...I've ever set foot in this house, correct?
Oh, this is going to be unbearable.
Captain, your powder room.
Does it face out on the ocean?
- Of course. Right over the cliff.<br/>- Just as I suspected.
And if I were to walk<br/>into this powder room right now...
...I believe I'd see<br/>a potted plant of some sort.
- Is that correct?<br/>- Yes. There's a daisy.
A daisy.
Interesting.
Not traditionally an indoor plant...
...but I suppose it gets plenty of light<br/>with the southern exposure.
That's right. It does.
- Will you please fetch the daisy?<br/>- Aye-aye.
I totally solved it.
You didn't solve it.
You didn't solve it.
You didn't solve it. You didn't solve it.<br/>Did you solve...? No. You didn't solve it.
I solved it.
Thank you, Captain.
Now...
...a simple question.
When Lily and Marshall are apart<br/>for an extended period of time...
...what is the one thing Lily always does?
- Cry?<br/>- Masturbate?
- Karate?<br/>- Go sailing?
No.
When Lily and Marshall are apart...
...for a long period of time...
...Lily...
...always...
...starts smoking again.
That's true. She does.
Happened when she went<br/>to Paris in college.
It happened when she moved to San<br/>Francisco and last week, it happened again.
From the moment Marshall left<br/>for Minnesota...
... Lily's been secretly puffing ciggies...
... like a 46-year-old grandma<br/>at a Reno slot machine.
Problem was, come Friday morning...
... she knew she'd have to quit again.<br/>Cold turkey.
And it wouldn't be easy.
She tried to make it a whole car ride,<br/>but couldn't.
She pretended to be annoyed<br/>by perfectly reasonable things...
... like my driving gloves...
... and my appreciation<br/>of the historic Van Otterloop manse.
All so she could have<br/>one last smoke on the train.
But afterwards, her breath told the tale.
And that's why, when she got to the hotel...
... Lily...
... was chewing...
... gum.
- Lily never chews gum.<br/>- What, never?
- Well, hardly ever.<br/>- Great job, Ted.
That's some pretty solid evidence. Gum.
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, Barney, my dear boy...
...I'm just getting started.
Getting started?
TED: Lily knew that cigarette<br/>was her last for a while.
She needed something to keep her calm,<br/>so she headed to the bar.
Any time you see me<br/>without a drink in my hand...
...you put a drink in my hand.
Are you my guy, Linus?
TED: What followed<br/>was a long day-and-a-half for Lily.
A really long day-and-a-half.
It's kind of insane how much happened<br/>in just a day-and-a-half.
Anyway, Marshall returned...
... they had a big fight, Lily stormed out.
And that's when she realized...
... if she was gonna sneak one,<br/>this was her chance.
And after that fight, boy did she need one.
Only problem?
She was all out.
Now, it's 3 a.m.
You need a cigarette. The only place<br/>is an EZ Pick five miles down the road.
You have no car. What do you do? Go.
- Dirt bike it.<br/>- I can walk that far.
- Masturbate.<br/>- Take a boat.
What? A boat?
Dude, she got a ride in your car, remember?
[PHONE RINGS]
- Ahoy?<br/>- Hi. I know it's late...
...but I've gotta get out of here.<br/>I wanna make one stop first.
TED: The problem was, Lily didn't want<br/>to smoke in front of her new employer.
So when she arrived at the Captain's house,<br/>there was one possible course of action.
Can I use your powder room?
Now, you're Lily. You've just had a cigarette<br/>in your boss's powder room.
What do you do with the cigarette butt?<br/>The window? Flush it?
No, she wouldn't do either.<br/>She's an environmentalist.
- Your purse?<br/>- Marshall could find it.
- Throw it in the trash can?<br/>- The Captain would find it.
Hide it in a boat.
A boat? How would that even...?
I don't know. I just... I like boats.
No.
There's only one place<br/>that she would put it.
The place where, eventually,<br/>it would decompose...
...and serve as a natural mulch.
It's in the daisy.
And sure enough...
...if I dig around...
...I am all but guaranteed to find...
...a pregnancy test.
You could smoke those?
[RETCHING]
Oh, no.
- So, you want the Kennedy Package?<br/>- Bingo.
One other little thing.
When you do put a drink in my hand,<br/>let's make it non-alcoholic.
There's a chance I might be pregnant.
Okay, Linus, don't start popping<br/>the sparkling ciderjust yet.
I'm just being cautious.
I'll take a test when I get home. It can wait.
Are Marvin, and I...
...and any other future children<br/>we may have...
...just some consolation prize?
I have to get out of here.
It can't wait.
- Lily, what a lovely...<br/>- Can I use your powder room?
Two minutes. Here we go.
Guys, we need to go back to the hotel.
Lily peed on that, and you touched it.
Lily?
You're gonna have a baby?
I told you guys I could keep a secret.
Uh... Uh, Barney, this is my mom.
- Hi.<br/>- Hello.
Oh, he's a hugger. Nothing like your dad.
I'm sorry, I was gonna tell you tonight.
No. Oh, my God, no, it's fine.<br/>There's so much we have to do.
You know, we have...<br/>We have to do research on...
...hospitals in Italy, and we have to...<br/>- But we're not going to Italy.
Of course we are.
We have to do this.<br/>You're gonna live in Rome.
And you're gonna get your dream,<br/>because...
Because you're giving me mine.
Again.
But there's gonna be<br/>all sorts of paperwork...
...and if she's born outside of the U.S.<br/>She can never become president...
It's a girl?
Oh, I don't know.
But in my mind, I kind of think she is.
I love you so much.
We're gonna give you some privacy.
- It's my room. Why do I have to...?<br/>- Just come on.
- I thought this was an exit.<br/>- Nope. Balcony.
Well, we'll just give them a few minutes,<br/>and then we'll go back in and...
Oh!
They are both naked.
- Yeah, they work fast.<br/>- Yes.
Oh, darling.
Oh, you're going to be fine.
You know, for every marriage<br/>in the world like I had with your dad...
...you know, there's a marriage<br/>like those two in there.
Marriage, it's... Oh, it's terrifying.<br/>It's like flying.
You know, you're filled<br/>with this mortal dread.
But if you find someone you feel safe with,<br/>it's like flying.
But if you've got someone<br/>that you feel is really there for you...
...someone you can depend on...
...you're gonna be fine.
Do you have someone like that?
I do.

[<div class="full-script">TED: Hi.<br/>- Hi.
Okay.
So I thought we'd try this new<br/>restaurant around the corner.
It's Scottish-Mexican fusion.
- Scottish-Mexican fusion?<br/>- Scottish-Mexican fusion.
Those seem like two things<br/>that do not fuse.
Perhaps you'll change your mind<br/>when you try their signature haggis enchiladas.
- Ha, ha. Okay. Lead the way.<br/>- All right. Yeah. Come on.
I was surprised when you called.
Isn't there some universal guy rule<br/>to wait four days to call a girl?
That does not ring a bell.<br/>And it's three days.
[CHUCKLES]
Here we are.
[BAND PLAYING "MEXICAN HAT DANCE"]
Uh, I did not realize<br/>there would be live music.
So, uh, should we...?
- Eat anywhere but here? Yeah.<br/>- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'm sure we can find a place...<br/>- Yeah.
...where we don't need reservations.<br/>- You think it's easy?
Stroll in off the street and get a meal?
Well, let me tell you<br/>the tale of Gary Blauman.
There's the blushing bride.
- Oh.<br/>- Mwah.
Gary Blauman.
How are you? Oh, duh.
Like I need to ask. You're getting married.
Don't let me keep you. You have things to do.<br/>I'll see you walking down the aisle.
I'll be the guy in the eighth row<br/>going like this:
- Ha, ha. Right?<br/>ROBIN: Right.
- Ah, good luck today. Okay.<br/>- Thank you. Ha, ha.
- Hey, there's the blushing...<br/>- Code red!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br/>- Why the code red?
If it's about your hair, I didn't even notice.<br/>Especially not from the back.
- What?<br/>- Nothing.
Gary Blauman's here. I had no idea<br/>he was coming. His reply card got lost.
Where's he gonna sit?<br/>It took us weeks to plan the seating chart.
Robin.
Shh.
- I got you.<br/>- Huh?
You're talking to the seating-chart master.<br/>At my wedding, I managed to sit...
...small-town Minnesotans next to liberal<br/>New Yorkers with grace and aplomb.
Table 27 still gets together<br/>once a year for a reunion.
Perhaps you've seen their photos<br/>on Facebook?
- Like I said, I got you.<br/>- Thanks, Marshall.
[DOOR OPENS]
- Hey.<br/>- Code red!
Grandma sitting next to the band, divorced<br/>couples one table away from each other?
No coherent singles table?<br/>This is the Robin's hair of seating charts.
Singles tables are cruel. What if you went to<br/>a wedding with a table of fat guys?
- That'd be awesome.<br/>- It would.
Let's crack this Blauman nut,<br/>then work on the fat-guy table.
- Wait. Did you say "Gary Blauman"?<br/>- Yeah, why?
- I hate that guy.<br/>- Why?
Remember a few years ago I read that<br/>biography of Teddy Roosevelt?
For weeks after I read it,<br/>I only wanted to talk about one thing.
Teddy Roosevelt was the coolest guy ever.
[ALL GROAN]
That's it. No more books, Ted.
I don't like the person you become<br/>when you read.
Here's the deal: You get to tell us one more<br/>interesting fact about Teddy Roosevelt.
One more, and then you're done forever.<br/>So make it a good one.
Okay.
He went blind in one eye...
...from getting hit too hard<br/>in a boxing match...
...while he was president.
- Wow.<br/>- That's a pretty good one.
- Right? Oh, and when he was at Harvard...<br/>- Shut up!
- No!<br/>- Please!
TED: Well, one night, we were throwing a party<br/>to celebrate something...
... I can't remember what, when a pretty girl<br/>noticed the book on the table.
I can't believe you have this book.
I just finished reading it.<br/>Teddy Roosevelt was the coolest guy ever.
A unicorn.
TED:<br/>I couldn't believe it.
It was a stroke of luck on par with<br/>the 50-page manuscript in Roosevelt's pocket...
... that slowed<br/>that would-be assassin's bullet.
- Dude, come on.<br/>- Sorry. Anyway, enter Gary Blauman.
Is that the Teddy Roosevelt biography?<br/>Coolest guy ever.
- Right? Right?<br/>- Right? Right?
- Right? Right?<br/>- Right?
TED:<br/>The three of us started talking Teddy Roosevelt.
When he took that flight<br/>on the Wright brothers' plane?
So cool.
The time he climbed the tallest mountain<br/>in Europe on his honeymoon?
- So cool.<br/>- Uh...
TED: That's when I realized:<br/>Blauman and I were locked in a battle of wills...
... that made T.R.'s charge<br/>up San Juan Hill look like a walk in the park.
Or should I say, in the national park, since<br/>Roosevelt spearheaded the establishment...
Dude, come on. I gave you one.
The battle raged on.
In a way he was...
ALL: The archetype of the modern politician.<br/>Ha-ha-ha.
STEPH: Oh, my God.<br/>TED: Dude, knock it off.
GARY:<br/>Knock what off, bro?
TED: This is my apartment,<br/>my Teddy Roosevelt conversation. I get the girl.
GARY: Oh. So the fact that you're<br/>the incumbent means she should just pick you?
Tell that to William Howard Taft.
TED: You're calling me Taft?<br/>If anyone's Taft, you're Taft.
GARY:<br/>I'm not Taft. I'm Teddy.
TED:<br/>The hell you are. My name is Ted.
GARY: Yeah, right.<br/>Go sign the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, Taft.
TED:<br/>Ah! How dare you?
Skinny-dipping in the Potomac River.
[ALL LAUGH]
TED: And so the standoff continued.<br/>Hours passed. Then days.
- Days passed?<br/>- Days passed.
Finally, like T.R. Stricken by tropical fever<br/>on his Amazon trek, we could go no further.
When he was<br/>assistant secretary of the Navy...
Will you just pick one of us already<br/>so I can either have sex or go to sleep?
Smooth, bro.
After that day,<br/>I have never liked that guy.
So let's just tell Robin this can't be done<br/>and send Gary Blauman packing.
- Did you just say "Gary Blauman"?<br/>- Yeah.
I love that guy.
What? He's the devil.
He's an angel.
It was 2006. Marshall and I had broken up.<br/>I was back in New York, feeling vulnerable...
...and listening to my breakup song<br/>over and over.
- Sugar Ray's "Fly."<br/>- You know it.
- Man, you know nothing about breakups.<br/>- I really don't.
- Anyway, then I hit bottom.<br/>- There's a bottom below Sugar Ray?
Mm.
- What? Why have I never seen that before?<br/>- I've been using cover-up...
...and strategically placed straps<br/>for a long time to keep this puppy quiet.
After all the times you guys made fun of me<br/>for my breakup butterfly tattoo?
[BOTH SNICKER]
Oh, fact-that-Ted-got-a-butterfly-tattoo,<br/>will you ever stop being hilarious?
Why is it only half a butterfly?
Because Gary Blauman saw me<br/>in the tattoo parlor, dragged me out...
...and talked some sense into me.
Lily, trust me, you and Marshall<br/>are going to get back together.
And when you do, you'll be so glad<br/>you did not get the other half of that butterfly.
Actually, I was gonna get<br/>a little more than the butterfly.
It's good that I ran into you.
Marshall, Blauman saved you<br/>from a lifetime of looking at Sugar Ray...
...every time we do it on your birthday.<br/>Find him a nice seat.
No. No. Do not find him a seat.
You find him a nice...
TED:<br/>Neither of us was gonna back down.
So finally we decided<br/>to take it to the groom.
[GASPS]
- What's going on?<br/>- Shh.
Who's that guy?
It's my ex-boyfriend.
So we're crouching behind a van,<br/>hiding from your ex-boyfriend.
Forgive me... I'm a little bit of a detective.<br/>- But it was a bad breakup?
Pretty bad.
- Bad like there was a big fight?<br/>- Bad like there was a big ring.
Bad like this happened in the past year?
Bad like it happened Saturday.
- So bad.<br/>- Yeah.
Okay, he's gone.
I'm so sorry, Ted. I really like you.
But I'm in the weirdest place<br/>on Earth right now.
- You're in a Scottish-Mexican restaurant?<br/>- Ha, ha.
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
It's just too soon for me to be dating.<br/>I think I should head home.
Well, want me to walk with you? Lots of scary<br/>ex-boyfriends in this neighborhood.
Sure.
- I do want to hear the rest of that story.<br/>- Right, the story.
- Yeah.<br/>- So we decided to take it to the groom.
- Did you say "Gary Blauman"?<br/>- Yeah.
- Gary Blauman?<br/>- Yes.
Blauman, comma, Gary?
Point, comma, get to the damn.
I...
...Iove that we have the opportunity...
...to destroy Gary Blauman's weekend<br/>by kicking him out of the wedding!
Yes! Gary Blauman haters club, right here.
What that guy did to me...
...oh, God, it makes me furious to this day.
Okay, okay, I am going to try and tell this story<br/>without completely losing it.
Ready? Okay, here goes. I was at the...
[GROWLING]
- Nope, not gonna happen. Give me a second.<br/>TED &amp; MARSHALL: Oh!
I was at the bar.
- Hey, Barney.<br/>- What's up, Blauman? Have a seat.
Oh, thanks.
- Your fries. You need anything?<br/>- I'm good. Thanks.
Oh, but he was not "good, thanks."
He was not "good, thanks" at all.
Oh, what, did he take one of your fries?
"Take one"?
Take one?
It would've been one thing<br/>if he took one of my fries. One thing.
No, Lily...
...that day Blauman took...
[GRUNTS]
...four of my fries.
But that's not even the capper.
Here's the part<br/>that still keeps me up at night.
The fourth fry he took...
The fourth fry he took...
[SPUTTERING]
Buddy. Buddy, you okay?
Mm, mm. Mm.
The fourth fry he took...
...was an accidental curly.<br/>TED &amp; MARSHALL: Ah!
You don't take a man's accidental curly.
You take a man's wife<br/>before you take his accidental curly.
If you wanted curly fries so bad,<br/>why not just order them in the first place?
Yeah, because that's what you want,<br/>all curly fries.
Regular-cut with a few accidental curlies.<br/>That's what you want.
- That's the dream.<br/>- He's right. That is the dream.
No! I refuse to look down from the altar...
...as I say my vows<br/>to the woman of my dreams...
...and see that damned stupid<br/>accidental-curly-fry-stealing Gary Blauman.
Did you say "Gary Blauman"? I...
...hate to disagree with Barney,<br/>but I love that guy.
I just met him earlier today.
- Oh, my gosh. It's you.<br/>- Yeah.
You're the poet William Zabka.
Nobody ever recognizes me<br/>for my poetry.
He has all six of my collections.
When Terry Gross interviewed me<br/>on Fresh Air, he listened live.
Gary Blauman rules.
Gary Blauman?
I...
...hate...
...that I once thought I loved Gary Blauman.<br/>- Ooh, this sounds good.
Gary's the guy that I had an affair with.
Tom found out, threw me out of the house...
...and now the kids are from a broken home.
Because of Gary Blauman,<br/>everything that matters to me is gone.
I got that beat. So I was ordering fries...
Wait, wait, wait. Blauman's gay?
Then that means that night, the real battle...
...was between Blauman and the girl.
And the prize was this guy.
- Figured something out.<br/>- Keep telling yourself that.
- I don't want Gary at my brother's wedding.<br/>- Neither do I. I'm the brother in question.
[ALL SHOUTING]
- It's your wedding.<br/>- Order! Order!
Robin put this on my plate, so I'll make<br/>the decision. Now, let's take a short recess.
Everybody out.
Lily. Out-of-court settlement. Drop this<br/>whole thing and I'll give you 10 bucks.
No.
I can't go higher than 10.
[MARSHALL CLEARS THROAT]
I'm ready to give my decision.
This was a tough one.<br/>Good points on both sides...
...but ultimately, Blauman stays.
- What in the...?<br/>- For one simple reason.
There is a higher law at every wedding,<br/>a law that trumps all other arguments.
When the bride asks for something,<br/>she gets it.
Yes.
BILLY: Good point.<br/>- Wow. He's right.
This fake court thingy is adjourned.<br/>Judged.
I guess let's go find Blauman<br/>and tell him the good news.
Yeah, about that, bit of a wrinkle.<br/>I was just in the hallway, ran into Blauman.
Told him if he didn't leave immediately,<br/>Zabka was gonna crane-kick him in the face.
What? But that's not even my move.
- We have to stop him.<br/>- Barney.
- Ahh.<br/>- Come on, come on.
So we all run out to the parking lot to stop<br/>Gary Blauman from leaving the wedding...
What are you doing?
This is my place.
TED:<br/>Oh.
So, uh, well,<br/>I guess this is where I leave you.
This is your place.
Yep.
- You sure it's not a few blocks that way?<br/>- Nope, it's right here.
It's right where you picked me up.
So it is.
- Well, good night.<br/>- Good night.
TED: Eight years earlier, I would've given some<br/>speech, confessed my love, scared her off.
But I didn't. Because somehow<br/>I just knew this was all gonna work out.
- Ted?<br/>- Oh, thank God.
Do you at least wanna finish your story?
Right.
So we all ran out to the parking lot and...
Blauman. Blauman. I'm sorry. You can stay.<br/>Billy won't kick you in the face.
It's not even my move.<br/>If I was gonna do anything...
...I'd sweep the leg<br/>and put you in a body bag.
What, is that from one of your poems?
Thank you for that.
Please stick around. For the bride.
You're not a Taft.<br/>Roosevelt shouldn't have divided the party.
- He handed the election to Wilson. Right?<br/>- Completely, right?
No. Wait, no. All right? Forget it.
And, James, I'm sorry about you and Tom...
...but you have to stop blaming me<br/>for your own decisions.
Well, guys, take a good look.
This face? You won't be seeing again.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- The br... The br...<br/>- Yeah, Gary.
He's really leaving.
Hey, Barney.
Do you still have my wedding ring?
Yeah.
I've got some work to do. Excuse me.
Blauman will cool off. We'll see him again.
- Of course we will.<br/>MARSHALL: I don't know.
We might really never see him again.
Because I remember at our wedding,<br/>looking out and thinking:
"Man, everyone here<br/>means so much to me."
A bunch of those people, you know,<br/>I haven't seen them since.
TED:<br/>And that's how it goes, kids.
The friends, neighbors, drinking buddies,<br/>and partners in crime...
... you love so much when you're young...
... as the years go by, you just lose touch.
That being said,<br/>I did manage to keep track of a few people.
Carl's still behind the bar at MacLaren's.
Hey, watch it over there.
Yeah, watch it over there.
TED:<br/>It's become a family business.
Jeanette was arrested for mailing<br/>jars of urine to Val Kilmer.
No, not that Val Kilmer.<br/>She narrowly avoided prison time...
... but did receive mandatory<br/>psychological counseling.
Hello, handsome.
I should say up front, I'm not allowed<br/>to date my... Oh, what the hell.
TED:<br/>She and Kevin live in Poughkeepsie now.
Ranjit made a couple really good stock picks,<br/>and, well, he owns the limo service now.
Bitterman, get the car.
Getting the car, sir.
Patrice has her own drive time radio show.<br/>People call in, she gives advice.
WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: Sometimes I just feel<br/>like he never listens to me.
Gosh, caller, that's a real pickle.<br/>You know, my grandma always says...
WOMAN:<br/>Damn it, Patrice, I'm not finished!
Sorry, sorry, go on.
TED:<br/>William Zabka became the youngest poet ever...
... to win the<br/>American Humanities Medal for Literature.
He's currently working<br/>on a collection of travel essays.

TED: Zoey pops up on the news every now<br/>and then, supporting some cause or another.
It doesn't always go well for her.
The hawk is a majestic creature.<br/>She means you no...
[HAWK SCREAMS]
Aah! No, I'm your friend. I'm helping you.
TED: Still, it's nice knowing she's out there<br/>fighting the good fight.
Scooter's been married for a while.
He met a girl at work,<br/>and it was love at first sight.
I guess something about her<br/>helped him get over Lily.
You look beautiful today, Jasmine.<br/>Like every day.
- Move. I serve sloppy joe now.<br/>- Okay.
TED: Blitz struggled with a gambling addiction<br/>for a while...
... but after a three-day bender<br/>on the same slot machine, he finally kicked it.
I gotta get help.
- Learned to live a life of style
Yes!
[SIREN BLARES]
- Whoo!<br/>- Oh, man.
TED:<br/>I'm not sure what happened to Blah-Blah.
But I'd like to think<br/>that wherever she is, she...
Carol. Her name was Carol.
Thank you.
TED: Sandy Rivers'inappropriate behavior<br/>finally caught up with him...
... ending his news career in America.
[IN RUSSIAN]
TED:<br/>He hasn't changed.
It took some doing, but James finally<br/>convinced Tom to take him back.
And nobody's happier about it<br/>than their kids.
Hey, kids, have I ever told you<br/>how I met your father?
It was at a party.
TED:<br/>And as for Blauman...
Guys, wait.
Sorry for storming off.<br/>I don't wanna miss this wedding.
TED: You will be shocked, kids,<br/>when you discover how easy it is in life...
... to part ways with people forever.
That's why when you find someone<br/>you wanna keep around...
... you do something about it.
So I guess good night.
Good night.
Unless...
Do you wanna walk around some more?<br/>It's still early.
Sure.
What are you doing?
Remembering this.
Come on.

- I bought her a drink, told her I loved her...<br/>- What?
- Kidding.<br/>- Hold on, Roxanne.
- Lf that really is your name.<br/>- It's not. It's Robin.
You played "Have You Met Ted"<br/>without me?
In my bar? With my Ted?
Maybe stealing a bro's wingman<br/>is okay back in...
Sorry, what's the name of this third-world<br/>banana republic you claim to be from?
Canada.
I've literally never heard of that place.
- When did you move here, anyway?<br/>- Two months ago.
- How do you like it?<br/>- It's been a little tough.
I moved here for this on-air reporterjob<br/>at Metro News One...
...thinking it was my big break...
...only to find out<br/>that our viewership mostly consists...
...of DMVwaiting rooms and people<br/>plugging in their TVfor the first time. Heh.
To top it all off, I have no friends.
Um, wrong. You have four friends right here.
- Right, guys?<br/>- Uh, yeah. You're totally in our gang now.
- And once you're in, you're in for life, right?<br/>- She's in.
- All right.<br/>- She's in.
- Welcome.<br/>TED: Oh, yeah.
- Well, if I'm in, I should get the next round.<br/>ALL: Oh!
- I like this girl.<br/>TED: All right.
I'm serious, I like this girl.
And we need some estrogen up<br/>in this bitch.
All we ever talk about is<br/>Scotch and sports.
Five Glen McKennas, 21 years neat.
And switch to the hockey game 'cause<br/>my Canucks are going to bury the Bruins, yo.
So here's the deal with the deal:
Robin's my new best friend.<br/>Nobody bangs her.
Hey, hey, she only rejected me three times.<br/>She's still very much in play.
I'm serious.
There's only one way I'd let either of you<br/>have sex with her.
[GASPS]
Not that. It's never that.
I really want this girl<br/>to stay a part of our lives...
...so the only way you're allowed<br/>to hook up with her...
...is if you marry her.
Too rich for my blood.
TED:<br/>The son of a bitch did it.
- He really did.<br/>- Heh.
So you're moving to Chicago<br/>tomorrow, huh? How do you feel?
I'm looking forward to it.
The job's amazing.<br/>I got a great apartment lined up.
You know, it's exciting.
Onwards and upwa...
[PLAYING SLOW ROCK MUSIC]
BARNEY:<br/>Hey! Bass player.
It's me. The guy from the drugstore<br/>with the diapers who hit on you.
We went outside, had a deep,<br/>emotional talk on a bus bench.
I, uh... I'm gonna be really surprised<br/>if I have to be more specific than that.
Remember when you told me<br/>to stop messing around and go get the girl?
Well, check it, I got her.
[CHUCKLES]
What about you?<br/>You still dating that guy?
Grape Scotch!
Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Right here. Right here.<br/>- Yeah, I see you Barney.
Good, it's time to play<br/>a little game I call "Ha..."
- Barney...<br/>- No. No.
You are not getting out<br/>of "Have You Met Ted."
There's a girl you have to meet.<br/>She is perfect.
And has she met you?<br/>No, she has not.
- Think of all the sex you're gonna have.<br/>- Barney.
I have to go.
What, now?
Yeah.
You...
We have to do this outside.
Robin.
It's been a major pleasure.
- Major Pleasure.<br/>- Major Pleasure.
Come here.
- Congratulations.<br/>ROBIN: Thank you.
Oh, God, no. This is too real.
I can't handle this. Marshall's next.
Marshall?
Good luck out there in Chicago.
I'm gonna be kind ofjealous of you, getting<br/>to have Gazzola's Pizza whenever you want.
- You're gonna be in Rome.<br/>- Yeah, I guess.
[SOBS]
I just... I feel like a hug isn't enough.
E.T. Goodbye?
[MIMICS E.T.]<br/>I'll be right here.
Okay. It helped that<br/>that was really creepy.
- I don't want to see you for a while.<br/>- Ha, ha.
Barney.
Mm.
We licked the Liberty Bell.
We did?
Yeah. You don't remember that?
Uh, I've done a lot of cool stuff, Ted.
Oh, my God.
I just realized.<br/>Who am I gonna high-five now?
- Heh, come on, dude.<br/>- No, I'm being serious.
What if I see a pack of lions<br/>fighting a Tyrannosaurus?
Or, better yet, what if I see boobs?
Who am I gonna high-five then?
- You can high-five Marshall.<br/>- Yeah.
But Marshall only likes<br/>to high-five about Lily boobs.
Oh, always.
Okay, Barney, I have an idea.
One last high-five.
A high-five to echo throughout eternity.
Yes.
And within that high-five will be all<br/>the high-fives we've ever high-fived.
And all the high-fives<br/>we could ever possibly high-five.
- A high-infinity.<br/>- A high-infinity. Exactly.
Let's do this.<br/>All right, everybody, back up.
MARSHALL:<br/>Oh, boy.
"See you on the other side, Ray."
"Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman."
[BOTH YELLING]
[BOTH GROANING]
- Worth it.<br/>- So worth it.
So I rushed out to make the train...
...which is now 45 minutes late.
This lady with the bass guitar,<br/>was she pretty?
Yeah, she was beautiful.
- Go back and meet her.<br/>- Heh, no.
But what if it was destiny?
Lady, it's been a really long weekend.
I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.
I can't really talk destiny right now.
[SIGHS]<br/>Okay.
Yes?
What if the universe<br/>sent you a gigantic sign...
...that this woman was your destiny?
Then would you talk to her?
Yeah, sure.<br/>I mean, I guess I would have to.
- Okay.<br/>- Okay.
Where is that train?
Can I ask one more question?
What?
This girl with the bass guitar...
...is that her?
That is her, isn't it?<br/>Oh, whoo, this is so exciting!
- Go talk to her.<br/>- All right, just be cool, lady! Damn!
Why are you still sitting here?
Because I'm moving<br/>to Chicago tomorrow, remember?
Twenty-four hours from now,<br/>my life is gonna be completely different.
It's just so strange, you know?<br/>Now that Ted's gone...
...there's just a different vibe.
You can just feel his absence.
Are you kidding me?
- Oh, hey.<br/>- Ted, what are you doing here?
Having a drink.
What are you doing in New York?<br/>Aren't you supposed to be in Chicago?
Uh... Oh, yeah, I'm not doing that.
- What?<br/>- What?
- I'm not moving to Chicago.<br/>- Why?
I met a girl.
- You son of a bitch.<br/>- What is the matter with you?
How could you put us through that?<br/>That goodbye was emotionally devastating.
A certain delicate flower<br/>cried all night in the shower.
And I was pretty bummed too.
And now you're staying<br/>because of some girl?
- I mean, who is this person?<br/>- The bass player from the wedding band.
- Oh, yeah, she's great.<br/>- Love her.
Right? Right?
What are...? What are you doing?
- Calling her.<br/>- Don't do this.
Don't call her the next day.
You're blowing this. Three days.<br/>You wait three days, Ted.
Oh, the three-day rule is<br/>a childish manipulative mind game.
But yeah. You wait three days.
Hey, it's Ted.
Hi. Um, listen, do you want<br/>to have dinner tomorrow night?
Great.
It was clear I meant with me, right?
Same answer. Solid.
MARSHALL:<br/>Why does he keep doing this?
He meets them,<br/>he likes them way too much...
...he goes way too big too soon,<br/>he ends up blowing it.
I can't take this anymore.
He's fallen in love so many times now.
Not like this.
This is different.
Come on, go talk to her.
Oh, and it'll all be because of me<br/>and I'll sing at your wedding. Ha, ha.
- You are gonna have a big wedding, right?<br/>- What? No, just be cool, lady! Damn!
Ugh. Aren't big weddings<br/>a young man's game?
You don't have a big wedding<br/>in your thirties.
If I do ever get married,<br/>I'm keeping it simple.
BARNEY: A hot air balloon?<br/>- Well, yeah.
When you're getting married<br/>in a 17th-century castle in France...
...and making your entrance with six<br/>white horses, you gotta make a big exit. Heh.
How much are you spending on this?
Oh, like, a lot of money.
All of my money.
Look, I know you've been traveling a lot,<br/>but you're coming, right?
- Of course.<br/>- Duh.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- I'll get the next round.<br/>- Thanks.
- I'd offer, but castle.<br/>- Yeah.
So how are you guys doing?<br/>Robin's really taking off at work, huh?
It's like, "Robin Scherbatsky,<br/>World Wide News, Caracas."
Or "Robin Scherbatsky,<br/>World Wide News, St. Petersburg."
"Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide News,<br/>anywhere but New York," apparently. Heh.
But it's great. It makes things<br/>super difficult for us, but it's great.
It's great.
- It's great. It's great.<br/>- One more and I'll believe you.
- It's great. Heh.<br/>- Sounds great.
- Hey.<br/>- Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Can I talk to you?<br/>- Sure.
Did you wire the down payment<br/>to the castle guy? I got a castle guy.
I've got like three castle guys.
And a moat guy, so...
- Okay.<br/>- I didn't wire the payment...
...because I don't think<br/>we can get married in September.
- What? What? Why?<br/>- Because when I do get married...
...I kind of want to fit in my dress.
Why wouldn't you f...?
- No.<br/>- Yeah.
- No.<br/>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[TED LAUGHS]
What's going on?
She's getting a boob job.
I just peeked in on Penny asleep<br/>in the baby room. It's adorable.
The whole place looks great, guys.
But I can't believe you let Ted<br/>hang his jousting lance...
...from the Renaissance Faire<br/>on your bedroom wall.
Yeah.
That's Ted's.
- So, Marshall, how's yourjob going?<br/>- My chair is reasonably comfortable...
...for short periods of time.
Marshall has decided to say<br/>only positive things...
...about being back in corporate law.<br/>- So you hate it?
Much of what I do<br/>does not make me cry.
But the job's only temporary.
Marshall was offered the judgeship once,<br/>and he turned it down for me.
So karmically, that phone has<br/>to ring again.
And even if it doesn't, today when my boss<br/>threw his egg salad sandwich at my face...
...some of it got into my mouth,<br/>and it was tasty.
Hey, what about you guys?<br/>How was Argentina?
Great. It was great.
- It was great.<br/>- It was great.
- It was great.<br/>- It was great. It was great.
One more and I'll believe you.
This is so not great!
I'm sorry that I have to work while I'm here.<br/>It's called being on assignment.
Well, what about me?<br/>There's no Wi-Fi in this hotel.
How am I supposed to run a business,<br/>Robin, with no Wi-Fi?
It's not a business, Barney, it's a blog.
It is a lifestyle blog for the upscale,<br/>sophisticated urban gentleman.
And it's never gonna take off<br/>if I can't post today's bonerjoke.
I know I'm always traveling.<br/>We both hate it when I'm gone.
We both hate it when I drag you with me.<br/>Neither of us is happy.
Is this just not working anymore?
Wait, what "this?" "This" this?
If I gave you an out right now...
...if there was an exit ramp right here<br/>at the three-year mark...
...would you take it?
Before I answer that,<br/>wanna get drunk and have sex right now?
Of course.
And then one thing led to another.
And then another.
And then another after that. Oh.
And we kept drinking,<br/>and may have had a little too much.
[IN SPANISH]
[BARNEY SPEAKS IN JAPANESE]
Wow, these rooms all look the same<br/>even when you're sober.
You're sober?
So, um...
...about what we discussed last night...
How do you feel?
I love you, Robin.
And when we got married, I made a vow<br/>that I would always tell you the truth.
We got divorced.
I can't believe you got divorced<br/>without telling us.
This is my mom and dad all over again.
Barney, if you start brewing<br/>your own beer now...
...and nail my prom date, so help me...<br/>- Years too late on one of those.
Guys, it's okay.
This isn't a failed marriage.
It's a successful marriage<br/>that happened to only last three years.
You both want this? For real?
We do.
For real.
Lily, you okay?
Of course I'm not okay.
This ruins everything.<br/>Now we have to choose sides.
And obviously we're gonna choose Robin,<br/>but Barney has his moments.
I really like the bonerjoke of the day.
- You guys do not need to pick sides.<br/>- Nothing has to change.
We've already broken up before<br/>and we've stayed friends, remember?
As long as you promise me<br/>this won't mean we stop hanging out.
- Okay.<br/>- I'm serious.
I know, but I mean,<br/>we hardly hang out anymore anyway.
They live in the suburbs now, and you two<br/>are about to have baby number three.
Please, you're so obvious.
Your gals are back up to a full C-cup...
...and you've been sipping her drink<br/>all night long.
We didn't wanna announce anything<br/>till we knew for sure.
- Oh my gosh, Lily! That's amazing!<br/>TED: Congratulations!
ROBIN: Ha, ha. Oh, my God!<br/>- See, this, right here.
This is why we can't fall out<br/>of each other's lives.
We have to be here for the big moments.
Just promise me, no matter what, we will<br/>always be there for the big moments.
I promise we'll always be there<br/>for the big moments.
See? It's like this whole divorce thing<br/>never happened.
[LILY WHIMPERING]
BARNEY:<br/>L...
- Hey.<br/>- Sweetie, how was work?
My boss only called me three words<br/>that meant vagina today, so...
- How are the kids?<br/>- Asleep.
Good. This is working, right?
Marvin and Daisy sharing a room together?<br/>It's not too cramped?
And then when the next one arrives,<br/>we'll just put her crib in the shower.
It's the perfect size.<br/>It'll save time on clean-ups.
- Let's move somewhere bigger.<br/>- Yes. Oh, thank God.
I mean, you know, don't get me wrong.
I love this apartment. How do you say<br/>goodbye to so many special memories?
- Cockamouse!<br/>- We have to move!
[CHATTERING]
- Hey, Marshall.<br/>- Robin.
Hey, I'm so glad you're here.<br/>It's been forever.
Hey. Where's your costume?
Oh, uh, it's been a crazy week at work,<br/>so no time to go shopping.
- Oh, uh, who are you supposed to be?<br/>- I want to make it clear, this is not my idea.
I'm Captain Ahab.
- Why is it bad if it was your idea?<br/>- Robin, you made it.
A white whale. Got it.
- Oh, hi.<br/>- Heh, hi.
Yeah, I figured, people are thinking it,<br/>might as well steer into the skid, right?
- Where's your costume?<br/>- Oh, I've just been so busy...
Oh, my God!
Marshall, guess whose digits I just scored?<br/>The slutty police officer's...
...tax attorney.
- Hey, Robin.<br/>ROBIN: Hey.
Didn't see you there. Ha, ha.
Saved it.
Sorry, I gotta pee. I'll be back in an hour.
Oh, man. Is Ted still wearing<br/>his hanging chad costume?
How old is that thing?
It's gone from played-out to charmingly<br/>retro and back six or seven times now.
Kind of like Ted himself.
Tonight it's working for him though.
ROBIN:<br/>How do you do this, Ted?
How do you sit out here all night<br/>on the roof, in the cold...
...and still have faith your pumpkin's<br/>gonna show up?
Look, I know that, odds are,<br/>the love of my life...
...isn't gonna magically walk through<br/>that door in a pumpkin costume...
...at 2:43 in the morning...
...but this seems as nice a spot as any<br/>to just, you know, sit and wait.
Um...
Can you tell Lily I had to go?
I gotta split.
Speaking of splits, do you think I can do<br/>a split in mid-air like David Lee Roth?
- I know you can't.<br/>- Challenge accepted.
BARNEY:<br/>Oh! My scrotum!
[SIGHS]
I can't get out of this thing. I'm holding it.
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah, I got a big day tomorrow.<br/>Gotta get some sleep.
No, you can't leave.<br/>This is a big moment.
We're saying goodbye to the apartment.
The whole gang has to be here.
The gang?
Do you know who the gang is to me,<br/>Lily?
Here's what the gang is.
The gang is a married couple,<br/>who I never see anymore...
...about to have their third kid.
It's my ex-husband hitting<br/>on slutty cops right in front of me.
And it's the guy I probably<br/>should have ended up with...
...with the beautiful mother of his child.
Who in their right mind would call<br/>that group of people "the gang"?
Oh.
Oh, so? So, what?
This is all just over then?
Our whole friendship is just over?
No. No, of course not. We'Il...
We'll always be friends. It's just...
...never gonna be how it was.
It can't be.
And that doesn't have to be a sad thing.
There's so much wonderful stuff happening<br/>in all of our lives right now.
More than enough to be grateful for.
But the five of us hanging out<br/>at MacLaren's...
...being young and stupid...
...it's just not one of those things.
That part's over.
I gotta go.
Good night, Lily.
Good night.
[SIGHS]
LILY: Marshall's almost here.<br/>- Yes! Look at us, hanging out again.
This is amazing!<br/>This is awesome! This is...!
[SCREAMS]
Okay, heh, settle down, buddy.
No. Settling down is for losers<br/>with kids who never go out anymore.
I am in charge tonight, and the earliest<br/>I am allowing anyone to go home is...
...2 a.m.<br/>- 10 p.m.
- 9:45.<br/>- 3 a.m.
Guys, tonight is gonna be legen...<br/>Wait for it.
- Lf I leave now, I can put the kids to bed.<br/>- I'll get the check.
- Dary. Legendary!<br/>Guys, the gang is back! We're back!
[YELLS]
All of us except for Robin.<br/>We never see her anymore.
In addition to you guys<br/>not going home before 4 a. M...
Yes, it's up to 4 now.
- New rule, any time anyone<br/>talks about something sad...
...we stay out an extra hour.
We said we'd be there<br/>for the big moments.
- 5 a.m.<br/>- To be fair, tonight's just us...
...hanging out till 10 p.m. Tops,<br/>it's not a big moment.
- Um, yes, it is.<br/>- Um, no, it's not.
- Um, yes, it is.<br/>- Um, no, it's not.
Um, yes, it is.
I got a phone call today.
Ajudge in Queens is retiring...
...so I'm gonna be ajudge.
BARNEY: You are?<br/>TED: Yes! Yes!
[ALL LAUGHING]
Judge Eriksen!
[ALL CHUCKLE]
I told you the phone would ring.<br/>You deserve this.
- Thanks, Lily.<br/>- I love you, Marshmallow.
Ugh, 1:45 a.m.
Well, you were right, Barney.<br/>This night was, in fact, legendary, but...
I know what you're gonna say and I agree.<br/>We're going to Vegas!
I will be awakened by screaming children<br/>in less than...
...four and a half hours.<br/>BARNEY: You're staying.
- I'm going.<br/>- Judge Fudge, your very first ruling?
- He stays.<br/>- Ha! Hey!
See? Tonight is about celebrating<br/>our enduring bond as friends.
Nay, family, because that's what we are,<br/>Ted, we are fam...
- Okay, fun night, guys. Keep in touch.<br/>- Damn it, Barney.
[BARNEY YELLS]
Crushing windpipe.
You're lucky that's the only pipe<br/>I'm crushing.
That woman is half your age.<br/>Haven't you changed even a little?
No. I haven't.
Look, I know there was a time...
...when it seemed like I was capable<br/>of going the distance...
...but if it wasn't gonna happen<br/>with Robin...
...then it's just not<br/>gonna happen with anyone.
I'm never gonna be<br/>a guy who meets a girl...
...and from the first time I see her,<br/>I'm just like:
You are the love of my life.
Everything I have and everything I am<br/>is yours forever.
- Really?<br/>- No, I'm just making a point. Move it along.
That's not me.
I'm the guy who straightens his tie,<br/>says something dirty...
...high-fives himself and then goes<br/>and talks to that girl over there.
That's me.
Can I please just be me?
Judge Fudge?
I'll allow it.
Then I'll a-plow it.<br/>Self-five. Stinson out.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[ALL CHEERING AND YELLING]
So are you guys ever gonna tie the knot,<br/>or are you just comfortable living in sin?
- Someone's gotten a bit judge-y.<br/>- Oh!
- Sustained.<br/>- Yeah.
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,<br/>with life and jobs and kids...
Plus this one's still insisting<br/>on getting married in a French castle.
I'd get married tomorrow in a White Castle,<br/>but this guy needs more "wow factor."
You're all the wow factor I need.
Aw, ugh!
Glad someone can be happy<br/>on the day of a tragedy.
Barney, you know this is all fake, right?<br/>That robot's not really dead.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
I'm not talking about the robot, Lily.<br/>Everyone, stop having fun!
I'm about to tell a sad story!
Guys, remember back in 2010<br/>when I achieved a perfect week?
Seven girls in seven nights, sure.
Well, recently I decided to attempt<br/>a perfect month.
I put together a brand-new playbook.
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.
- But I haven't gotten to the sad part yet.<br/>- You're in your 40s. You have a playbook.
That's the sad part.
Lily, just... Okay?
So I put together a brand-new playbook,<br/>filled with plays I'd never tried before.
Like "The Mannequin"...
... where, as in the '80s classic...
... I magically come to life,<br/>if you know what I mean.
"The Jim Nacho," where I wait<br/>till a girl mentions something she likes.
- God, I love nachos.<br/>- Thank you.
Allow me to introduce myself.<br/>My name is Jim.
Jim Nacho. Inventor of the nacho.
So did you get a perfect month?
Yes.
Then why are you so upset?
That last girl, number 31?
Oh, that's a pretty name.<br/>What is that, French?
She's pregnant.
Wait, you're messing with us.<br/>You didn't really get a girl pregnant.
It's real. She's pregnant.
Kind of puts an asterisk on the whole<br/>"perfect month" thing, huh?
Barney? Are you okay?
Ah! Jim Nantz! Thank goodness.
You're always here for me<br/>in times of trouble. What should I do?
You're on your own this time, bro.
Congratulations, Poppa.
Stop it. This is a disaster.
- Why?<br/>- Why? Because I'm too old.
I was about to enter my golden years.<br/>My Clooney years.
My "daddy issues" years, where I don't just<br/>remind messed-up girls of their dads...
...because I'm emotionally distant.<br/>I freaking look like their dads.
That's the dream.
My life is over.
So where are you guys registered?
TED: Another fun fact about<br/>the Goliath National Bank building?
The sleek but historical facade has been<br/>described by Architecture Vision Monthly...
...as "modern classicism."
- I can see that.<br/>TED: Mm-hm.
- Any questions from the group?<br/>ROBIN: I have a question.
What happened to the building<br/>that used to be here? It was way nicer.
- Robin. Oh, my God.<br/>- Ha, ha.
What are you doing here?<br/>I thought you were in...
Greece, Morocco, Moscow?
Yeah, World Wide News<br/>keeps me pretty busy. Heh.
And pretty famous.<br/>I mean, you're everywhere.
I am not everywhere.
Okay, I'm some places.
Hey, Penny. Oh, my gosh,<br/>I haven't seen you in forever.
- I like you, Bus Lady.<br/>- Aw.
I like you too.<br/>Never call me that again.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
And that was it.
Wow.
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting,<br/>out in nature.
At this point,<br/>that's like seeing Sasquatch.
No, Sasquatch is a warm<br/>and affectionate creature.
At this point, Robin's more like the Yeti,<br/>cold and aloof.
Hey, Ted, ask me<br/>if the Abominable Snowman called.
- Has the Abominable Snowman called?<br/>- Not yeti.
Here we are again.
Another big moment for us<br/>and Robin's missing it.
MARSHALL:<br/>I know, baby.
I mean, the birth<br/>of her ex-husband's love child...
...is a bit of a stretch,<br/>but I know, baby.
Well?
It was crazy in there...
...but I threw up and now I feel better.
- Where were you?<br/>- In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,<br/>so I put this on over my suit.
- Thirty-One won't let me in the room.<br/>- We're gonna need a name eventually.
- Mr. Stinson?<br/>- Yes?
- Congratulations.<br/>- Congratulations because...
...the blood tests came back<br/>and I'm not the father!
Happy Not A Father's Day!
No. Congratulations, it's a girl.
Would you like to meet her?
- No, I'm good.<br/>LILY: Oh, just go say hi to your daughter.
This is Ellie.
I'll give you guys a minute.
You are the love of my life.
[SOBS]
Everything I have...
...and everything I am...
...is yours.
Forever.
- What? Do I have stuff in my teeth?<br/>- Give me your engagement ring back.
Just because I have stuff in my teeth?<br/>We can work through this.
- Just give it back. Heh.<br/>- Heh.
[TED CLEARS THROAT]
Five years is past<br/>the statute of limitations on proposals.
If you don't get married in that time,<br/>you have to re-propose.
- Will you...?<br/>- Yes. Yes, you silly man...
- Let me finish. Will you...?<br/>- Yes. Sorry.
- Yes.<br/>- Will you...?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Will you marry me on Thursday?
I called your office,<br/>you got nothing on Thursday.
- Will you marry me on Thursday?<br/>- Yes. Heh.
Aw. Same ring.
I can't believe it.<br/>It's Ted Mosby's wedding day.
Yes. After only seven years and two kids.
Guys, am I rushing into this? Whoa.
Oh, buddy, are you okay?
So tired.
- Baby no sleepy, Barney dying.<br/>LILY: Ha, ha.
- Well, we're staying out till 3 a.m. Tonight.<br/>- 9:45!
Seriously though,<br/>I am so proud of you.
Now that you're a dad,<br/>it's like you're a totally different pers...
- Whoa.<br/>- And we're back.
- Hey.<br/>- Hi.
Wannajoin us for shots?
Shots? Before lunch on a Thursday?
It's like you're trying<br/>to make bad decisions.
You young ladies need to go home,<br/>put on some decent clothes...
...and take a good, hard look<br/>at your lives.
Get.
Call your parents.<br/>They're probably worried sick.
I have officially seen everything.
Not everything.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi.
I know I've missed a couple lately...
...but we said we'd always be there<br/>for the big moments. Heh.
Aw, crap, mascara running.<br/>Nobody let her out of your sight.
Hi, Daddy. Heh.
Whoa. Look, I'm really happy to see you,<br/>but I don't think of you that way.
No, dummy, you had a kid. Congrats.
- Right, yeah, thanks. A kid. I'm tired.<br/>- Oh, heh.
- But, uh, she's awesome.<br/>- Yeah?
Yeah. Daddy's home.
ROBIN:<br/>Mm.
- Judge Fudge. Heh.<br/>- Hey. Heh.
Actually, um, a little announcement.
I'm gonna be running<br/>for State Supreme Court. Yeah.
So if everything goes well,<br/>in a couple months...
...you won't be calling me<br/>Judge Fudge anymore.
You'll be calling me Fudge Supreme.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
[ROBIN SIGHS]
The man of the hour.
- Heh, you RSVP'd no.<br/>- I did.
But someone pretty persuasive<br/>talked me into it.
Sorry. I know it's bad luck<br/>to see the bride in her dress.
Worth it.
But I couldn't miss this.
I wanna get a picture. Get in.<br/>I wanna take a picture of you guys.
Get together. Heh.
- Okay, ready? All right, get in.<br/>TED: All right.
One, two, three.
Okay.
- Hey. Hey, you kids.<br/>- Yeah, you didn't sound 1000 there.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Do you have any idea what happened<br/>right here in this very bar?
No. What happened?
[CHUCKLES]
Just...
...all kinds of stuff.
- A toast.<br/>ROBIN: Mm-hm.
Okay, first off, to everyone at this table.
- I love you guys so much, I can't even...<br/>- Move to the second part.
- Secondly, to Ted...<br/>- Don't say it.
ALL: Evelyn Mosby.<br/>- Thank you for that.
A man with more emotional endurance<br/>than anyone I know.
It was a long, difficult road.
Thank God we finally got here.
- Here, here.<br/>ALL: Here, here.
TED: Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.<br/>It was, at times, a long, difficult road.
[EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL'S<br/>"DOWNTOWN TRAIN" PLAYING]
But I'm glad it was long and difficult...
... because if I hadn't gone through hell<br/>to get there...
... the lesson might not have been as clear.
You see, kids, right from the moment<br/>I met your mom, I knew:
I have to love this woman<br/>as much as I can...
... for as long as I can,<br/>and I can never stop loving her...
... not even for a second.
I carried that lesson with me<br/>through every stupid fight we ever had.
Every 5 a.m. Christmas morning,<br/>every sleepy Sunday afternoon.
Through every speed bump,<br/>every pang of jealousy or boredom...
... or uncertainty that came our way,<br/>I carried that lesson with me.
And I carried it with me<br/>when she got sick.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Even then, in what can only be called<br/>the worst of times...
... all I could do was thank God.
Thank every God there is<br/>or ever was or will be...
... and the whole universe,<br/>and anyone else I could possibly thank...
Will I see you tonight
TED: ... that I saw that beautiful girl<br/>on that train platform...
... and that I had the guts to stand up,<br/>walk over to her...
... tap her on the shoulder,<br/>open my mouth and speak.
- Excuse me. Hi.<br/>- Hi.
- I'm...<br/>- The best man. Get in here.
- Oh, thanks. Here, let me.<br/>- Uh... Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Great show tonight.<br/>- Oh, thank you. Heh.
- You're Cindy's ex-roommate, right?<br/>- Yeah. And you are the professor.
- I took one of your classes.<br/>- Really? Which one?
- Econ 305.<br/>- Econ 305? I don't teach...
- Oh, no.<br/>- Oh, yeah.
I'm gonnajump onto the tracks now.
No, no, no, don't. You were great.<br/>You were great.
Wait a second.<br/>This is my umbrella.
I left this umbrella at Cindy's.<br/>You totally stole my umbrella.
What? No I didn't.<br/>This is my umbrella, I bought this.
Excuse me, it even has<br/>my initials on it right here.
T.M. Ted Mosby.
Yeah, look again, Ted Mosby.<br/>Those are my initials.
T.M. Tracy McConnell.
Um, no, Tracy McConnell,<br/>it's T.M., totally my umbrella.
Uh, you're T.M., terribly mistaken...
...because this umbrella<br/>has always belonged T.M., to me.
[CHUCKLES]
Although I did lose it<br/>for a few years there. Um...
- So I went to this dance club...<br/>- On St. Patrick's Day.
On St. Patrick's Day.
And you left it there.
And I left it there.
- You never thought you'd see it again.<br/>- And I never thought I'd see it again.
Funny how sometimes you just<br/>find things.
- Hi.<br/>- Hi. Ha, ha.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Every night it's just the same
All upon a downtown train
And that, kids, is how I met your mother.
That's it?
That's it.
No, I don't buy it. That is not the reason<br/>you made us listen to this.
Oh, really? And what's the reason?
Let's look at the facts here.
You made us sit down and listen<br/>to this story about how you met Mom.
Yet Mom's hardly in the story. No.
This is a story about how you're totally<br/>in love with Aunt Robin.
You're thinking about asking her out<br/>and want to know if we're okay.
I can't believe this.
I kept this story short and to the point,<br/>and you guys still missed it.
- The point of the story...<br/>- Is that you totally, totally, totally...
...have the hots for Aunt Robin.
- No, I don't.<br/>- Yes, you do.
- You're grounded.<br/>- Wow. You are really into Aunt Robin.
- You're grounded too.<br/>- Heh.
Okay, suppose I were interested<br/>in Aunt Robin in that way...
...it's not like I'd do anything about it.<br/>I got you guys to think about.
We love Aunt Robin.
Whenever she comes over for dinner,<br/>you guys are so obvious.
Come on, Dad.
Mom's been gone for six years now.<br/>It's time.
What, I just call her up on the phone<br/>and ask her out on a date?
- Yes.<br/>- Yes.
That's something<br/>you guys would want?
- Yes!<br/>- Yes!
All right, I'll give her a call.
- Do it.<br/>- I am.
- Call her.<br/>- I'm calling her.
- Great.<br/>- Here I go.
Or...
[THE WALKMEN'S "HEAVEN" PLAYING]
All right, home sweet home.
[INTERCOM BEEPS]
Wait one second. Okay.
Stay.
Ah. We'll work on that.
[INTERCOM BEEPS]
Television, display front door security.
Television, disp...<br/>Oh, for Pete's sakes.
May come and go
Our crooked dreams will always flow
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Remember, remember
All we fight for<br/>Ripped By mstoll
